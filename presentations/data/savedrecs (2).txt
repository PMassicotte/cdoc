Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean: Optical properties and their relation to CDOM structure and source	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Extensive data exist on the optical properties of CDOM from terrestrial and coastal environments, yet the open oceans have been historically under-sampled. Consequently, the source and structural basis of marine CDOM optical properties are still debated. To address this issue, detailed optical measurements were acquired for both untreated and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduced natural waters and C18 extracts (C18-OM) across the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Except in regions of upwelling or in the vicinity of the Congo River outflow, CDOM absorption coefficients and visible emission intensity were far smaller for surface waters (a(CDOM)(355): 0.057-0.162 m(-1); lambda(ex) /lambda(em) = 350/450 nm: 0.396-1.431 qse) than for waters below the mixed layer (a(CDOM)(355) 0.084-0.344 m(-1); lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 350/450 nm: 0.903-3.226 qse), while spectral slopes were higher (surface: 0.019 to 0.025 nm(-1); deep: 0.013 to 0.019 nm(-1)), consistent with photobleaching of CDOM in surface waters. Distinct emission bands were observed in the ultraviolet, primarily at excitation/emission wavelengths (lambda(ex)/lambda(em)) =280/320 nm, but also at lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 300/340, 300/405 and 320/380 nm for some stations and depths. In contrast, visible emission exhibited maxima that continuously redshifted with increasing lambda(ex) (>330 nm), a property characteristic of CDOM from estuarine and coastal environments. Further evidence that CDOM in the offshore waters of this region is composed of a major terrestrial component includes: 1) similar spectral dependencies of the emission maxima and fluorescence quantum yields; 2) a large Stokes shift in the emission maxima with short-wavelength excitation (lambda(ex) = 280 nm); 3) correlation of visible emission intensities with absorption at lambda(ex) = 280, 320 and 450 nm, with absorption to fluorescence ratios comparable to those found in estuarine and coastal environments; 4) affinity of C18 cartridges for the long wavelength (visible) absorbing and emitting material, but not the UV emitting material; 5) preferential loss of visible absorption and substantially enhanced blue-shifted emission in the visible following borohydride reduction of both the Equatorial Atlantic waters and the C18-OM of these waters. These results support the occurrence in offshore waters of a major terrestrial CDOM component that absorbs in the UV and visible and emits in the visible, as well as marine CDOM components that absorb and emit in the UV. The results further demonstrate that the simultaneous acquisition of complete spectral absorption and emission properties, combined with chemical tests (C-18 extractions, borohydride reduction) can provide a far clearer picture of the sources and cycling of CDOM within the oceans.

A seasonal field study in an oligotrophic coastal system (Blanes Bay, NW Mediterranean)	MARINE CHEMISTRY												A harmonic analysis of three years of data collected with fortnight to monthly frequency in the oligotrophic Bay of Blanes (NW Mediterranean) revealed that the water column mixing-stratification cycle dictated the seasonal build-up of the bulk and different coloured fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) accumulated at late summer, reaching the annual maximum by early September, half a month later than water temperature. The seasonal cycle of the protein-like fluorescence (F(280/350)) was in phase with DOC, suggesting that reduced heterotrophic activity, due to severe P limitation, is likely the reason behind the late summer accumulation of these materials. The absorption due to conjugated carbon double bonds of DOM (a(CDOM)(254)) reached the annual maximum by early August, concomitant to the seasonal maximum of microbial activity, suggesting that biological production prevailed over photo-degradation of these compounds. On the contrary, the fluorescence of humic-like substances absorbing in the UV-A region (F(340/440)) presented the annual maximum in early February, coinciding with the seasonal maximum of autotrophic biomass, and the minimum in early August, because of the prevalence of photo-degradation over microbial production. The optical properties of DOM allowed distinguishing between three DOC pools of contrasting origin, photo- and bio-reactivity, in the oligotrophic NW Mediterranean Sea.

Wastewater treatment plants are key barriers to their discharge into the environment. The aggregation behavior of aqueous suspensions of C-60 nanoparticles (nC(60)) could affect their transport, bioavailability, and removal during wastewater treatment. We tested the aggregation of nC(60) in wastewater at different values of pH, ionic strength, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The nC(60) remained relatively stable in filtered wastewater under environmentally relevant conditions up to 24 h. But at pH 3 or at high ionic strength (>100 mM NaCl), the aggregate size increased greatly, reaching micrometer scale after only 1 h. However, the aggregation behavior varied among wastewater samples even at values of similar zeta potential, compared with that in filtered secondary effluent and aeration tank liquor, that in filtered primary effluent was obviously inhibited. This inhibition could be attributed to the steric stabilization due to the adsorption of DOM on nC(60) aggregate in addition to electrostatic stabilization. The aggregation results also suggest that membrane filtration could be improved by adjustments to pH. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Liu, CC; Chen, GB				Liu, Cheng-Chung; Chen, Guan-Bu			Reclamation of cadmium-contaminated soil using dissolved organic matter solution originating from wine-processing waste sludge	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Soil washing using an acid solution is a common practice for removing heavy metals from contaminated soil in Taiwan. However, serious loss of nutrients from soil is a major drawback of the washing. Distillery sludge can be used to prepare a dissolved organic matter (DOM) solution by extracting its organic constituents with alkaline solutions. This study employed DOM solutions to remediate Cd-contaminated soil (with concentrations up to 21.5 mg kg(-1)) and determine the factors affecting removal of Cd, such as pH, initial concentration of DOM solution, temperature, and washing frequency. When washing with pH 3.0 and 1250 mg L-1 DOM solution, about 80% and 81% of Cd were removed from the topsoil at 27 degrees C and subsoil at 40 degrees C, respectively. To summarize the changes in fertility during DOM washing with various pH solutions: the increase in organic matter content ranged from 7.7% to 23.7%; cation exchange capacity (CEC) ranged from 4.6% to 13.9%; available ammonium (N-NH4) content ranged from 39.4% to 2175%; and available phosphorus content ranged from 34.5% to 182%: Exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg remained in the topsoil after DOM washing, with concentrations of 1.1, 2.4, and 1.5 times higher than those treated with HCl solution at the same pH, respectively.

Surface seawater samples (100 L) were subjected to tangential flow ultrafiltration (10,000 Da cut off) for isolating and pre-concentrating dissolved large molecules. The isolated fraction (retentate) consisted of 1 L, which was further freeze-dried and re-dissolved to 250 mL with ultrapure water. After HI Trap desalting of the re-dissolved retentate, SEC with UV detection showed marine DOM ranging from 6.5 kDa (lower than the permeable volume of the SEC column) to 16 kDa. A further characterization of this fraction by AEC with UV detection revealed the existence of four groups of macromolecules exhibiting retention times of 2.3, 2.8, 4.5 and 14.0 min. AEC hyphenated with ICP-MS showed the presence of strontium and zinc in the first AE fraction isolated from the SEC fraction; while manganese was found to be bound to the second AE fraction. Cobalt was found to be bound to molecules comprising the third AE fraction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bioconcentration of benzo[a]pyrene in Chironomus riparius and Lumbriculus variegatus in relation to dissolved organic matter and biotransformation	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The relative health of benthic invertebrate populations is threatened by both dissolved and strongly-bound contaminants. Sediment-bound contaminants can be mobilized and metabolized in the guts of deposit-feeders and may lead to even more potent derivatives. For this reason, measures of parent substance concentrations in organisms are not a suitable exposure indicator when substantial biotransformation can occur. In this study, we assessed the concentration of waterborne C-14-benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in Chironomus riparius larvae and in the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus at different levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These two species have different biotransformation capabilities. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber was used to assess the freely-dissolved concentrations for the prediction of uptake and elimination kinetics. Exposure concentrations decreased due to the presence of DOC. Radioactivity that corresponded to the metabolites exceeded 90% of total extractable fractions in C. riparius, and suggested that BaP metabolism was faster than uptake from solution. However, only 10% of the extracted activity was attributed to metabolites in L. variegatus. Measured tissue concentrations and model-predicted uptake and elimination rates showed that L. variegatus mainly accumulated parent compound, whereas C. riparius accumulated mainly metabolites. No effect of DOC was observed on the biotransformation of BaP in either species.																	1463-4988					JAN 2	2013	16	1					70	77		10.1080/14634988.2013.753827						WOS:000319171200008

There was no noticeable effect of increased CO2 concentration on short-term decomposition of labile DOM or nutrient uptake. However, microbial activities producing new DOM were apparently enhanced under treatments with 2000 or 5000 ppm CO2. Under these conditions, production of aggregates was inhibited in early stage. Both of acute and chronic effects should be included for assessment of biogeochemical cycle related to microbe process. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The results showed that fulvic-like, tryptophan-like and humic acids-like matters were the main compounds in leachate. During photocatalytic treatment process, fluorescence spectroscopy of DOM changed considerably. The final products were mainly fulvic-like and tryptophan-like matters. In general, the fluorescence signals of humic acids-like matters had the most significant change, which disappeared entirely after 60 h treatment, implying that humic acids-like matters can be degraded preferentially by photocatalysis. The other notable change was in VIS fulvic-like matters region, which suggested that fulvic-like matters can be significantly degraded. In 72 h photocatalytic effluent, VIS fulvic-like, tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like matters were remained, and the last two matters were the dominant fractions. These results indicated that fulvic-like and humic acids-like matters with macromolecular can be degraded into protein-like matters with micro-molecular by photocatalysis.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-742-7				2013	726-731						122	126		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.122						WOS:000333767500027

Profiles of dissolved organic matter and haloacetic acid formation potential in drinking water treatment by a comprehensive fractionation technique	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												A comprehensive fractionation technique was applied to a set of water samples obtained along a real drinking water treatment plant with ozonation and granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment to obtain detailed profiles of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and to evaluate the haloacetic acid (HAA) formation potentials of these DOM fractions. The results indicated that ozonation and GAC treatment showed limited ability to remove hydrophilic fractions (23%), while removal of hydrophobic fractions was 72%. The contribution of hydrophilic fractions to HAA formation increased from 30 to 61% along the treatment train because of better removal for hydrophobic fractions both in concentration and reactivity.

Depth-dependent molecular composition and photo-reactivity of dissolved organic matter in a boreal lake under winter and summer conditions	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in boreal lakes lead to large greenhouse gas emissions as well as substantial carbon storage in sediments. Using novel molecular characterization approaches and photochemical degradation experiments we studied how seasonal patterns in water column stratification affected the DOM in a Swedish lake under early spring and summer conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were consistently higher above the sediment when compared to surface waters throughout the sampling periods. Photobleaching alone could not explain this difference in DOC because the lake was covered by 40 cm-thick ice during late winter sampling and still showed the same DOC trend. The differences in the molecular diversity between surface DOM in winter and summer were consistent with ongoing photobleaching/ decarboxylation and a possible bacterial consumption of photo-products. Additional photo-degradation experiments using simulated sunlight showed a production of highly oxidized organic molecules and low molecular weight compounds in all late winter samples and also in the deep water sample in summer. In the surface summer DOM sample, few such molecules were produced during the photo-degradation experiments, confirming that DOM was already photobleached prior to the experiments. This study suggests that photobleaching, and therefore also the ice cover during winter, plays a central role in surface DOM transformation, with important differences in the molecular composition of DOM between surface and deep boreal lake waters. The release of DOC from boreal lake sediments also contribute to this pattern. Photochemical degradation of DOM may be more extensive following ice-out and water column turnover when non-light exposed and thereby photosensitive DOM is photo-mineralized. Hence, the yearly DOM photo-mineralization may be greater than inferred from studies of recently light-exposed DOM.

Bioavailability of riverine dissolved organic matter in three Baltic Sea estuaries and the effect of catchment land use	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The microbial degradation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) was studied in three Finnish boreal estuaries with contrasting land use patterns (Kiiminkijoki - natural forest and peatland; Kyronjoki - agricultural; Karjaanjoki - mixed/urban). Bioassays of 12-18 d long durations were used in 3 seasons at in situ temperatures. Besides the bulk parameters, a suite of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality parameters were also investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM and the molecular weight of DOM. Bioavailable DOC and DON pools varied significantly between the estuaries, from 7.9 to 10.6% and from 5.5 to 21.9 %, respectively. DOM originating from the catchment dominated by natural forests and peatlands (Kiiminkijoki) had the lowest DOC and DON degradation rates, as well as the lowest proportions of biodegradable DOC and DON. A greater proportion of agricultural land in the catchment increased the bioavailability of DON, but not the bioavailability of DOC (Kyronjoki). Additionally, DOM quality varied significantly between the estuaries, and DOM originating from the agricultural Kyronjoki catchment sustained higher DOC and DON degradation rates and higher bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) compared to those of the natural forest and peat dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment. The quality of DOM, indicated by differences in CDOM, fluorescent DOM and molecular weight, varied between estuaries with differing land use and was concluded to be major driver of BGE of these systems and thereafter to the microbial CO2 fluxes from the estuaries. The differences in BGE resulted in a 5-fold difference in the calculated daily bacterial CO2 emissions between the study's estuaries due to bacterial activity, ranging from 40 kg C d(-1) in the Karjaanjoki estuary to 200 kg C d(-1) in the Kyronjoki estuary. Lower DOC : DON ratios, smaller molecular weight and higher CDOM absorption spectral slope values of DOM resulted in higher proportion of the initial DOC and DON being transferred to microbial growth and therefore to the pelagic food web. The pristine, peatland and forest-dominated Kiiminkijoki catchment had the lowest BGE, and therefore proportionally highest CO2 fluxes.

Photobleaching as a factor controlling spectral characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in open ocean	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) ubiquitously occurs in marine environments and plays a significant role in the marine biogeochemical cycles. Basin scale distributions of CDOM have recently been surveyed in the global ocean and indicate that quantity and quality of oceanic CDOM are mainly controlled by in situ production and photobleaching. However, factors controlling the spectral parameters of CDOM in the UV region, i.e., spectral slope of CDOM determined at 275-295 nm (S275-295) and the ratio of two spectral slope parameters (S-R); the ratio of S275-295 to S350-400, have not been well documented. To evaluate the factor controlling the spectral characteristics of CDOM in the UV region in the open ocean, we determined the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of CDOM in the subarctic and subtropical surface waters (5-300 m) of the western North Pacific. Absorption coefficients at 320 nm in the subarctic region were higher than those in the subtropical region throughout surface waters, suggesting that magnitudes of photobleaching were different between the two regions. The values of S275-295 and SR were also higher in the subtropical region than the subarctic region. The dark microbial incubation showed biodegradation of DOM little affected S275-295, but slightly decreased SR. On the other hand, increases in S275-295 and relative stableness of SR were observed during photo-irradiation incubations respectively. These experimental results indicated that photobleaching of CDOM mainly induced qualitative differences in CDOM at UV region between the subarctic and subtropical surface waters. The results of this study imply that S275-295 can be used as a tracer of photochemical history of CDOM in the open ocean.

The assemblages were exposed to (1) decreased temperature, (2) decreased temperature and phosphate addition or (3) decreased temperature, phosphate addition and lowered oxygen level. Bacterial and viral abundances as well as bacterial community composition stabilized during the second week of the experiment. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed dramatic reductions in bacterial diversity in all treatments and major compositional differences relative to the inoculum. Nevertheless, no differences in the ability to exploit dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were found for the acquired communities relative to the inoculum, indicating that the bacterial communities were functionally redundant. We speculate that oscillations in exploitation of the DOC pool in situ are mainly governed by factors limiting the overall bacterial growth, rather than perturbations affecting only subsets of the microbial biota.

Aromatic protein materials were the major components for DOM in both waters, which consisted of small-molecular size and low level of aromatic carbon. While the content of fulvic- and humic-like materials was low, these materials contained macro-molecules and high level of aromatic. The abundance of soluble microbial byproducts was the lowest one. The components of DOM from the surface water rendered decreasing gradients from tributaries to confluent estuary, while this trend was not obvious in the pore water due to sediment dredging in the tributaries. The fulvic- and humic-like materials and microbial byproducts were more significant discriminant parameters of spatial variation than aromatic protein materials.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2013	22	10A					3041	3047								WOS:000327108100011

Here, we assessed the effect of photoaltered CDOM derived from Schoenoplectus californicus and Ruppia maritima on the composition and production of a bacterial community from a productive subtropical coastal lagoon. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter from plants extracts was characterised by optical methods before and after exposure to natural full solar radiation. Afterwards, bacteria from the lagoon were added and incubated in these extracts for 5 h. We found that CDOM from the plant extracts underwent photoalteration after exposure to natural solar radiation, inducing shifts in the original bacterial community composition. In both macrophyte extracts, the bacterial community significantly changed and became dominated by two populations with distinctive morphology. The main enriched bacteria in both plant extracts were large filaments that made up to 99% of the community biovolume. In the R. maritima extract, another type of enriched bacteria was detected, consisting of large rods. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that the enriched bacterial populations belonged to Exiguobacterium sp. (filaments) and Acinetobacter sp. (rods). Morphotype identities were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation using specific probes targeting those taxa. Our results suggest that solar-induced photoalteration of plant material in this coastal lagoon results in the growth of opportunistic bacterial taxa.

The total luminescence spectra (TLS) of CDOM in several types of water samples with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements using a 405 nm wavelength excitation source were measured in the laboratory, and the spectra of CDOM were pointed out and obtained with spectral fluorescence signature (SFS) technique. The spectrum of water Raman scattering and fluorescence of CDOM were separated from TLS with fitting Gaussian of the least squares method, and the curve of fluorescence peak intensity of CDOM against corresponding concentration of CDOM is showed. High correlation (R-2 = 0.93) was observed between concentration of CDOM and fluorescence normalized to water Raman scattering. The results have presented the capability of the LIF technique as an integrated tool for research and observations.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9722-2				2013	8872								88720N	10.1117/12.2022703						WOS:000326708100015

The MBR was operated with fouled and cleaned membranes, at a time. DOM, mixed liquor, and effluent were characterized by fractionation and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. Results showed DOM removals of 82% during the MBR operation with the fouled membrane. The DOM characterization indicated that most of the hydrophilic compounds and protein-like substances could be significantly removed by microbial activities in the treatment processes. Furthermore partial removal or transformation of organic substances was observed during membrane filtration. The fouled membrane improved DOM rejection by only about 2% when compared to the cleaned membrane, which demonstrated the significance of irreversible foulants on DOM rejection. There were insignificant differences in DOM fractionation and EEM fluorescence spectra between water samples filtered through the fouled and cleaned membranes.

The results indicate that, the primary component of CDOM is humic-like. The secondary component is tryptophan-like, which is the product of phytoplankton and aquatic debris rather than the wastewater treatment drainaged from city. In this study, six fluorophores with multiple excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) peaks (A, B, C, N, M, T) were identified according to the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The average contribution of each component to the CDOM is 19.93, 18.82, 16.88, 16.39, 12.26, and 15.72%, respectively. Red Shifted phenomenon will happen with the increase of fluorescence intensity for ultraviolet and terrestrially humic-like. Conversely, marine humic-like will appear Reverse Red Shifted with the increase of fluorescence intensity. The primary contributor to the shoulder value of CDOM's absorption coefficient at 275 nm is phytoplankton productivity, followed by marine humic-like. The main contributors to the shoulder shape are UV humic-like and phytoplankton productivity, followed by marine humic-like and tryptophan-like. A strong correlation between CDOM absorption and fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength of 424 nm and excitation wavelength ranging from 280 to 360 nm was found. The absorption coefficient can be retrieved successfully from the same excitation wavelength's fluorescence intensity by an exponential model.				huang, changchun/E-6580-2016; huang, changchun/R-5236-2016	huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X; huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663												1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	2					326	335		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e26						WOS:000324045100011

Technical Note: Dissolved organic matter fluorescence - a finite mixture approach to deconvolve excitation-emission matrices	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The analysis of the shape of excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) is a relevant tool for exploring the origin, transport and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems. Within this context, the decomposition of EEMs is acquiring a notable relevance. A simple mathematical algorithm that automatically deconvolves individual EEMs is described, creating new possibilities for the comparison of DOM fluorescence properties and EEMs that are very different from each other. A mixture model approach is adopted to decompose complex surfaces into sub-peaks. The laplacian operator and the Nelder-Mead optimisation algorithm are implemented to individuate and automatically locate potential peaks in the EEM landscape. The EEMs of a simple artificial mixture of fluorophores and DOM samples collected in a Mediterranean river are used to describe the model application and to illustrate a strategy that optimises the search for the optimal output.

Seasonal changes in photochemical properties of dissolved organic matter in small boreal streams	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in lakes and streams is significantly affected by photochemical transformation of DOM. A series of laboratory photochemical experiments was conducted to describe seasonal changes in photochemical properties of DOM. The stream samples used in this study originated from three different catchments in the southernmost part of the Boreal ecozone near Dorset, Ontario, Canada. A first-order kinetics equation was used to model photochemical degradation of DOM and the kinetic rate constant, K, was used as an indicator of photochemical properties of DOM. Kinetic rate constants from all three catchments showed a sinusoidal pattern during the hydrological year. K increased steadily during autumn and winter and decreased during spring and summer with a more than 3-fold range in each stream. The highest values were observed during spring melt events when DOM was flushed from terrestrial sources by high flows. The minimum rate constants were found in summer when discharge was lowest. K was strongly correlated with pH and iron. DOM molecular weight and specific absorbance at 254 nm also exhibited annual cycles corresponding to the seasonal cycles of terrestrial organic matter, but the relationships between these properties and K differed between seasons and may have been affected by previous exposure to solar radiation during transit from the catchment.

Linkage between the temporal and spatial variability of dissolved organic matter and whole-stream metabolism	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important resource for microbes, thus affecting whole-stream metabolism. However, the factors influencing its chemical composition and thereby also its bio-availability are complex and not thoroughly understood. It was hypothesized that whole-stream metabolism is linked to DOM composition and that the coupling of both is influenced by seasonality and different land-use types. We tested this hypothesis in a comparative study on two pristine forestry streams and two non-forestry streams. The investigated streams were located in the Harz Mountains (central Europe, Germany). The metabolic rate was measured with a classical two-station oxygen change technique and the variability of DOM with fluorescence spectroscopy. All streams were clearly net heterotrophic, whereby non-forestry streams showed a higher primary production, which was correlated to irradiance and phosphorus concentration. We detected three CDOM components (C1, C2, C3) using parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. We compared the excitation and emission maxima of these components with the literature and correlated the PARAFAC components with each other and with fluorescence indices. The correlations suggest that two PARAFAC components are derived from allochthonous sources (C1, C3) and one is derived autochthonously (C2). The chromophoric DOM matrix was dominated by signals of humic-like substances with a highly complex structure, followed by humic-like, fulfic acids, low-molecular-weight substances, and with minor amounts of amino acids and proteins. The ratios of these PARAFAC components (C1 : C2, C1 : C3, C3 : C2) differed with respect to stream types (forestry versus non-forestry). We demonstrated a significant correlation between gross primary production (GPP) and signals of autochthonously derived, low-molecular-weight humic-like substances. A positive correlation between P/R (i.e. GPP/daily community respiration) and the fluorescence index FI suggests that the amount of autochthonously produced DOM increased overall with increasing GPP. In accordance with the coupling between DOM and the metabolism, our data also indicate that the composition of DOM is subject to seasonal fluctuations. We concluded that temporal and spatial differences in DOM composition are driven by whole-stream metabolism, in addition to pronounced effects coming from allochthonous sources.

Stability of nano-sized titanium dioxide in an aqueous environment: effects of pH, dissolved organic matter and divalent cations	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nano-sized titanium dioxide in the aquatic environment has a potential impact on the environment and human health. In this study, the impact of pH value, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and divalent cations (Ca2+) on the stability of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) in an aqueous environment was investigated in batch tests. The results showed that the particle size of nano-TiO2 was not sensitive to pH value but was inversely proportional to zeta potential. The nano-TiO2 becomes more stable with surface zeta potential, accompanied by small particle size and high dispersion. In the presence of DOM, the particle size was smaller and the stability of nano-TiO2 could be enhanced. This might be a synergistic effect of the ligand exchange and electrostatic force. Particle size increased with the addition of Ca2+ and the stability decreased.																	0273-1223						2013	68	2					276	282		10.2166/wst.2013.165						WOS:000322886600002	23863417

Solution-state NMR investigation of the sorptive fractionation of dissolved organic matter by alkaline mineral soils	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Sorption to clay minerals is a prominent fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in terrestrial environments. Previous studies have observed that DOM is selectively fractionated by interactions with both pure clay minerals and acidic mineral soils. However, the specific DOM functional groups that preferentially sorb to mineral surfaces in alkaline soils require further examination because higher basicity could change the nature of these sorptive interactions. Biosolids-derived DOM was characterised using one- and two-dimensional solution-state NMR spectroscopy before and after sorption to three alkaline subsurface mineral soils with varying mineralogy. Carboxylic DOM components sorbed preferentially to all soils, likely due to cation bridging and ligand exchange mechanisms. Aliphatic constituents were selectively retained only by a soil with high clay mineral content, possibly by van der Waals interactions with montmorillonite surfaces. Polar carbohydrate and peptide components of the DOM did not exhibit preferential sorption and may remain mobile in the soil solution and potentially stimulate microbial activity. A relatively low signal from aromatic DOM components prevented a full assessment of their sorption behaviour. The results suggest that DOM is selectively fractionated by similar interactions in both acidic and alkaline soils that may play a key role in the chemical and biochemical processes of subsurface environments.

The soils were characterized by pH, water and ash content, total organic carbon (TOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and elements. Up to 1 mmol/L, Freundlich isotherm fits the measured data with a correlation of 0.999. For the total concentration range (0.01 mmol/L 20 mmol/L), the Langmuir isotherm fits slightly better than Freundlich isotherm with correlation coefficients from 0.984 - 0.991. The maximum adsorbable mass calculated from Langmuir model was 16.670 mg/kg for Cu and 125.000 mg/kg for Pb. The high adsorption capacity of the Harz soils was corresponding with very low concentrations of heavy metals in the soil eluates. Adsorption rates of Cu and Pb from pure water solutions were slightly higher than from soil eluates. The complex formation of metals with DOM in the eluates is supposed to be responsible for this finding. An ecotoxicity test with the soil eluates from the adsorption experiments was performed with Lepidium sativum garden cress seeds. Cu was found to be obviously more toxic towards L. sativum than Pb. A relatively high toxicity of Cu and low uptake of this metal by the plants is assumed to be responsible for the decreasing accumulation factors of Cu concentration in the seedlings. In contrast to Cu, the accumulation factors of Pb did not have a regularly trend, presumably due to its comparably low toxicity. Finally, the presence of dissolved organic matter in soil eluates was found to decrease the ecotoxicity of the heavy metals for L. sativum in low concentrations. However, in total, the influence of DOM on the bioavailability and toxicity on the root and hypocotyl growth seems to be relatively low.																	1018-4619						2013	22	2					318	327								WOS:000321721600002

This research examined the effect of attapulgite (AT) addition on dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal characteristics in a dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR). Results indicated the DOM in the attapulgite-added DMBR system decomposed more rapidly than in the DMBR system. Hence, the attapulgite-added DMBR system had a higher DOM removal rate in term of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and UV254 concentration. Due to the hybrid effect of adsorption and co-precipitation on DOM after the addition of attapulgite, the characteristics of DOM in the two bioreactors differed considerably. The analysis of molecular weight distribution by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) showed that attapulgite-amended DMBR exhibited greater retention efficiency for large molecules than the DMBR without the addition of attapulgite. Attapulgite addition decreased hydrophilic compounds (HPI) concentration from 4.74 mg/L to 3.61 mg/L in the supernatant of attapulgite-added DMBR. Hydrophobic fractions of DOM showed little difference in concentrations in the effluent of two bioreactors. Bacterial community structures and abundances in membrane bioreactor were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The analyses indicate that there may be a link between the diversity and quantity of bacterial populations and DOM removal.																	1018-4619						2013	22	3A					853	861								WOS:000320901600011		
J	Tareq, SM; Maruo, M; Ohta, K				Tareq, Shafi M.; Maruo, Masahiro; Ohta, Keiichi			Characteristics and role of groundwater dissolved organic matter on arsenic mobilization and poisoning in Bangladesh	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The fluorescence and molecular weight characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater of Bangladesh were investigated to evaluate its multiple roles on arsenic (As) mobilization and poisoning. Fluorescence properties of DOM were measured in groundwater samples collected from two As contaminated areas of Bangladesh (Faridpur at the Ganges floodplain and Sonargaon at the Meghna floodplain) from different locations and depths. The three dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectra of groundwater samples showed two characteristic peaks around Ex/Em = 335-365 nm/435-480 nm for fulvic-like peaks and peak at around Ex/Em = 275-290 nm/310-335 nm for the protein-like materials. The similarity of fluorescence spectra of groundwater and surface water of both the study areas with high intensity of fluorescence and its strong correlation with DOC reflect the in situ generation of fluorescent DOM from sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and recent recharge of terrestrial labile organic carbon into shallow aquifer. High performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) analysis of DOM shows positive correlations between fluorescence intensities (FI) of small molecular fractions (0.65 kDa) and As concentrations, with the signatures of protein-like peaks of DOM in groundwater. This result provides new evidence that small molecular weight fraction of DOM in groundwater of Bangladesh can play an important role on As mobilization and toxicity. In addition, high concentration of fluorescence materials in DOM of As contaminated groundwater of Bangladesh may pose a threat to public health. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental results showed that the leachate from Erfeishan landfill with low COD was relatively steady after long-time natural environmental evolution. DOM dominating the main organic component of the leachate was up to 90% of TOC. Biodegradation was comparatively poor due to low BOD/COD (0.09) as an index meaning that the main component was refractory organics in the leachate. DOM in the leachate was separated into six fractions: hydrophobic acid (HOA), hydrophobic base (HOB), hydrophobic neutral (HON), hydrophilic acid (HIA), hydrophilic base (HIB), and hydrophilic neutral (HIN). The content of different DOM fractions were in descending order as: HOA > U HON > U HIA > U HIN > U HOB > U HIB. The photocatalytic removal efficiency of COD was up to 60%, more than 74% for DOC, respectively. BOD/COD continued to increase from initial 0.09 to about 0.39 during the whole photocatalytic treatment process, which indicated that biodegradation ability of leachate was improved by photocatalysis. The DOM content was reduced sharply after photocatalytic treatment. However, the HIA fraction kept almost steady in all treatment samples, the HOA fraction changed slowly in 24 h, and changed obviously after 36 h treatment, the HIB fraction increased slowly in 36 h, and decreased obviously after 36 h, and the HOB fraction decreased sharply in 6 h, increased from 6 h to 24 h, after 24h decreased,. The other two fractions (HON and HIN) decreased steadily during all treatment process. The predominant fraction in the raw leachate was HOA (30.5% of DOC), while the dominant fraction in the final effluent was HIA (69.4% of DOC).																			978-0-7695-4923-1				2013							1594	1598		10.1109/ISDEA.2012.383						WOS:000319283600379

The objective of the present study was to determine how an increase in the supply of bioavailable DOM affects bacterial metabolism and diversity. We addressed this issue by growing a natural bacterial community over 5 generations in continuous cultures either on seawater (dissolved organic carbon concentration equal to 74 mu M) or on seawater amended with 13 mu M of diatom-derived DOM. Bacteria markedly responded to the additional DOM supply, as revealed by 1.6-fold higher bacterial abundances and 10-fold higher cell-specific alpha- and beta-glucosidase activities in the +DOM treatment than in the control throughout the experimental period. Analysis of diversity as determined by tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes after 3 and 5 bacterial generations showed that the bacterial communities in the +DOM treatment were more similar to each other than to communities in the control. Diversity indices such as richness and phylogenetic distance were higher in the DOM-amended cultures than in the control. Gammaproteobacteria dominated the communities selected in our cultures, representing between 87 and 99% of the sequences. The addition of DOM led to a higher relative abundance of several bacterial groups, in particular Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia, which accounted for up to 14% of the sequences, compared to the control in which they represented <5% of the sequences. Our results demonstrate that in this experimental context, an increased supply of bioavailable DOM sustained a higher bacterial diversity.				blain, stephane/F-6917-2010; Cottrell, Matthew/C-3266-2009; Obernosterer, Ingrid/A-5434-2011	blain, stephane/0000-0002-5234-2446; 												0948-3055						2013	69	2					157	+		10.3354/ame01632						WOS:000319513200007

Characterization of dissolved organic matter from a Greenland ice core by nanospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Nanospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry was developed as a tool for examining the dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in ice cores, significantly reducing the sample volume required for extraction compared with previous studies. Using smaller sample volumes is important for resolving temporal changes in ice-core DOM. We demonstrate that a small volume of ice-core meltwater can be extracted and analyzed with sufficient mass spectral sensitivity to describe the molecular composition of the DOM. Two different solid-phase extraction resins (PPL and C-18) were compared to examine potential fractionation of the DOM. Over 2500 unique molecular formulas isolated from two different Greenland ice-core samples, dated to approximately AD 1660 and AD 1360, were obtained from the analyses. Method and sensitivity improvements provide an opportunity for organic matter characterization at higher temporal resolution than our previous analyses afforded and allows for examination of ice cores containing low levels of organic carbon.																	0022-1430	1727-5652					2013	59	214					225	232		10.3189/2013JoG12J061						WOS:000319716100002

Insights into dissolved organic matter complexity in rainwater from continental and coastal storms by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A series of seven rainwater samples were collected in Wilmington, North Carolina USA originating from both continental and coastal storms and analyzed by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). This data set is unique in that it represents a detailed comparison of the molecular level composition of DOM in rainwater collected from distinctly different air mass back trajectories by FT-ICR MS. Approximately 25% of the roughly 2000 assigned CHO molecular formulas are unique to a single storm classification indicating the importance of air mass back trajectory on the composition of rainwater dissolved organic matter (DOM). Analysis of the unique molecular formula assignments highlighted distinct groupings of various bio- and geo-molecule classes with coastal storms containing unique formulas representative of lignin and cellulose-like formulas while continental storms had lipid-like formulas. A series of 18 distinct methylene oligomers were identified in coastal storms and 13 unique methylene oligomers in continental storms, suggesting oligomer formation is ubiquitous in rainwater albeit different for each storm classification. Oligomers of small acids and C3H4O2 were detected in both storm types indicating their processing may be similar in both back trajectories. Condensed aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in continental storms with phenol moieties that are not as oxidized as similar compounds detected in aquatic DOM.																	1680-7316						2013	13	9					4829	4838		10.5194/acp-13-4829-2013						WOS:000318941300023

Trichodesmium-derived dissolved organic matter is a source of nitrogen capable of supporting the growth of toxic red tide Karenia brevis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) produced by the nitrogen-fixer Trichodesmium sp. has the potential to serve as a nitrogen source for the red tide dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from laboratory cultures of Trichodesmium sp. was isolated, concentrated and then supplied as a nutrient source to K. brevis cells collected from the Gulf of Mexico. K. brevis abundance increased immediately after Trichodesmium sp. cellular exudate (TCE) addition, allowing the population to double within the first 24 h. There was rapid and complete utilization of the TCE DON as well as similar to 89% of the TCE dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Additionally, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) was used to assess the bacterial community response to the addition of TCE. The number of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) initially increased after the TCE DOM addition, but decreased as K. brevis reached its maximum abundance. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) were used to chemically characterize the DOM. Approximately 25% of compounds disappeared within the first 24 h, corresponding to the greatest increase in K. brevis abundance. Using FT-ICR MS, 391 DON and 219 DOP potentially bioavailable compounds were characterized. The bioavailable DON compounds were highly reduced and 44% had molar ratios indicative of lipid or protein-like compounds. The changes in DON concentration and compound composition show that Tricho desmium sp. provides a sufficient source of nitrogen to directly or indirectly support K. brevis blooms.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	483						31	45		10.3354/meps10258						WOS:000319680700003

Dissolved organic matter quantity and quality in Lake Simcoe compared to two other large lakes in southern Ontario	INLAND WATERS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component in ecosystem processes and is the largest pool of organic carbon (C) in aquatic environments. In this study, we investigated the variability in quantity and quality of DOM in 3 large lakes in southern Ontario. Water quality parameters were coupled with excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy and absorption spectra to characterize the DOM and investigate the overarching factors controlling DOM dynamics. The results show that Lake Simcoe has higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations than lakes Erie, Ontario, and Hamilton Harbour (an embayment in western Lake Ontario) and suggest that a DOM source independent of watershed inputs is likely an important contributor to the DOC in this system. Five components were identified through parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), representative of both terrestrial and microbial origin. Their relative intensities in the 4 Lake Simcoe end-members allowed the identification of dominant DOM sources in our studied ecosystems. Lake Simcoe seems to have a similar contribution of agriculturally derived DOM to lakes Erie, Ontario, and Hamilton Harbour. Lake Ontario, including Hamilton Harbour had on average a larger input of DOM derived from wastewater treatment plant effluents. The seasonal patterns in the different optical characteristics of DOM in Lake Simcoe compared to other systems suggested that DOM qualitative transformations, be it through photooxidation or microbial degradation, are likely very important processes in this lake. The role of DOM in Lake Simcoe may have important ecological implications for the cycling of C and the oxygen regime of this lake.																	2044-2041						2013	3	2					139	152		10.5268/IW-3.2.535						WOS:000318267500003

The impact of four decades of annual nitrogen addition on dissolved organic matter in a boreal forest soil	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Addition of mineral nitrogen (N) can alter the concentration and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in forest soils. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term mineral N addition on soil solution concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in Strasan experimental forest (Norway spruce) in central Sweden. N was added yearly at two levels of intensity and duration: the N1 treatment represented a lower intensity but a longer duration (43 yr) of N addition than the shorter N2 treatment (24 yr). N additions were terminated in the N2 treatment in 1991. The N treatments began in 1967 when the spruce stands were 9 yr old. Soil solution in the forest floor O, and soil mineral B, horizons were sampled during the growing seasons of 1995 and 2009. Tension and non-tension lysimeters were installed in the O horizon (n = 6), and tension lysimeters were installed in the underlying B horizon (n = 4): soil solution was sampled at two-week intervals. Although tree growth and O horizon carbon (C) and N stock increased in treatments N1 and N2, the concentration of DOC in O horizon leachates was similar in both N treatments and control. This suggests an inhibitory direct effect of N addition on O horizon DOC. Elevated DON and nitrate in O horizon leachates in the ongoing N1 treatment indicated a move towards N saturation. In B horizon leachates, the N1 treatment approximately doubled leachate concentrations of DOC and DON. DON returned to control levels, but DOC remained elevated in B horizon leachates in N2 plots nineteen years after termination of N addition. We propose three possible explanations for the increased DOC in mineral soil: (i) the result of decomposition of a larger amount of root litter, either directly producing DOC or (ii) indirectly via priming of old SOM, and/or (iii) a suppression of extracellular oxidative enzymes.																	1726-4170						2013	10	3					1365	1377		10.5194/bg-10-1365-2013						WOS:000317010600010

High-field NMR spectroscopy and FTICR mass spectrometry: powerful discovery tools for the molecular level characterization of marine dissolved organic matter	BIOGEOSCIENCES												High-performance, non-target, high-resolution organic structural spectroscopy was applied to solid phase extracted marine dissolved organic matter (SPE-DOM) isolated from four different depths in the open South Atlantic Ocean off the Angola coast (3 degrees E, 18 degrees S; Angola Basin) and provided molecular level information with extraordinary coverage and resolution. Sampling was performed at depths of 5 m (Angola Current; near-surface photic zone), 48 m (Angola Current; fluorescence maximum), 200 m (still above Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW; upper mesopelagic zone) and 5446 m (North Atlantic Deep Water, NADW; abyssopelagic, similar to 30 m above seafloor) and produced SPE-DOM with near 40% carbon yield and beneficial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation properties, a crucial prerequisite for the acquisition of NMR spectra with excellent resolution. H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra of all four marine SPE-DOM showed smooth bulk envelopes, reflecting intrinsic averaging from massive signal overlap, with a few percent of visibly resolved signatures and variable abundances for all major chemical environments. The abundance of singly oxygenated aliphatics and acetate derivatives in H-1 NMR spectra declined from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM, whereas C-based aliphatics and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) increased in abundance. Surface SPE-DOM contained fewer methyl esters than all other samples, likely a consequence of direct exposure to sunlight. Integration of C-13 NMR spectra revealed continual increase of carboxylic acids and ketones from surface to depth, reflecting a progressive oxygenation, with concomitant decline of carbohydrate-related substructures. Aliphatic branching increased with depth, whereas the fraction of oxygenated aliphatics declined for methine, methylene and methyl carbon. Lipids in the oldest SPE-DOM at 5446 m showed a larger share of ethyl groups and methylene carbon than observed in the other samples. Two-dimensional NMR spectra showed exceptional resolution and depicted resolved molecular signatures in excess of a certain minimum abundance. Classical methyl groups terminating aliphatic chains represented similar to 15% of total methyl in all samples investigated. A noticeable fraction of methyl (similar to 2%) was bound to olefinic carbon. Methyl ethers were abundant in surface marine SPE-DOM, and the chemical diversity of carbohydrates was larger than that of freshwater and soil DOM. In all samples, we identified sp(2)-hybridized carbon chemical environments with discrimination of isolated and conjugated olefins and alpha,beta-unsaturated double bonds. Olefinic proton and carbon atoms were more abundant than aromatic ones; olefinic unsaturation in marine SPE-DOM will be more directly traceable to ultimate biogenic precursors than aromatic unsaturation. The abundance of furan, pyrrol and thiophene derivatives was marginal, whereas benzene derivatives, phenols and six-membered nitrogen heterocycles were prominent; a yet unassigned set of six-membered N-heterocycles with likely more than one single nitrogen occurred in all samples. Various key polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon substructures suggested the presence of thermogenic organic matter at all water depths. Progressive NMR cross-peak attenuation from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM was particularly strong in COSY NMR spectra and indicated a continual disappearance of biosignatures as well as entropy gain from an ever increased molecular diversity. Nevertheless, a specific near-seafloor SPE-DOM signature of unsaturated molecules recognized in both NMR and Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR/MS) possibly originated from sediment leaching. The conformity of key NMR and FTICR/MS signatures suggested the presence of a large set of identical molecules throughout the entire ocean column even though the investigated water masses belonged to different oceanic regimes and currents. FTICR/MS showed abundant CHO, CHNO, CHOS and CHNOS molecular series with slightly increasing numbers of mass peaks and average mass from surface to bottom SPE-DOM. The proportion of CHO and CHNO negative ions increased from surface to depth, whereas CHOS and especially CHNOS molecular series markedly declined. While certain rather aliphatic CHOS and CHNOS ions were observed solely in the surface, deep marine SPE-DOM was enriched in unique unsaturated and rather oxygenated CHO and CHNO molecular series. With the exception of abyssopelagic SPE-DOM at 5446 m, which showed a peculiar CHOS chemistry of unsaturated carbon and reduced sulphur (black sulphur), CHO and CHNO molecular series contributed similar to 87% to total positive electrospray ionization FTICR mass peak integral, with a near constant ratio of CHNO/CHO molecular compositions near 1.13 +/- 0.05. In case of all four marine SPE-DOM, remarkably disparate average elemental compositions as determined from either MS and NMR spectra were observed, caused by a pronounced ionization selectivity in electrospray ionization FTICR/MS. The study demonstrates that the exhaustive characterization of complex unknowns in marine DOM will enable a meaningful classification of individual marine biogeosignatures. Future in-depth functional biodiversity studies with a clear understanding of DOM structure and function might eventually lead to a novel, unified perception of biodiversity and biogeochemistry.

The Global Distribution and Dynamics of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 5	Annual Review of Marine Science											Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a ubiquitous component of the open ocean dissolved matter pool, and is important owing to its influence on the optical properties of the water column, its role in photochemistry and photobiology, and its utility as a tracer of deep ocean biogeochemical processes and circulation. In this review, we discuss the global distribution and dynamics of CDOM in the ocean, concentrating on developments in the past 10 years and restricting our discussion to open ocean and deep ocean (below the main thermocline) environments. CDOM has been demonstrated to exert primary control on ocean color by its absorption of light energy, which matches or exceeds that of phytoplankton pigments in most cases. This has important implications for assessing the ocean biosphere via ocean color-based remote sensing and the evaluation of ocean photochemical and photobiological processes. The general distribution of CDOM in the global ocean is controlled by a balance between production (primarily microbial remineralization of organic matter) and photolysis, with vertical ventilation circulation playing an important role in transporting CDOM to and from intermediate water masses. Significant decadal-scale fluctuations in the abundance of global surface ocean CDOM have been observed using remote sensing, indicating a potentially important role for CDOM in ocean-climate connections through its impact on photochemistry and photobiology.

Dissolved organic matter uptake in a temperate seagrass ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We assessed the utilization of inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds of different complexity by primary producers and bacteria in a seagrass ecosystem. Using double-labeled (C-13 and N-15) substrates, the net transfers from the dissolved nitrogen and carbon pools to phytoplankton, planktonic bacteria, epiphytes, seagrasses (Zostera noltii and Cymodocea nodosa), and a macroalga (Caulerpa prolifera) were quantified in field incubations. Phytoplankton was the largest nitrogen sink, followed by the epiphytic community. In contrast, carbon fixation was dominated by the macrophytes. Although compartment-specific variations existed, NH4+ was generally preferred over NO3- and urea. Specific uptake rates of individual amino acids were inversely related to their C:N ratio and their structural complexity (glycine > L-leucine > L-phenylalanine). In addition, biomarker-specific measurements (polar lipid-derived fatty acids and D-alanine) indicated increasing bacterial contributions to carbon uptake with increasing amino acid structural complexity. All primary producers acquired nitrogen from a complex pool of algae-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM), but algae-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was almost exclusively used by the planktonic compartment. In contrast, a similar complex pool of bacteria-derived DOM was not taken up in significant quantities by any of the primary producers. Our results illustrate that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) can provide bioavailable nitrogen to primary producers and bacteria in seagrass ecosystems on very short time-scales, and DON and DOC dynamics are largely uncoupled and must be investigated as 2 separate interacting pools.

Preliminary jar tests were conducted with four different additives (aluminum sulfate, FeCl3, FeSO4, and PACl) to observe the effects induced by changes in pH, alkalinity, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), and PO43-P of the permeate on the NWFF-aerobic reactor. The use of aluminum sulfate improved performance as it related to SCOD and phosphorus removal in the amounts of 2.1 mol aluminum sulfate/mol PO43-P. In the hybrid MBR, the average total phosphorus removal efficiency of the entire system was as high as 79% with continuous addition of 100 mg/L aluminum sulfate. Three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (F-EEM) spectroscopy of the liquid samples from the MBR indicated the presence of humic-like organic matter, which was regarded as primary aromatic organics.																	0021-9592						2013	46	2					127	133		10.1252/jcej.12we134						WOS:000315355300005

Geometry of Zn(II) complexes with dissolved organic matter: X-ray studies at variable pH	TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												The structure of Zn(II) complexes with dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important consideration in developing molecular-level models of Zn(II) speciation, but recent reports favoring the tetrahedral geometry differ from earlier findings that geometry was largely octahedral. In general, the presence of thiolate ligands favors the tetrahedral geometry, while O and N ligands favor the octahedral geometry. This work presents extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopic results, indicating an octahedral geometry over the pH range of 59 for a freshwater DOM isolate. Changes in XANES derivatives as a function of pH can be explained in terms of ligand protonation and/or changing ligand groups. Tetrahedral Zn(II)DOM geometry may be restricted to binding environments containing thiol groups.																	0277-2248					JAN 1	2013	95	1					38	44		10.1080/02772248.2012.734620						WOS:000315156400004

Estimating absorption coefficients of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) using a semi-analytical algorithm for southern Beaufort Sea waters: application to deriving concentrations of dissolved organic carbon from space	BIOGEOSCIENCES												A series of papers have suggested that freshwater discharge, including a large amount of dissolved organic matter (DOM), has increased since the middle of the 20th century. In this study, a semi-analytical algorithm for estimating light absorption coefficients of the colored fraction of DOM (CDOM) was developed for southern Beaufort Sea waters using remote sensing reflectance at six wavelengths in the visible spectral domain corresponding to MODIS ocean color sensor. This algorithm allows the separation of colored detrital matter (CDM) into CDOM and non-algal particles (NAP) through the determination of NAP absorption using an empirical relationship between NAP absorption and particle backscattering coefficients. Evaluation using independent datasets, which were not used for developing the algorithm, showed that CDOM absorption can be estimated accurately to within an uncertainty of 35% and 50% for oceanic and coastal waters, respectively. A previous paper (Matsuoka et al., 2012) showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were tightly correlated with CDOM absorption in our study area (r(2) = 0.97). By combining the CDOM absorption algorithm together with the DOC versus CDOM relationship, it is now possible to estimate DOC concentrations in the near-surface layer of the southern Beaufort Sea using satellite ocean color data. DOC concentrations in the sur-face waters were estimated using MODIS ocean color data, and the estimates showed reasonable values compared to in situ measurements. We propose a routine and near real-time method for deriving DOC concentrations from space, which may open the way to an estimate of DOC budgets for Arctic coastal waters.																	1726-4170						2013	10	2					917	927		10.5194/bg-10-917-2013						WOS:000315093000017

MCHO, and polysaccharides, PCHO) and total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA, including dissolved free, DFAA, and combined fraction, DCAA). The concentrations of DOC in the subsurface water ranged from 130.2 to 407.7 mu M C, with an average of 225.9 +/- 75.4 mu M C, while those in the surface microlayer varied between 140.1 and 330.9 mu M C, with an average of 217.8 +/- 56.8 mu M C. The concentrations of chlorophyll alpha, DOC, TDCHO and THAA in the microlayer were, respectively correlated with their subsurface water concentrations, implying that there was a strong exchange effect between the microlayer and subsurface water. The concentrations of DOC and TDCHO were negatively correlated with salinity, respectively, indicating that water mixing might play an important role in controlling the distribution of DOC and TDCHO in the water column. Major constituents of DCAA and DFAA present in the study area were glycine, alanine, glutamic acid, serine and histidine. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to examine the complex compositional differences that existed among the sampling sites. Our results showed that DFAA had higher mole percentages of glycine. valine and serine in the microlayer than in the subsurface water, while DCAA tended to have higher mole percentages of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, threonine, arginine, alanine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and leucine in the microlayer. The yields of TDCHO and THAA exhibited similar trends between the microlayer and subsurface water. Carbohydrate species displayed significant enrichment in the microlayer, whereas the DFAA and DCAA exhibited non-uniform enrichment in the microlayer. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bassandeh, M; Antony, A; Le-Clech, P; Richardson, D; Leslie, G				Bassandeh, Mojgan; Antony, Alice; Le-Clech, Pierre; Richardson, Desmond; Leslie, Greg			Evaluation of ion exchange resins for the removal of dissolved organic matter from biologically treated paper mill effluent	CHEMOSPHERE												In this study, the efficiency of six ion exchange resins to reduce the dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a biologically treated newsprint mill effluent was evaluated and the dominant removal mechanism of residual organics was established using advanced organic characterisations techniques. Among the resins screened, TAN1 possessed favourable Freundlich parameters, high resin capacity and solute affinity, closely followed by Marathon MSA and Marathon WBA. The removal efficiency of colour and lignin residuals was generally good for the anion exchange resins, greater than 50% and 75% respectively. In terms of the DOM fractions removal measured through liquid chromatography-organic carbon and nitrogen detector (LC-OCND), the resins mainly targeted the removal of humic and fulvic acids of molecular weight ranging between 500 and 1000 g mol(-1), the portion expected to contribute the most to the aromaticity of the effluent. For the anion exchange resins, physical adsorption operated along with ion exchange mechanism assisting to remove neutral and transphilic acid fractions of DOM. The column studies confirmed TAN1 being the best of those screened, exhibited the longest mass transfer zone and maximum treatable volume of effluent. The treatable effluent volume with 50% reduction in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was 4.8 L for TAN1 followed by Marathon MSA - 3.6 L, Marathon 11 - 2.0 L, 21K-XLT - 1.5 L and Marathon WBA - 1.2 L. The cation exchange resin G26 was not effective in DOM removal as the maximum DOC removal obtained was only 27%. The resin capacity could not be completely restored for any of the resins; however, a maximum restoration up to 74% and 93% was achieved for TAN1 and Marathon WBA resins. While this feasibility study indicates the potential option of using ion exchange resins for the reclamation of paper mill effluent, the need for improving the regeneration protocols to restore the resin efficiency is also identified. Similarly, care should be taken while employing LC-OCND for characterising resin-treated effluents, as the resin degradation is expected to contribute some organic carbon moieties misleading the actual performance of resin.

J	Wang, CK; Zhang, XJ; Wang, J; Chen, C				Wang, Chengkun; Zhang, Xiaojian; Wang, Jun; Chen, Chao			Characterization of dissolved organic matter as N-nitrosamine precursors based on hydrophobicity, molecular weight and fluorescence	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												It is very important to identify the dominant precursors for N-nitrosamine formation from bulk organic matter, to enhance the understanding of N-nitrosamine formation pathways in water treatment plants and allow the development of practical treatment technologies. In this study, dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two source waters was fractionated with XAD resins and ultrafiltration membranes. The N-nitrosamine formation potential (FP) (ng of N-nitrosamines formed per mg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) from raw water and each fraction were measured and correlated with the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM), molecular weight (MW) and other assays. The results showed that the hydrophilic fraction had N-nitrosamine FP 1.3 to 3.5 times higher than the hydrophobic fraction from both source waters. The DOM fraction with low MW was the dominant fraction in these two source waters and contributed more precursors for N-nitrosamine formation than the larger MW fraction. The HEM spectra indicated there were notable amounts of soluble microbial products (SMPs) and aromatic proteins in the two studied rivers, which probably originated from wastewater discharge. The SMPs tended to be more closely correlated with N-nitrosodimethylamine formation potential than the other DOM components. Higher N-nitrosamine FP were also related to fractions with lower DOC/DON ratios and lower SUVA(254) values.

With the increase of gallic acid concentration from 0 to 400 mg/L, the adsorption amount of nitrate-nitrogen on the commercial resins, including D201, Purolite A 300 (A300) and Purolite A 520E (A520E), would significantly decrease. However, the presence of tannin acid has little impact on nitrate-nitrogen adsorption on them. Compared to D201 and A300 resins, A520E resin exhibited more preferable adsorption ability toward nitrate-nitrogen in the presence of competing organic molecules, such as gallic acid and tannin acid at greater levels in aqueous solution. Attractively, the equilibrium data showed that the adsorption isotherm of nitrate-nitrogen on A520E resin was in good agreement with Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The rate parameters for the intra particle diffusion have been estimated for the different initial concentrations. In batch adsorption processes, nitrate-nitrogen diffuse in porous adsorbent and rate process usually depends on t(1/2) rather than the contact time. The pseudo first- and the second-order kinetic models fit better for nitrate-nitrogen adsorption onto A520E resin. The observations reported herein illustrated that A520E resin will be an excellent adsorbent for enhanced removal of nitrate-nitrogen from contaminated groundwater.																	1001-0742	1878-7320				JAN 1	2013	25	1					105	113		10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60035-7						WOS:000314427700013	23586305	
J	Seto, M; Wada, S; Suzuki, S				Seto, Mayumi; Wada, Shigeki; Suzuki, Satoru			The effect of zinc on aquatic microbial ecosystems and the degradation of dissolved organic matter	CHEMOSPHERE												We developed a simple aquatic microbial ecosystem model in order to examine potential effects of zinc on microorganisms and the related degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The model is a combination of both a traditional food chain and a microbial loop. The traditional food chain is mainly composed of phytoplankton and zooplankton, whilst the microbial loop is composed of DOM, bacteria and bacterivorous protozoa. We incorporated the suppressive effect of zinc on the bacterial uptake of DOM and assessed the steady state responses of the model for various zinc concentrations. The analytical and numerical results of the model implied that either zooplankton or bacterivorous protozoa might be the most vulnerable group to excessive zinc load than bacteria, depending on the grazing preference of zooplankton between phytoplankton and bacterivorous protozoa.

Results showed the efficient removal of color and fluorescence compounds were achieved through ozonation, due to increasing hydrophilicity and lowering molecular weight of DOM. A significant biodegradability improvement was also observed, and DOM adsorbability on activated carbon was highly dependent on ozone dosage. As the key parameter, consumed 3.8 g O3/?g TOC0 was the optimal dosage in the hybrid process combining ozonation with biological activated carbon (BAC) for wastewater reclamation.																	0191-9512					JAN 1	2013	35	1					7	15		10.1080/01919512.2013.720211						WOS:000314158400004

DOM dynamics during a summer storm event in June, 2011 were examined in a subtropical river (the North Jiulong River, China). Stormwater runoff was sampled for measurement of dissolved organic C (DOC), absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs). Three different fluorescent components were identified using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), including humic-like C1 and C3, and C2 as a combination of humic-like and protein-like fluorophores. The flux of DOC increased fivefold from 0.4 kg s(-1) at baseflow to 2.0 kg s(-1) at peak flow. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and fluorescent components also showed large increases with stormflow. The flux of DOC was similar during the rising and falling hydrographs at equal water discharge, while those of CDOM and fluorescent components were much higher during the falling-hydrograph. Carbon specific CDOM absorption coefficient at UV (SUVA(254)) and the fraction of C3 which fluoresced at long emission wavelength correlated positively to each other but negatively to absorption spectral slope ratio (S-R) and C2%. They showed notable temporal variations indicative of increases in aromaticity, C3% and average molecular weight of DOM during the storm event. Changes in DOM composition lagged behind those in DOM flux. Changes in the flux and quality of DOM during the storm event, which were monitored effectively by absorption spectroscopy and EEMs-PARAFAC, could affect biogeochemical processes in the river and receiving coastal waters.

It has been known that various fractions of DOM differed in their chemical and biogeochemical behaviors in environment. However, there has been relatively little work directed at predicting the dependence of redox properties of DOM on its fractions. DOM was extracted from sewage sludge compost. Freeze-dried DOM was grouped into three fractions of different molecular sizes (< 3,500, 3,500-14,000, and > 14,000 Da) using dialysis bags (Spectra/Por 3 and 4, Spectrum Industries, California, US). Cycle voltammetry was used to investigate the redox behavior of the fractions. Chronoamperometry was employed to study their electron accepting capacities and electron donating capacities by applying fixed positive or negative potential to the working electrode in a conventional three-electrode cell. Fourier-transform infrared and three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopies were used to determine the functional groups in the fractions. Shewanella putrefaciens 200 (SP200) and Klebsiella pneumoniae L17 (L17) were used for all microbial iron(III) reduction experiments. Electrochemical methods show that the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of DOM depends on its molecular weight, and ETC is in the order of high-molecular weight DOM (H-DOM) > moderate-molecular weight DOM > low-molecular weight DOM. The same trend is discovered in the DOM-stimulated iron(III) oxide bioreduction where DOM fractions act as electron shuttles transferring electrons from the Fe(III)-reducing bacteria to the iron oxide. Both spectroscopic and cyclic voltammogram assays show the highest abundance of redox moieties associated to H-DOM, which is possibly responsible for its strongest electron-shuttling ability. DOM has a wide molecular weight (MW) distribution due to the complexity of its chemical composition and structure. In addition to structural variations, DOM fractions with different MW have different redox properties and electron-shuttling capacities in microbial Fe(III) reduction. The results are of great significance for further studies on DOM geochemical behavior in environment.				yuan, yong/B-1042-2010													1439-0108					JAN	2013	13	1					56	63		10.1007/s11368-012-0585-y						WOS:000313411500006

This article focuses on the photolysis kinetics and mechanism of sunscreen agent p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the presence of four kinds of DOM; Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA), Nordic Lake fulvic acid (NOFA) and Nordic Lake humic acid (NOHA). It is evident that direct photolysis of PABA is highly pH-dependent because different species of PABA have different electrical densities on the ring system. The presence of four kinds of DOM inhibits the photolysis of PABA primarily due to their light screening effect. Meanwhile, a complex interaction involving energy transfer, triplet carbonyl group induced electron transfer, and amino acid induced proton abstraction between PABA and DOM is verified by competition kinetics experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computation. In addition, DOM-induced singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) are determined to play an insignificant role in PABA photolysis by competition dynamics method. Photoproducts identification using solid phase extraction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) techniques reveals that the distribution of the photoproducts could not be affected by the addition of DOM. Two photodegradation pathways of PABA are temporarily proposed, in which the di(tri)-polymerization of intermediates are the dominant pathway whereas the oxidation of amino group to nitryl followed by hydroxylation is a minor process. Our findings reveal that direct photolysis is the dominant transformation pathway of PABA in natural sunlit waters, while the presence of DOM could evidently influence such process by light screening effect, energy transfer, electron transfer and proton abstraction mechanism. The findings in this study provide useful information for understanding of interaction between DOM and organic contaminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nebbioso, A; Piccolo, A				Nebbioso, Antonio; Piccolo, Alessandro			Molecular characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM): a critical review	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Advances in water chemistry in the last decade have improved our knowledge about the genesis, composition, and structure of dissolved organic matter, and its effect on the environment. Improvements in analytical technology, for example Fourier-transform ion cyclotron (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS), homo and hetero-correlated multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and excitation emission matrix fluorimetry (EEMF) with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis for UV-fluorescence spectroscopy have resulted in these advances. Improved purification methods, for example ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, have enabled facile desalting and concentration of freshly collected DOM samples, thereby complementing the analytical process. Although its molecular weight (MW) remains undefined, DOM is described as a complex mixture of low-MW substances and larger-MW biomolecules, for example proteins, polysaccharides, and exocellular macromolecules. There is a general consensus that marine DOM originates from terrestrial and marine sources. A combination of diagenetic and microbial processes contributes to its origin, resulting in refractory organic matter which acts as carbon sink in the ocean. Ocean DOM is derived partially from humified products of plants decay dissolved in fresh water and transported to the ocean, and partially from proteinaceous and polysaccharide material from phytoplankton metabolism, which undergoes in-situ microbial processes, becoming refractory. Some of the DOM interacts with radiation and is, therefore, defined as chromophoric DOM (CDOM). CDOM is classified as terrestrial, marine, anthropogenic, or mixed, depending on its origin. Terrestrial CDOM reaches the oceans via estuaries, whereas autochthonous CDOM is formed in sea water by microbial activity; anthropogenic CDOM is a result of human activity. CDOM also affects the quality of water, by shielding it from solar radiation, and constitutes a carbon sink pool. Evidence in support of the hypothesis that part of marine DOM is of terrestrial origin, being the result of a long-term carbon sedimentation, has been obtained from several studies discussed herein.																	1618-2642					JAN	2013	405	1					109	124		10.1007/s00216-012-6363-2						WOS:000313064000014	22965531

Binding interactions of algal-derived dissolved organic matter with metal ions	CHEMOSPHERE												The nature and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influences its binding properties to heavy metals and thus their fate, mobility and toxicity in aquatic environments. Fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize DOM exuded by the cosmopolitan freshwater green algae Scenedesmus acutus during early exponential growth phase. One protein-like (peak T; C2) and two humic-like components (peaks A + C and A + M, Cl and C3, respectively) were split half validated on 122 emission-excitation matrices (EEMs). Our data show that both humic-like could be associated with biological activities. Unlike Cd, Pb and Zn, Cu strongly binds to algogenic DOM with conditional stability constants (logK) averaging 5.26 +/- 0.29 (from 4.85 to 5.36). Significant differences in logK values were found between humic-like PARAFAC components, indicating clear differences in the binding properties of humic-like components with copper.

J	Drastik, M; Novak, F; Kucerik, J				Drastik, Martin; Novak, Frantisek; Kucerik, Jiri			Origin of heat-induced structural changes in dissolved organic matter	CHEMOSPHERE												Humic substances play an important role in many environmental processes such as sequestration and transport of hydrophobic compounds. The supramolecular character of humic substances imparts high flexibility of the aggregates associated with their variable reactivity under different conditions. In this study, heat-induced transitions and character of the hydration shell of sodium salts of humic and fulvic acids originating from various sources were investigated using ultrasonic velocimetry in the temperature interval from 5 to 90 degrees C. Results clearly showed differences in stability and characteristics of the hydrated states at concentrations above and below 1 g L-1 with the exception of Pahokee peat fulvic acids. It has been concluded that predominantly the relaxation part of the adiabatic compressibility plays an important role below 1 g L-1 in contrast to both relaxation and intrinsic parts of the compressibility being important at higher concentrations. Dilution brought several temperature induced transitions which were investigated with respect to composition of all investigated humic substances. Correlation analysis revealed that the transition around 17 degrees C is associated with disruption of H-interactions whereas the transition around 42 degrees C depends on the aromaticity. Comparison of cooling and heating records revealed hysteresis in the structural relaxation resembling the behavior of physically stabilized hydrogels. Results indicated a difference in the conformation and therefore reactivity of dissolved humic substances in the dependence on temperature and thermal history. It has been hypothesized that this may play an important role in the transport and sequestration of hydrophobic pollutants by dissolved organic matter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seasonal and air mass trajectory effects on dissolved organic matter of bulk deposition at a coastal town in south-western Europe	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Rainwater contains a complex mixture of organic compounds which may influence climate, terrestrial and maritime ecosystems and thus human health. In this work, the characteristics of DOM of bulk deposition at a coastal town on the southwest of Europe were assessed by UV-visible and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopies and by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. The seasonal and air mass trajectory effects on dissolved organic matter (DOM) of bulk deposition were evaluated. The absorbance at 250 nm (UV250nm) and integrated fluorescence showed to be positively correlated with each other, and they were also positively correlated to the DOC in bulk deposition, which suggest that a constant fraction of DOM is likely to fluoresce. There was more chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) present in summer and autumn seasons than in winter and spring. Bulk deposition associated with terrestrial air masses contained a higher CDOM content than bulk deposition related to marine air masses, thus highlighting the contribution of terrestrial/anthropogenic sources.

J	Dong, Q; Shang, SL; Lee, Z				Dong, Qiang; Shang, Shaoling; Lee, Zhongping			An algorithm to retrieve absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from ocean color	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We extended the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) architecture to analytically derive absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(g)). Specifically, we used an empirical formula based on total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients to estimate and then remove detritus absorption coefficient (a(d)), and developed a scheme to use absorption coefficients at three wavelengths (412,443, and 490 nm) for the separation of a(g) and a(ph) (absorption coefficient of phytoplankton). The algorithm was tested using an in situ data set collected in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and a global in situ data set the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD). Our results indicated that this new analytical algorithm for retrieving a(g) performed reasonably well with a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 45% for a(g)(412), while it also presented a satisfactory performance for a(ph) and a(d) in both coastal and oceanic waters. Furthermore, the applicability of this new algorithm for general oceanographic studies was briefly illustrated by applying it to MODIS measurements over the Taiwan Strait and the shelf region near the Mississippi River delta. Nevertheless, more independent tests with in situ and satellite data are needed to further validate and improve this innovative approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the removal rate of E2 and the affinity of HRP to E2 had been significantly decreased in the presence of DOM. Compared with urban sludge DOM (USDOM), river sediment DOM (RSDOM), which features relatively low aromaticity and molecular weight and a large number of O-containing groups, more strongly inhibited the E2-HRP-H2O2 reactions than USDOM. The products were analyzed with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The results suggested that the self-coupling of E2 was suppressed in the presence of DOM, likely resulting from cross-coupling between DOM and E2 or self-coupling of DOM in the HRP system. The results are useful in understanding the fate of estrogens in natural systems.																	0049-6979					JAN	2013	224	1							1359	10.1007/s11270-012-1359-2						WOS:000313012500005		
J	Keller, DP; Hood, RR				Keller, David P.; Hood, Raleigh R.			Comparative simulations of dissolved organic matter cycling in idealized oceanic, coastal, and estuarine surface waters	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												In this paper we used a steady-state ecosystem model that simulates both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) cycling to study how the planktonic community structure, nutrient availability, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) loading affect these cycles in idealized oceanic, coastal, and estuarine surface waters. The model was able to reproduce DOM and planktonic biomass distributions, uptake rates, and production rates (including DOM) that fell within ranges reported for oceanic, coastal, and estuarine systems. Using a sensitivity analysis we show that DOM cycling was intricately tied to the biomass concentration, distribution, and productivity of plankton. The efficiency of nutrient remineralization and the availability of inflowing nutrients and DON also played a large role in DOM cycling. In these simulations the largest autochthonous source of DOC was always phytoplankton exudation while important sources of DON varied considerably. In the oceanic simulations heterotrophic bacteria were particularly important for mediating DOM cycling because they were the primary agents that controlled nutrient recycling and supply (i.e., strong bottom-up control). In contrast, in the estuarine simulations mortality (mainly from grazing and viral lysis) had the most influence on DOM production. However, DOM cycling was generally less dependent on interactions between plankton in the estuarine case because of high nutrient and DOM loading. The coastal simulations were somewhere in between. In all simulations competition between different size classes of phytoplankton also played an important role in DOM cycling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inefficient monitoring and control of the conventional water treatment process may induce a negative impact on the final quality of the plant output and a significant increase in operating costs. In this work, we studied the optimum coagulation conditions to minimize the DOM. The use of powder activated carbon, after chlorination, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation has reduced humic substances (HS) competition by selective elimination, which increasing its effectiveness in other micro-pollutants elimination (chlorinated by-products, pesticides ...). The quantitative reduction of the DOM was made by chemical oxygen demand (micro COD), UV254, and also qualitative: by fractionation of dissolved organic matter on macroporous resins XAD-7HP and XAD-4, we can estimate the removal rate of humic substance by simple comparison between the treated samples and raw water fractions. Treatment trials were carried out by jar-tester. The trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP) were analyzed by LLE-GC-ECD which give 192 mu g-THM / L (higher than USEPA standards). Increasing the regular dose of coagulant 30mg / L to 50mg / L and decreasing pH from 8.01 to 6.50 was used to increase the removal rate of DOC from 17.5 to 27.5%. The combination of powder activated carbon after this step will further improve the removal rate of organic matter to 88.5% of DOC and 98% UV254.In addition, the THMFP was reduced from 192 to 20 mu g-THM/L, a simple combination of conventional treatment with powder activated carbon, but in different conditions to that practiced by the country water treatment company (ADE: Algerienne Des Eaux). In ordinary conditions of chlorination treatment (residual chlorine 0.6 mg-Cl-2/L), the concentration of THMs formed after 03 incubation days did not exceed 6 mu g-THM / L.																	1106-5516		978-960-7475-51-0				2013																WOS:000346067900369

W.; Pavlov, Alexey K.; de Steur, Laura; Hansen, Edmond			Characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Arctic outflow in the Fram Strait: Assessing the changes and fate of terrigenous CDOM in the Arctic Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Absorption coefficients of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured together with salinity, delta O-18, and inorganic nutrients across the Fram Strait. A pronounced CDOM absorption maximum between 30 and 120 m depth was associated with river and sea ice brine enriched water, characteristic of the Arctic mixed layer and upper halocline waters in the East Greenland Current (EGC). The lowest CDOM concentrations were found in the Atlantic inflow. We show that the salinity-CDOM relationship is not suitable for evaluating conservative mixing of CDOM. The strong correlation between meteoric water and CDOM is indicative of the riverine/terrigenous origin of CDOM in the EGC. Based on CDOM absorption in Polar Water and comparison with an Arctic river discharge weighted mean, we estimate that a 49-59% integrated loss of CDOM absorption across 250-600 nm has occurred. A preferential removal of absorption at longer wavelengths reflects the loss of high molecular weight material. In contrast, CDOM fluxes through the Fram Strait using September velocity fields from a high-resolution ocean-sea ice model indicate that the net southward transport of terrigenous CDOM through the Fram Strait equals up to 50% of the total riverine CDOM input; this suggests that the Fram Strait export is a major sink of CDOM. These contrasting results indicate that we have to constrain the (C)DOM budgets for the Arctic Ocean much better and examine uncertainties related to using tracers to assess conservative mixing in polar waters.

Characteristics of dissolved organic matter in the inflows and in the outflow of Lake Vortsjarv, Estonia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												UV-Vis spectroscopy was applied to characterize the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the inflows and in the outflow of the large and shallow temperate Lake Vortsjarv and to determine its temporal and spatial dynamics in 2008-2010. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was influenced by water temperature, precipitation, stream gradient, discharge, and percentage of peatland in the catchment area and its mean annual values by rivers varied from 9.2 to 27.7 mg L-1. Higher DOC values in the outflow in summer/autumn corresponded to periods of intensive phytoplankton development whereas lower values were observed in winter or early spring when biological processes are at a standstill. The results of specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) and 285 nm (SUVA(285)) showed domination of fulvic acids in the rivers. According to our spectroscopic results, the aromaticity of DOM increased with the increasing percentage of peatland and forest and with the decreasing percentage of arable land in the river catchments.

The nature of colored dissolved organic matter in the southern Canada Basin and East Siberian Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Distributions of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the upper 400 m of the southern Canada Basin and East Siberian Sea were determined using an in situ WETStar fluorometer and fluorescence spectroscopy during cruises in 2008 as part of the Canada/US Joint Ocean Ice Study and Japan's International Polar Year program. Despite the low CDOM range (0.009-0.069 r.u.) observed in the upper 400 m of the study area, our results show that CDOM can be quantified from in situ DOM fluorescence sensor measurements. Unlike DOC concentrations, which are known to decrease with increasing depth, a pronounced mid-depth CDOM maximum was associated with the Pacific-derived winter water throughout our study area. Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to resolve dominant fluorophore components in fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEM), we identified three humic-like and two proteinaceous components. The nature and origin of these five fluorophores were investigated based on their fluorescent characteristics as well as their vertical and geographical distributions. The lowest terrestrial humic-like signals in the surface waters were mostly due to photochemical processes, whereas the highest microbial/marine humic-like signal revealed interactions with sediment during the formation of Pacific-origin haloclines over the Arctic shelves. The humic-like fluorophores dominated DOM fluorescence in the Westernmost region in the East Siberian Sea whereas the contribution of protein-like fluorophores was predominant elsewhere. The significant difference in CDOM composition between East and West of the 180 degrees meridian suggests the presence of a front that divides our study area into the Eastern Chukchi-Beaufort and East Siberian sides. This indicates a change in water circulation, and that more than one DOM source affects our study area. Unlike proteinaceous material, the humic-like compounds varied significantly in the halocline. Ten to 20 percent enrichment was observed in terrestrially-derived DOM in the two Pacific-derived haloclines relative to the Atlantic-derived lower halocline. The application of PARAFAC modeling on fluorescent DOM is shown to be an important tool to investigate the dynamics and transport of allochthonous DOM in the Arctic Ocean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It was shown that high shear forces resulted in a breakage of Fe-DOM flocs. Re-growth took place during subsequent low shear phases. However, re-growth was limited. The flocs regained a size of about 50% of the size after initial coagulation. Cyclic shearing resulted in slower re-growth rates. A new insight was that when enough time was given, similar sizes of the re-grown flocs were regained. As shown by bulk DOC, only an insignificant release of DOM took place when flocs were exposed to shear. Increase in shear stress resulted in smaller flocs with higher specific outer surface area. However, DOM removal did not change. Thus, there was no increase in adsorption capacity due to floc breakage. Consequently, DOM must be adsorbed inside the amorphous flocs rather than on the outer surface. Also, as shear results in more compact flocs, compaction does not have an effect on DOM removal. A pH increase of 0.5, as it can happen during water treatment after coagulation, resulted in a release of DOM. Humic substances accounted for the largest proportion of total DOM released. The increase in pH did not affect floc size. Consequently, DOM removal is mainly governed by the dependence of DOM properties on pH with the final pH determining the degree of DOM removal and not the path on which this pH is reached. The physical properties of the flocs have no impact on DOM removal. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PARAFAC aids the characterization of fluorescence CDOM by decomposing the fluorescence matrices into individual components. Four humic-like components (C1, C2, C3, and C4), one marine biological production component (C6), and two protein-like components (C5 and C7) were identified by PARAFAC. We researched the distributional patterns of fluorescence intensity, regression analyses between salinity, chlorophyll a concentration and fluorescence intensities of individual fluorophore, and regression analysis between salinity and fluorescence intensities percent of individual fluorophore. The results revealed that C2 and C4 showed conservative mixing behavior, while C1 and C3 possessed conservative mixing behavior in high salinity region and additional behavior in low and middle salinity region, which were considered to be derived from riverine and degradation of organic matter from resuspended and/or sinking particles and show non-conservative mixing behavior. In addition to riverine sources, the tryptophan-like C5 may receive widespread addition (likely from photo-degradation or biodegradation), while the most likely sources for the one marine humic-like C6 and tyrosine-like C7 were biological activity and microbial processing of plankton-derived CDOM, which were suggested to be of autochthonous origin and biologically labile. The application of EEM-PARAFAC modeling presents a unique opportunity to observe compositional changes, different mixing behavior and temporal variability in CDOM in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea.																	1674-7291	1869-1870				DEC	2012	55	12					2595	2609		10.1007/s11426-012-4617-7						WOS:000312531300017

The Photodegradation of Ibuprofen and Dissolved Organic Matter in Lake Superior and St. Louis River Water	ZEBRAFISH												Ibuprofen can enter bodies of water via waste water treatment. The question was what effect does photodegradation have on ibuprofen and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Lake Superior (oligiotrophic) and St. Louis (tannic stained) River water? Ibuprofen concentrations of 15,000, 30,000, and 60,000 mu g/L were made from lake, river, and distilled water, as well as additional distilled concentrations of 7,500 and 120,000 mu g/L. Half of the eighty-four trial cups were placed in an ultraviolet light cabinet and half of the set were placed in a dark cabinet for three days. After the exposure period, a UV-Vis was performed to measure change in molar mass and the summed absorbance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). It appears that ibuprofen decreases in molar mass after exposure to light in distilled and lake water with 15,000 mu g/L of ibuprofen. Surprisingly, the molar mass of DOM in river water increases after UV exposure. Possibly, this occurred because the river water has such a high molar mass of DOM and was not filtered. Microbial biomass could also have contributed to this increase. Ibuprofen entering bodies of water via the waste water treatment system appears to be affected by UV light exposure, but in different ways.																	1545-8547					DEC	2012	9	4					179	184		10.1089/zeb.2012.0754						WOS:000312582100004	23244688

DOM in the secondary effluent from the North Wastewater Treatment Plant (Shenyang, China) was fractionated using XAD resins into 5 fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). Results showed that fluorescent materials in HPO-N and TPI-N were less readily removed than those in the other fractions by GACA. The relative content of fluorescent materials in HPO-A, TPI-A and HPI decreased whereas that in HPO-N and TPI-N increased as a consequence of GACA. Polycyclic aromatics in all DOM fractions were preferentially absorbed by GACA, in comparison with bulk DOM expressed as DOC. On the other hand, the adsorption of aromatic amino acids and humic acid-like fluorophores exhibiting fluorescence peaks in synchronous spectra by GACA seemed to be dependent on the acid/neutral properties of DOM fractions. All five fractions had decreased fluorescence indices as a result of GACA. GACA led to a decreased lambda (0.5) value for HPO-A, increased lambda (0.5) values for HPO-N, TPI-A and HPI, and a consistent lambda (0.5) value for TPI-N.																	2095-2201					DEC	2012	6	6					784	796		10.1007/s11783-012-0436-5						WOS:000311498800004

Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra and parallel factor analysis were employed to characterize the composition, and fluorescence quenching titration technique was applied to study the complexation between Hg (II) and HON, HOA, and HIM fractions. Protein-like substances, humic-like compounds and xenobiotic organic matters (XOM) were identified in all fractions. The HOA, HOB and HON fractions comprised mainly XOM, while the HIM fraction consisted primarily of humic-like compounds. The complexation ability of protein-like substances was higher than that of humic-like compounds. The complexation ability of the HIM was highest for protein-like substances, while the complexation ability of the HON fraction was the highest for humic-like substances. The results suggested that the toxicity and bioavailability of the mercury in the young leachates was the highest, and decreased with landfill time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The spectroscopic characteristics of these fractions were determined through constant-wavelength synchronous fluorescence spectrometry (CWSFS). The interaction characteristic of phenanthrene with these fractions was determined through the fluorescence quenching method and CWSFS. The results revealed that the composition of DOM became complex with the increase in landfill age. The partition coefficients (K (doc)) for the three DOM samples of different landfill ages are in the order 10 a DOM > 5 a DOM > 0 a DOM. The hydrophobic fraction showed the highest K (doc) value among the DOM fractions. Lower linearity Stern-Volmer plots were observed in 10 a DOM and its hydrophobic fractions. CWSFS spectra showed that a special site was fully occupied with the addition of the quencher. Desorption was found in some fractions. Therefore, CWSFS is a sensitive tool for the detection of DOM-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon interaction.																	1866-6280					DEC	2012	67	7					1861	1867		10.1007/s12665-012-1628-9						WOS:000310994500001

Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter in Full Scale Continuous Stirred Tank Biogas Reactors Using Ultrahigh Resolution Mass Spectrometry: A Qualitative Overview	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was characterized in eight full scale continuous stirred tank biogas reactors (CSTBR) using solid-phase extraction and electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). An overview of the DOM molecular complexity in the samples from biogas reactors with conventional operational conditions and various substrate profiles is provided by assignments of unambiguous exact molecular formulas for each measured mass peak. Analysis of triplicate samples for each reactor demonstrated the reproducibility of the solid-phase extraction procedure and ESI-FT-ICR-MS which allowed precise evaluation of the DOM molecular differences among the different reactors. Cluster analysis on mass spectrometric data set showed that the biogas reactors treating sewage sludge had distinctly different DOM characteristics compared to the codigesters treating a combination of organic wastes. Furthermore, the samples from thermophilic and mesophilic codigesters had different DOM composition in terms of identified masses and corresponding intensities. Despite the differences, the results demonstrated that compositionally linked organic compounds comprising 28-59% of the total number of assigned formulas for the samples were shared in all the reactors. This suggested that the shared assigned formulas in studied CSTBRs might be related to common biochemical transformation in anaerobic digestion process and therefore, performance of the CSTBRs.

Dissolved organic matter composition of winter flow in the Yukon River basin: Implications of permafrost thaw and increased groundwater discharge	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Groundwater discharge to rivers has increased in recent decades across the circumpolar region and has been attributed to thawing permafrost in arctic and subarctic watersheds. Permafrost-driven changes in groundwater discharge will alter the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers, yet little is known about the chemical composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of groundwater in permafrost settings. Here, we characterize DOM composition of winter flow in 60 rivers and streams of the Yukon River basin to evaluate the biogeochemical consequences of enhanced groundwater discharge associated with permafrost thaw. DOC concentration of winter flow averaged 3.9 +/- 0.5mg C L-1, yet was highly variable across basins (ranging from <1 to >20 mg C L-1). In comparison to the summer-autumn period, DOM composition of winter flow had lower aromaticity (as indicated by specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, or SUVA(254)), lower hydrophobic acid content, and a higher proportion of hydrophilic compounds (HPI). Fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis indicated enrichment of protein-like fluorophores in some, but not all, winter flow samples. The ratio of DOC to dissolved organic nitrogen, an indicator of DOM biodegradability, was positively correlated with SUVA(254) and negatively correlated with the percentage of protein-like compounds. Using a simple two-pool mixing model, we evaluate possible changes in DOM during the summer-autumn period across a range of conditions reflecting possible increases in groundwater discharge. Across three watersheds, we consistently observed decreases in DOC concentration and SUVA(254) and increases in HPI with increasing groundwater discharge. Spatial patterns in DOM composition of winter flow appear to reflect differences in the relative contributions of groundwater from suprapermafrost and subpermafrost aquifers across watersheds. Our findings call for more explicit consideration of DOC loss and stabilization pathways associated with changing subsurface hydrology in watersheds underlain by thawing permafrost.																	0886-6236	1944-9224				NOV 17	2012	26								GB0E06	10.1029/2012GB004341						WOS:000311246700002

Free and combined amino acids are bioavailable constituents of DOM, and their concentration and composition can provide valuable information about the diagenetic state of DOM. Based on riparian groundwater samples and relevant DOM end-member samples, we adapted the amino-acid-based marine DOM degradation index (DI) to groundwater. The groundwater DI was applied to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability in the bioavailability and diagenetic state of riparian DOM in a restored and a channelized section of the River Thur, Switzerland. Among different indicators for DOM diagenetic state (total hydrolysable amino acid concentrations, C-normalized yields, and the contribution of nonprotein amino acids), the groundwater DI correlated best with the activity of the enzyme leucine-aminopeptidase and bacterial secondary production in riparian groundwater. The "freshest" DOM was consistently found in the channel and during high-flow conditions in the groundwater of the restored riparian section and was spatially constrained to a zone inhabited by a dense willow population. The use of amino acid data and the newly developed DI for DOM in groundwater is a promising approach for characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of DOM reactivity and diagenesis within riparian groundwater.

J	Haham, H; Oren, A; Chefetz, B				Haham, Hai; Oren, Adi; Chefetz, Benny			Insight into the Role of Dissolved Organic Matter in Sorption of Sulfapyridine by Semiarid Soils	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sorption-desorption behavior of sulfapyridine was studied with three distinct soil types low in organic carbon with or without the introduction of exogenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). Experiments with bulk soils yielded sorption coefficients equivalent to those obtained with soils richer in organic matter, indicating an important sorptive role for soil mineral matrices. Cointroduction of sulfapyridine with DOM significantly reduced sulfapyridine sorption. However, decreasing solution pH from similar to 9 to similar to 6 limited the effect of DOM and revealed the effect of ionic speciation of sulfapyridine on the sorption potential. Sulfapyridine sorption to soils precoated with DOM exhibited contrasting trends. Two of the coated soils exhibited decreased sorption of sulfapyridine probably due to blockage of sorption sites by DOM. Conversely, the third soil demonstrated cumulative adsorption of sulfapyridine. Precoating also enhanced sulfapyridine desorption, suggesting that sorption of sulfapyridine to mineral surfaces involves stronger chemisorptive binding as compared with interactions with sorbed DOM. The capacity of soil to sorb DOM as well as the chemical fractionation of DOM during sorption were found to significantly affect binding of sulfapyridine. Competition between preferentially sorbed DOM moieties (e.g., carboxyl, phenol) and sulfapyridine for sorption sites is proposed. This study suggests that the chemical nature of DOM can significantly affect the fate of sulfonamide compounds in soils.																	0013-936X					NOV 6	2012	46	21					11870	11877		10.1021/es303189f						WOS:000310665000047	23020667

The results showed that fluorescence spectroscopy of hydrophobic acids ( HOA), hydrophobic bases (HOB), hydrophobic neutral traction (HIB), hydrophobic neutral fraction (HON) and hydrophilic neutral fraction (HIN) changed considerably, and that of HIA was relatively steady during photocatalytic process. In general, fluorescence peaks of humic acids-like had the most significant change during photocatalytic treatment process, and disappeared entirely after 60 h treatment, which implied that humic acids-like can be degraded preferentially. In 72 h effluent, VIS fulvic-like, tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like were residual in the fluorescence regions, and the last two were predominant fractions. These results indicated that macromolecular fulvic-like and humic acids-like can be degraded into micro-molecular protein-like matters.																	0253-3820					NOV	2012	40	11					1740	1746		10.3724/SP.J.1096.2012.20409						WOS:000313832800016

Recent studies suggest that its amount and composition in freshwaters may be altered by agricultural land use, whereby the influence of preceding in-stream production and processing is not clear. To assess the land use effect on DOM amount and composition for the export from terrestrial to freshwater systems at the land-water interface, we sampled headwater streams draining agricultural and near-pristine catchments (forested and wetland) in the North German plains. To account for spatial and seasonal variation, we conducted a screening of DOM amount (53 sites) and composition (42 sites), and conducted bi-weekly samplings to investigate seasonal variation at eight sites over one year. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were significantly higher for agricultural and wetland catchments than for forested catchments. Moreover, DOC loads exhibited higher seasonal variation for agricultural and wetland catchments than for forested catchments, which was due to higher variation in discharge. Parallel Factor Analysis revealed that the composition of DOM in agricultural catchments was significantly different from the other studied catchment types, and was characterized by low redox state and high structural complexity. Moreover, a gradient from protein- to humic-like fluorescence significantly separated forested from agricultural and wetland catchments. The contribution of humic-like DOM was strongly and positively related to DOC concentration, suggesting a mechanistic coupling of both. The effects of land use on patterns of DOC concentration and DOM composition were consistent across seasons, implying that land use strongly regulates DOM export. Overall, this study clearly shows the seasonally independent importance of agricultural land use for the amount and composition of DOM fluxes from the terrestrial zone to surface waters. These altered fluxes may affect ecosystem metabolism and health of agricultural headwaters and downstream situated aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Batch sorption data revealed a positive effect of soil metal oxide content on sorption affinity and capacity for DOM. In contrast, the role of soil texture in DOM sorption could not be substantiated. The alkalinity of the investigated soils did not seem to reduce their DOM sorption capabilities relative to less alkaline soils having comparable Fe-oxide contents. Our data obtained from sequential cycles of sorption showed similar behaviors suggesting that DOM sorption capacity was not affected by the sorbed DOM. Desorption isotherms revealed highly hysteretic behavior of DOM, with up to 83% of the sorbed DOM retained in the soil after four sequential desorption steps. Both soil surface area and metal oxide content related positively to the level of sorption-desorption hysteresis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Selective adsorption of dissolved organic matter to mineral soils	GEODERMA												As soil solutions pass through forested mineral soils, the chemical and structural compositions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can alter substantially due to interactions with soil particle surfaces. Typically, adsorption processes dominate in mineral soils and the resulting concentration of DOC is reduced substantially. We studied changes in the molecular and structural compositions of DOC during equilibration with mineral soils collected across Canada (n = 43) and found that the overall aromatic content of DOC decreased with equilibration in almost all cases from using specific absorbance (SUVA) and the fluorescence index. The fluorescence index revealed that podzolic B horizons, with typically large adsorption capacity (Qmax), had the greatest reduction in aromaticity, which was partially explained by the much lower aromatic content of DOC desorbed from soils surfaces. In contrast, a decrease in DOC aromaticity for volcanic B horizons, also with high Qmax, was primarily due to adsorption. An unexpected finding was the release of extremely high (2.6 x 10(6) Da) and low (420 Da) molecular weight (MW) organic materials during equilibration using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPLC), for luvisols and podzols, respectively. In general, the average number-average MW (M-n) of DOC decreased for all soil types, but the greatest decrease in M-n was observed for mineral soils with large Qmax, including the podzolic and volcanic B horizons. Analysis of changes in FUR spectra revealed that the most prominent change to DOC functional groups was a reduction in carboxyl groups, which was even greater than the removal of aromatic DOC. The findings of this study emphasize that while DOC concentrations may decrease substantially during passage through mineral soils, it is valuable to consider the contribution of DOC from desorption of pre-existing soil C. Essential to the findings of this study was the inclusion of multiple analytical techniques to track changes to DOC character, and the inclusion of a wide range of mineral soils.

Passive capillary wick samplers (PCaps) are useful for soil solution sampling because they can provide measures of water and associated DOM-constituent flux in the unsaturated zone, however potential impacts of the wick material on DOM chemical properties has not been investigated yet. We therefore conducted experiments where aqueous soil extracts were transported along PCap fiberglass wicks in flow-through experiments. Results indicated limited dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sorption and DOM fractionation, and related parameters (total dissolved nitrogen [TDN], DOM fluorescence components) also remained largely unaffected. We note that this experiment does not account for the extent to which soil hydrologic processes may be affected by PCap field installations. However, given that the wicks did not fractionate significantly DOM, we compared field-based PCap DOM solution collected in situ with laboratory-based aqueous soil extraction (ASE) of DOM from the same soils to assess differences in DOM quality. Spectroscopic analysis of DOM in ASE solutions showed lower O-H stretch/carboxlyate band intensity ratios, more pronounced aliphatic C-H stretching (Fourier Transform Infrared analysis), higher specific ultraviolet-absorbance (SUVA(254)) values as well as greater abundance of fluorescence components in the region attributed to fulvic acids. We conclude that difference in molecular properties of DOM derived from laboratory ASE vs. PCap field collection of the same soils is attributable to differential disturbance effects of the two methods of soil solution collection.

Thus, in order to get the real spectra of the DOM, spectra correction of the effect of the instrument-specific response is necessary. However, some studies corrected DOM spectra, while still some studies didn't, leading to inconformity when comparing the data and the results from different groups. The present work evaluated the effect of spectra correction on the fluorescence characteristics of DOM. The results demonstrated that DOM spectra differed significantly after correction. Fluorescence intensities showed a decrease in the range of Ex/Em=220 similar to 450/250 similar to 500 nm, while an increase at Em<250 nm after correction. Fluorescence intensity ratio (FI) and humification index (HIX) derived from peak picking method showed a decrease after correction, while biological index (BIX) increased slightly. P-I,P-n, P-II,P-n and P-III,P-n, derived from FRI analysis exhibited a significant increase, while P-IV,P-n, and P-V,P-n. decreased. The results suggest that spectral correction should be included when analyzing the properties and trends of the DOM using EEM.																	1000-0593					NOV	2012	32	11					3044	3048		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2012)11-3044-05						WOS:000311266000035

The results showed that four fluorescent peak, fulvic-like (peak A), humic-like (peak C) and two tryptophan-like (peaks B and D), were identified in lake sediment DOM. Fluorescence quenching titration showed that peaks B and D were quenched gradually by adding additional Cu (II) and Hg (II), whereas humic-like substances had no systematic trend of the change of fluorescence intensity. Increasing fluorescence intensity value of humic-like substances can also be found. The modified Stern-Volmer model was used to calculate conditional stability constants (log K) and the percent of fluorophores (f %) which participate in the complexation between DOM and Cu (II), and Hg (II). The results showed that DOM-Cu (II) and DOM-Hg (II) complexes had higher log K values of 4.21-5.23 and the log K values of DOM-Cu (II) are much larger than the corresponding values for Hg (II). Peak B showed relatively low log K and high f % values than those of peak D. Different pollution sources which are mainly obtained from the upstream industrial wastewater. domestic sewage and return water of farmland irrigation tend to affect the stability constants and complexing capacities of Cu (II) and Hg (II).

Gusti Ngurah; Kim, Guebuem			Production, degradation, and flux of dissolved organic matter in the subterranean estuary of a large tidal flat	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved hydrolysable amino acids (THAA), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were studied in pore-water/groundwater samples (including seeping water) from a subterranean estuary (STE) of a large tidal flat in Hampyeong Bay, Korea, in July 2011. The relatively low alanine D/L ratios and high THAA concentrations in the pore-water closest to the sediment surface (0-10 cm) indicate the active production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from benthic algae, and the relatively low THAA concentrations and high D/L ratios in the subsurface pore-water (10-35 cm) indicate a relatively large presence of bio-degraded DOM. In the deep pore-water (35-75 cm), relatively low D/L ratios, high DOC concentrations, and intense humic-like fluorescence were observed, suggesting a net accumulation of less-reactive DOC in this layer. Overall, this STE appears to have net DOM sources because the concentrations of DOC (60-1700 mu M) in the pore-water decreased toward the land, the surface, and the low-salinity waters. The concentrations of DOC in the seeping water (185 +/- 52 mu M) were higher than those in the overlying seawater (144 +/- 9 mu M), resulting in net DOC fluxes of 2-5 x 10(9) g.C.yr(-1) through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into Hampyeong Bay. The organic matter compositions in the seeping water indicated that SGD introduced DOM from both the surface and subsurface layers. Our results highlight that tidal flats are important sources for DOM, implying that SGD-driven DOM plays an important role in coastal carbon cycles and biogeochemistry. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Photochemical production rates of alkyl nitrates were determined during the Gulf of Mexico East Coast Carbon Cruise (GOMECC). During this study, it was discovered that the relative production of alkyl nitrates may be influenced by coastal proximity with methyl and isopropyl nitrate production increasing relative to ethyl nitrate production in coastal waters. As a result of this observation, laboratory studies were carried out to determine alkyl nitrate production rates in the presence of Suwannee River humic and fulvic substances. As in the field experiments, methyl and isopropyl nitrate production increased in comparison to ethyl nitrate, suggesting that the source of dissolved organic matter affects relative alkyl nitrate production. This observation may be useful in quantifying the relative production of organic peroxy radicals from DOM as well as providing further insight into the factors that influence oceanic alkyl nitrate formation.

It has been shown in the previous literature to be photochemically stable to direct photolysis, but the role of photosensitization processes in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the rate of degradation is not well understood. The present results show that water and DOM (specifically the fulvic acid fraction) isolated from a eutrophic aquaculture catfish pond and a nearby stream (Deer Creek) at the Mississippi State University Delta Research and Extension Center facility in Stoneville, MS, significantly increased the phototransformation of OMP relative to direct photolysis. Similar results were reported for reference fulvic acids obtained from the International Humic Substances Society. Results from a combination of scavenging experiments and experiments conducted under anoxic conditions indicate the indirect photodegradation pathway occurs by hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen attack, and reaction with triplet excited-state DOM.																	0021-8561					OCT 3	2012	60	39					9801	9806		10.1021/jf302564d						WOS:000309335100003	22950359

Dissolved Organic Matter in Headwater Streams: Compositional Variability across Climatic Regions of North America	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the largest organic matter pool in freshwater systems, but much of it remains molecularly uncharacterized. Although freshwater systems cover only a small area of the earth's surface, inland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle. The traditional idea that rivers are simply conduits for refractory carbon delivery to coastal areas is inconsistent with carbon flux estimates, and streams have been shown to serve as reactors for DOM cycling. The overall quality of DOM, and its associated reactivity, can be related to its chemical composition and molecular structure. However, the variability of DOM composition in freshwater ecosystems, particularly in headwater streams, is poorly characterized. Detailed molecular studies of DOM from small streams across climatic regions, which could provide critical information regarding carbon dynamics on a more global scale, have not been performed. To address these issues, this study applies a multi-method analytical approach in an attempt to assess molecular characteristics of DOM and ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) in headwater streams from different climatic regions in North America. In general terms the chemical and molecular characteristics of UDOM from six different biomes were determined in unsurpassed detail to feature some clear general similarities but also specific differences. While the degree of similarity is remarkable, and suggests similar source strengths, such as soil-derived organic matter and/or similar diagenetic degradation processes for DOM from vastly different environments, each sample was clearly unique in its overall composition, featuring some distinct molecular patterns for at least one or more of the analytical determinations. Molecular and compositional differences of DOM from headwater streams should result from variations in DOM sources and localized environmental conditions, and consequently feature different photo- and bio-reactivity and associated re-mineralization potentials during fluvial transport. Such knowledge could assist in predicting the consequences of global change and its relationship to global carbon cycling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dissolved organic matter sources in large Arctic rivers	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The biomarker composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the six largest Arctic rivers was studied between 2003 and 2007 as part of the PARTNERS Project. Samples were collected over seasonal cycles relatively close to the river mouths. Here we report the lignin phenol and p-hydroxybenzene composition of Arctic river DOC in order to identify major sources of carbon. Arctic river DOC represents an important carbon conduit linking the large pools of organic carbon in the Arctic/Subarctic watersheds to the Arctic Ocean. Most of the annual lignin discharge (>75%) occurs during the two month of spring freshet with extremely high lignin concentrations and a lignin phenol composition indicative of fresh vegetation from boreal forests. The three large Siberian rivers, Lena, Yenisei, and Ob, which also have the highest proportion of forests within their watersheds, contribute about 90% of the total lignin discharge to the Arctic Ocean. The composition of river DOC is also characterized by elevated levels of p-hydroxybenzenes, particularly during the low flow season, which indicates a larger contribution from mosses and peat bogs. The lignin composition was strongly related to the average C-14-age of DOC supporting the abundance of young, boreal-vegetation-derived leachates during spring flood, and older, soil-, peat-, and wetland-derived DOC during groundwater dominated low flow conditions, particularly in the Ob and Yukon Rivers. We observed significant differences in DOC concentration and composition between the rivers over the seasonal cycles with the Mackenzie River being the most unique, the Lena River being similar to the Yenisei, and the Yukon being most similar to the Ob. The observed relationship between the lignin phenol composition and watershed characteristics suggests that DOC discharge from these rivers could increase in a warmer climate under otherwise undisturbed conditions.

It is known that sodicity increases DOM solubility, but the interactive effect of sodicity and salinity on DOM sorption and how this is affected by soil texture is not clear. We investigated the effect of salinity and sodicity on DOM sorption in soils with different clay contents. Four salt solutions with different EC and SAR were prepared using combinations of 1 M NaCl and 1 M CaCl2 stock solutions. The soils differing in texture (4, 13, 24 and 40% clay, termed S-4, S-13, S-24 and S-40) were repeatedly leached with these solutions until the desired combination of EC and SAR (EC1:5 1 and 5 dS m(-1) in combination with SAR <3 or >20) was reached. The sorption of DOC (derived from mature wheat straw) was more strongly affected by SAR than by EC. High SAR (>20) at EC1 significantly decreased sorption in all soils. However, at EC5, high SAR did not significantly reduce DOC sorption most likely because of the high electrolyte concentration of the soil solution. DOC sorption was greatest in S-24 (which had the highest CEC) at all concentrations of DOC added whereas DOC sorption did not differ greatly between S-40 and S-4 or S-13 (which had higher concentrations of Fe/Al than S-40). DOC sorption in salt-affected soil is more strongly controlled by CEC and Fe/Al concentration than by clay concentration per se except in sodic soils where DOC sorption is low due to the high sodium saturation of the exchange complex.

Variation in the photochemical lability of dissolved organic matter in a large boreal watershed	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Boreal watersheds contain a vast quantity of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from wetland and forest soils, yet variation in the potential for photochemical transformation of boreal aquatic DOM sources remains poorly understood. Laboratory solar radiation exposure experiments were conducted on DOM samples collected in three seasons, across nine sites, representing contrasting catchment composition and watershed position to assess variation in the photochemical lability of boreal DOM source and stable carbon isotopic signature (delta C-13) of photomineralized DOM. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss rates during laboratory exposure were lowest in summer, suggesting that DOM may have been more photo-degraded during summer. DOM from upstream portions of forested stream sites and wetland-influenced sites was more photolabile relative to downstream portions and the river DOM, suggesting potential losses in photolabile DOM downstream and in the lower reaches of the watershed. Increased a(254):a(350) and spectral slope following sample exposure suggest photoproduction of low molecular weight (LMW) CDOM and/or a higher photoreactivity of high molecular weight versus LMW compounds. Photomineralization of nitrogen was regulated by organic nitrogen concentration and resulted in NH4 (+)-photoproduction rates between 0.01 and 0.3 A mu M N h(-1) and ecologically significant increases in NH4 (+) for these waters. The delta C-13 of the photomineralized DOM was positively correlated to initial DOC concentration and generally lower when initial DOC concentrations were lower, suggesting variation in photomineralized DOM delta C-13 may be a result of kinetic isotope fractionation. Results from this study demonstrate significant variation in the photochemical lability of boreal watershed sources of DOM. Such variation suggests landscape and environmental change has the potential to alter the biogeochemical role photochemical transformations play in downstream portions of boreal watersheds.

Partitioning experiments were performed by mixing riverine suspended particles with the mixtures of different proportions of river and marine end-members and determining concentrations of Co, Cu and Cd in particulate and dissolved phases. Concentrations and distribution coefficients (K(d)s) between particulate and dissolved phases of Co and Cu were dependent on the presence of DOM. The K(d)s of Co and Cu in the mixtures in the presence of DOM were lower than those in mixtures that had been ultraviolet-irradiated (UV-irradiated) (absence of DOM), throughout the salinity gradient. In addition, speciation calculations estimated that a greater fraction of Co and Cu in the dissolved phase was present in organic form throughout the salinity gradient, while the seawater ion concentrations and ligand competition (e.g., competition from Ca and Mg and formation of stable and soluble chloro-, sulphato-, and carbonato complexes) had a small effect on the speciation of Co. These results indicate that DOM may play an important role in controlling the speciation and the particle-water interactions of Co and Cu in the estuarine waters. As for Cd, the effect of DOM on the interactions of this metal was less intense than for Co and Cu. Seawater ions appeared to act as an important variable for controlling the particle-water interactions of Cd in the estuarine waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonfractionated DOM samples from Lake Biwa (Japan), creek water, treated sewage effluents, and an extracted Lake Biwa fulvic acid (LBFA) standard were used as quenchers and compared at the same 1-naphthol with DOM organic carbon ratios found for low natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels (similar to 4.5?mg/L). Natural and effluent DOM (eDOM) samples were characterized by the DOC level, relative hydrophobicity (RH%), ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorbance and fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy. These parameters were compared with those of the reference LBFA standard. Concave-up Stern-Volmer plots accounted for both the partitioning and the adsorptive binding in the eDOMpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) system as compared with the nonspecific partitioning in the natural DOM-PAH system. Strong linear regressions (r2?>?0.80) between the log KDOC values, the RH%, the UV absorbances, and the Fl340-435-UV340 indices for the structural composition and molecular weights of the DOM samples were obtained. These results suggest that low molecular weight microbial fulvic acid (<800 Da) is dominant in the eDOM-PAH binding interactions, as well as in the distinct molecular structure of the eDOM samples, which resulted in fivefold to sixfold higher binding magnitude for 1-naphthol than for the other samples.

Dissolved organic matter export from a forested watershed during Hurricane Irene	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We incorporate high-resolution time-series data to calculate the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) transported during Hurricane Irene in Esopus Creek in New York (August 2011). During this 200-yr event the Esopus Creek experienced a 330-fold discharge increase and a 4-fold increase in concentration, resulting in the export of roughly 43% and 31% of its average annual DOC and DON fluxes, respectively, in just 5 days. The source of this large dissolved organic matter (DOM) flux also shifted during its course and showed an increased contribution of aromatic organic matter. We conclude that more frequent large events due to climate change will increase the export of terrigenous dissolved organic matter, and potentially impact the water quality and biogeochemistry of lakes and coastal systems. In addition, we show that the use of conventional models for extreme events lead to erroneous flux calculations, unless supported by high resolution data collected during the events.

Estimation of Reactive Thiol Concentrations in Dissolved Organic Matter and Bacterial Cell Membranes in Aquatic Systems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Organic thiols are highly reactive ligands and play an important role in the speciation of several metals and organic pollutants in the environment. Although small thiols can be isolated and their concentrations can be estimated using chromatographic and derivatization techniques, estimating concentrations of thiols associated with biomacromolecules and humic substances has been difficult. Here we present a fluorescence-spectroscopy-based method for estimating thiol concentrations in biomacromolecules and cell membranes using one of the soluble bromobimanes, monobromo(trimethylammonio)bimane (qBBr). The fluorescence of this molecule increases significantly when it binds to a thiol. The change in the sample fluorescence due to thiols reacting with qBBr is used to determine thiol concentration in a sample. Using this method, small thiols such as cysteine and glutathione can be detected in clean solutions down to similar to 50 nM without their separation and prior concentration. Thiols associated with dissolved organic matter (DOM) can be detected micromolar concentration, depending on the DOM background fluorescence. The charge on qBBr prevents its rapid diffusion across cell membranes, so qBBr is ideal for estimating thiol concentration at the cell membrane-water interface. This method was successfully used to determine the thiol concentration on the cell envelope of intact Bacillus subtilis to nanomolar concentration without any special sample preparation. Among the chemical species tested for potential interferences (other reduced sulfides methionine and cystine, carboxylate, salt (MgCl2)), carboxylates significantly influenced the absolute fluorescence signal of the thiol-qBBr complex. However, this does not affect the detection of thiols in heterogeneous mixtures using the presented method.																	0013-936X					SEP 18	2012	46	18					9854	9861		10.1021/es301381n						WOS:000308787800006	22916681

Copper(II) Binding by Dissolved Organic Matter: Importance of the Copper-to-Dissolved Organic Matter Ratio and Implications for the Biotic Ligand Model	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The ratio of copper to dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to affect the strength of copper binding by DOM, but previous methods to determine the Cu2+-DOM binding strength have generally not measured binding constants over the same Cu:DOM ratios. In this study, we used a competitive ligand exchange-solid-phase extraction (CLE-SPE) method to determine conditional stability constants for Cu2+-DOM binding at pH 6.6 and 0.01 M ionic strength over a range of Cu:DOM ratios that bridge the detection windows of copper-ion-selective electrode and voltarmmetry measurements. As the Cu:DOM ratio increased from 0.0005 to 0.1 mg of Cu/mg of DOM, the measured conditional binding constant (K-c(CuDOM)) decreased from 10(11.5) to 10(5.6) M-1. A comparison of the binding constants measured by CLE-SPE with those measured by copper-ion-selective electrode and voltammetry demonstrates that the Cu:DOM ratio is an important factor controlling Cu2+-DOM binding strength even for DOM isolates of different types and different sources and for whole water samples. The results were modeled with Visual MINTEQand compared to results from the biotic ligand model (BLM). The BLM was found to over-estimate Cu2+ at low total copper concentrations and under-estimate Cu2+ at high total copper concentrations.																	0013-936X					SEP 18	2012	46	18					9948	9955		10.1021/es301015p						WOS:000308787800017	22871072

The CDOM absorption coefficient at 280 nm (a (280)) showed a decreasing trend from nearshore to offshore areas while the spectral slope coefficient parameter calculated between wavelengths 275-295 nm (S (275-295)) showed an increase, indicative of decreasing aromaticity and molecular weight of the CDOM. The average a (280) in winter (1.47 +/- 0.50 m(-1)) was significantly higher than in summer (1.10 +/- 0.41 m(-1)), while the average S (275-295) in winter (26.7 +/- 5.2 A mu m(-1)) was significantly lower than in summer (30.6 +/- 5.5 A mu m(-1)), demonstrating clear seasonal variation in CDOM abundance and properties in the Taiwan Strait. A three-endmember conservative mixing model showed that local terrestrial CDOM inputs from several rivers along the western coast were small (< 5%). However, the distribution of CDOM in the Taiwan Strait is mainly controlled by water mass movement [i.e., the Zhe-min Coastal Current (ZCC) and the Kuroshio Branch Current (KBC) in winter and the South China Sea Water (SCSW) in summer]. Biological activity was also an important factor affecting the distribution of CDOM in the offshore region in summer months.

Here, we show that dissolved organic matter (DOM) in environmental waters can mediate the reduction of ionic Ag and Au to their metallic nanoparticles under natural sunlight, suggesting that this process may be general for metals with high reduction potential. We demonstrated that the reduction was mediated by superoxide from photoirradiation of the phenol group in DOM, and the dissolved O-2 significantly enhanced the formation of Ag nanoparticles. These results imply that previous knowledge about O-2-induced dissolution and its effect on persistence of Ag nanoparticles should be reconsidered in a sunlit DOM-rich aqueous environment. This study can also shed light on understanding possible natural sources of Ag and Au nanoparticles in the aquatic environment, which is possibly critical in the supergene enrichment of Ag and Au.

J	Fagnani, E; Guimaraes, JR; Fadini, PS				Fagnani, Enelton; Guimaraes, Jose Roberto; Fadini, Pedro Sergio			Mercury in the Waters of the Jundiai River, SP, Brazil: The Role of Dissolved Organic Matter	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Many developing countries have regions of high demographic density, where untreated residuary waters from different sources are often discharged into rivers, streams and other water bodies. This paper discusses the reducing action of organic matter of anthropic origin on the mercury redox cycle in the Jundiai River impacted by discharged wastes, and on the Pirai River, a non-impacted water body. The total mercury concentrations in these locations vary from 1.7 to 32 ng L-1 in the former and from 0.6 to 10.6 ng L-1 in the latter. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations of up to 68.3 and 6.5 mg L-1 were observed, confirming the higher impact on the Jundiai River. It was found that an inverse correlation between the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and total mercury was stronger in the Jundiai River, given that it receives higher organic loads, suggesting that organic matter exerts a reducing action on mercury, which is released as gas into the atmosphere. This correlation was not observed in the Pirai River, where the organic matter of natural origin is probably not sufficiently labile to act intensely upon the Hg redox cycle, favoring the metal transport.

Is nitrogen functionality responsible for contrasted responses of riverine dissolved organic matter in pyrolysis?	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS												Fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the Loire and the Gartempe rivers were obtained using Amberlite XAD resin fractionation procedure. According to the eluting system used and to the polarity of their components, the fractions were termed hydrophobic (HPO) and transphilic (TPI) for the Loire (elution with acetonitrile/water mixture) and hydrophobic acid (HPOA) and transphilic acid (TPIA) for the Gartempe (elution with NaOH). In addition, for the Loire, colloids (COL) were pre-isolated through a dialysis step. The composition of the three fractions from the Loire was investigated with solid state cross polarisation/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) C-13 NMR and Curie point pyrolysis at 650 degrees C with and without tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Separation and identification of the released compounds were performed using gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and focussed on nitrogen-containing pyrolysis products (N-products). Quantitative differences were observed between the N-product distribution of the HPO and TPI fractions, whilst the few N-products from the COL fraction exhibited different structures corresponding to peptidoglycan contribution. Comparison with previous results obtained for two DOM fractions (HPOA and TPIA) from the Gartempe river (France) revealed that pyrolysis detection of nitrogen containing molecules is not only related to the nitrogen content of the fractions, even in the case of similar hydrophobicity, but also likely to the functionality of nitrogen in the macromolecule sources. To correlate the molecular level information about N-containing moieties with the functionality of nitrogen in the macromolecular sources, the five fractions of DOM were investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and solid state cross polarisation/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) N-15 NMR. C1s XPS and N-15 NMR analyses revealed an important contribution from amide nitrogen in all the DOM fractions, with a large increase from the hydrophobic fractions to the transphilic and colloids ones. Moreover, N-15 NMR revealed an additional pyrrole nitrogen contribution in the HPO fraction of the Loire and in the TPI and TPIA fractions of both rivers. For the two rivers, the delta N-15 values were maximal for the fraction containing the highest proportion of amide N, and decreased in parallel with increasing pyrrole N contribution. Only the hydrophobic acid fraction of the Gartempe, which did not contain any pyrrole N was characterised by a lack of N-containing pyrolysis products, suggesting that their detection could be dependent on the presence of pyrrole N in the macromolecule sources.

J	Cory, RM; Kaplan, LA				Cory, Rose M.; Kaplan, Louis A.			Biological lability of streamwater fluorescent dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the biological lability of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) from a temperate Piedmont stream. Plug-flow bioreactors, colonized and maintained with natural stream water, were used to determine the concentrations of stream-water biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) and relative concentrations of FDOM within operationally defined biodegradability classes. Labile molecules with turnover times of hours are metabolized within the stream reach where they originated; semi-labile molecules with turnover times of days travel out of the reach and are transported downstream before being metabolized; and a more recalcitrant class with a longer but undetermined turnover time flows through the river network without being metabolized. Between 26% and 31% of the DOC was biodegradable, with 8.6% labile and the balance semi-labile. Humic-like FDOM was a proxy for more recalcitrant DOM, exhibiting a +/- 2% change as a function of increased bioreactor residence time. Humic-like FDOM represents only the more recalcitrant and perhaps the more hydrophobic constituents and not the ecologically important semi-labile humic substances within the BDOC pool. Tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like FDOM constituents included not only labile DOM, but also semi-labile, and more recalcitrant moieties. For example, 13% of the tryptophan-like FDOM was labile, 14% was semi-labile, and 73% was more recalcitrant, while tyrosine-like FDOM was 100% biodegraded and the majority (44-69%) was classified as labile. Collectively our results challenge some previous assessments of FDOM lability classifications and highlight the need to connect fluorescence characteristics of DOM to residence times of different carbon pools that spiral through a river network.

J	Fichot, CG; Benner, R				Fichot, Cedric G.; Benner, Ronald			The spectral slope coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (S275-295) as a tracer of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon in river-influenced ocean margins	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The present study demonstrates that the spectral slope coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) between 275 nm and 295 nm (S275-295) can be used as a tracer of the percent terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (%tDOC) in river-influenced ocean margins, where rivers exert an important control on carbon dynamics and CO2 fluxes. Absorption coefficients of CDOM and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved lignin were measured on a seasonal basis in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM). A strong, linear relationship between lignin concentrations and CDOM absorption coefficients indicated lignin is an important chromophore in this environment. The dual nature of lignin as an important chromophore in CDOM and as a terrigenous component of DOC facilitated development of the tracer. The applicability of the tracer relies on the existence of a strong, nonlinear relationship between S275-295 and the DOC-normalized lignin yield in rivers and along the freshwater-marine continuum in the NGoM. Physical mixing and the effects of photodegradation on S275-295 and dissolved lignin were largely responsible for maintaining this relationship, suggesting the tracer is applicable to surface waters of most river-influenced ocean margins. The spectral slope coefficient (S275-295) provides new capabilities to trace tDOC on synoptic scales of relevance to ocean margins and represents an important tool for improving ocean carbon budgets.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2012	57	5					1453	1466		10.4319/lo.2012.57.5.1453						WOS:000308640600016

Selective loss and preservation of lake water dissolved organic matter fluorescence during long-term dark incubations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The biogeochemical processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in inland waters is inherently related to its molecular structure and ecological function. Controlled bioassays are a valuable tool to analyze these relationships, but are seldom conducted and compared at temporal scales that typically prevail in natural inland waters. Here we incubated water from six boreal lakes in the dark and examined changes to the initial fluorescence and absorbance after 3.5 years. We identified five fluorescence components with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis (C-C, C-M, C-A, C-X and C-T) and found a consistent change in the relative intensity of two dominant PARAFAC components (increase in C-A:C-C, corresponding to Peak A:Peak C), commonly found in lake water, that represent terrestrially-derived DOM. Surprisingly, we only found minor changes to specific absorbance (SUVA), and did not find any changes to other spectral indexes including the fluorescence index, humification index and freshness index. By incorporating lakes spanning a wide range of initial total organic carbon concentrations (3.7 to 32.5 mg L-1), water residence times, and spectral characteristics (e.g. SUVA 1.13 to 3.77 L.mg C-1.m(-1)), we found that the relative intensities of two humic-like peaks were the most revealing of changes to DOM structure during dark incubations. We also verified that inner filter effects were adequately corrected within the concentration range of incubated samples. Thus, the processing of DOM under dark conditions, including microbial decomposition and flocculation, may have a greater influence on the humic-like peaks, particularly C-C (Peak C), with negligible changes to more commonly used spectral indexes.

Dissolved organic matter was extracted and its content and structure were characterized by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra, UV-Vis specrtra and FTIR spectra. The results showed that an amount of 377.6 mg.L-1 dissolved organic carbon (DOG) was removed during the whole treatment process, and the total removal rate was up to 78.34%. The 25.56% of DOG in the adjusting tank was removed during the anaerobic zone, 41.58% of DOG in anaerobic effluent was removed during the oxidation ditch, while 50.19% of DOG in the oxidation ditch effluent decreased in the MBR process. The anaerobic process increased the content of unsaturated compound and polysaccharides in leachate DOM, which improved the leachate biochemical characteristics. The unsaturated compound and polysaccharides were removed effectively during being in oxidation ditch. Protein-like and humic-like fluorescence peaks were observed in the adjusting tank and anaerobic zone, while humic-like fluorescence peaks were just presented in the oxidation ditch and MBR processing. Protein-like and fulvic-like substances were biodegraded in the adjusting tank and anaerobic zone, while humic-like materials were removed in the MBR process.																	1000-0593					SEP	2012	32	9					2528	2533		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2012)09-2528-06						WOS:000308855500049

Of the 350 strains isolated, 228 (65.1%) were affiliated with the Polynucleobacter subclusters PnecC (30.0%) and PnecD (35.1%). Significant positive correlations between fluorescence in situ hybridization and SEAM data were observed in the relative abundance of PnecC and PnecD bacteria to Polynucleobacter communities (PnecC + PnecD). Isolates were mainly PnecC bacteria in the samples with a high specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), and a low total hydrolysable neutral carbohydrate and amino acid (THneutralCH + THAA) content of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) fraction, which is known to be correlated with a high humic content. In contrast, the PnecD bacteria were abundant in samples with high chlorophyll a and/or THneutralCH + THAA concentrations, indicative of primary productivity. With few exceptions, differences in the relative abundance of PnecC and PnecD in each sample, determined using a high-sensitivity cultivation-based approach, were due to DOM quality. These results suggest that the major DOM component in the field, which is allochthonously or autochthonously derived, is a key factor for ecological niche separation between PnecC and PnecD subclusters.

Contrasting effects of organic C components on pesticide degradation have been reported; however, most studies have used model organic compounds with compositions and concentrations which differ substantially from those found in the environment. Degradation of atrazine (AT) by Chelatobacter heintzii SalB was monitored in liquid batch assays in the absence or presence of well-defined model C compounds (glucose, gluconate and citrate) as model DOM (mDOM) or complex, less-defined, environmental DOM solutions (eDOM: isolated humic substances, soil and plant residue extracts) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Glucose significantly increased AT degradation rate by more than a factor of 8 at and above 2.5 mg C L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). Optical density measurements showed that this stimulation is related to microbial growth. Gluconate and citrate had no effects unless at non-relevant concentrations (1,000 mg DOC L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) at which stimulations (gluconate) or inhibitions (citrate) were found. The effects of eDOM added at 10 mg DOC L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) on AT degradation were generally small. The AT degradation time was reduced by factors 1.4-1.9 in the presence of humic acids and eDOM from soils amended with plant residues; however, no effects were found for fulvic acids or eDOM from a soil leachate solution or extracted from unamended peat or forest soil. In conclusion, DOM supplied as both mDOM and eDOM did not inhibit AT degradation at environmentally relevant concentrations, and stimulation can be found for selected DOM samples and this is partly related to its effect on growth.

We present a conceptual model of the vertical movement of dissolved organic matter with soil water, which deviates from the view of a chromatographic stripping along the flow path. It assumes temporal immobilization (sorptive or by co-precipitation), followed by microbial processing, and re-release (by desorption or dissolution) into soil water of altered compounds. The proposed scheme explains well depth trends in age and composition of dissolved organic matter as well as of solid-phase organic matter in soil. It resolves the paradox of soil organic matter being oldest in the youngest part of the soil profile - the deep mineral subsoil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lonborg, C; Alvarez-Salgado, XA				Lonborg, Christian; Anton Alvarez-Salgado, Xose			Recycling versus export of bioavailable dissolved organic matter in the coastal ocean and efficiency of the continental shelf pump	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												At least 15% of the 2 Pg y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that accumulates in the surface layer of the open ocean has been exported from the ocean margins. The C:N:P stoichiometry of the production and microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the coastal ocean conditions the quality of the exported substrates. In this work, DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) bioavailability measurements from published bottle incubation experiments have been compiled and reanalyzed to examine the role of bioavailable DOM (BDOM) in the coastal ocean. DOM bioavailability decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the sequence DOP > DON > DOC, with bioavailable DOC (BDOC) representing 22 +/- 12% (mean +/- SD) of the total DOC, bioavailable DON (BDON) 35 +/- 13% of the total DON and bioavailable DOP (BDOP) 70 +/- 18% of the total DOP. This suggests that the role of DOM on the recycled and export production of the coastal ocean is more relevant for the P than for the N and for the N than for the C biogeochemical cycles. First-order microbial degradation rate constants (kappa) of BDOM (normalized to 15 degrees C) increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the same sequence, with kappa(C) being 0.066 +/- 0.065 day(-1), kappa(N) 0.111 +/- 0.096 and kappa(P) 0.154 +/- 0.137 day(-1). Significant (p < 0.001) power relationships were found among kappa(C), kappa(N) and kappa(P) (R-2 = 0.84-0.87). The C: N: P molar ratio of the DOM that resists microbial degradation was extremely depleted in N and P, 2835 (+/- 3383): 159 (+/- 187): 1, compared with the BDOM fraction, 197 (+/- 111): 25 (+/- 16): 1. The flushing time (tau) of the coastal ocean in relation to the turnover time of BDOM (1/kappa), i.e., tau . kappa, dictates the fate-degradation versus accumulation-of the large scale export of BDOM, which could fuel parts of the oceanic new production and influence the N/P limitation of the open ocean.

Moreover, bioavailable shares of DOC and DON were evaluated with natural bacterial surface and deepwater samples. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) accumulated in the surface layer throughout the productive season, and the accumulated DOM was N-rich (molar C:N ratio of 10) compared to the bulk DOM pool (C:N 20-29). Redundancy analysis showed a negative correlation between phytoplankton and DOM concentrations, suggesting that most DOM release occurred during declining phases of spring and late summer algal blooms. During the spring bloom, bioavailable shares of DOM were small, whereas during and after the late summer bloom of filamentous cyanobacteria, 3-9% and 10-20% of the respective total DOC and DON pools were degraded by bacteria within 2 weeks. Vertical mixing over the thermocline was estimated by constructing a steady state budget for water and salt mass flows between key GoF basin compartments (inflows equal outflows). The flow estimates suggested that the net changes in surface DOC and DON pools underestimated the respective total accumulations by ca 40% and 20%, respectively, over the 4-mo thermal stratification period. Thus, integral export of surface DOC and DON after autumn overturn amounted to ca 710 mmol C m(-2) and 40 mmol N m(-2), corresponding respectively to ca 12-25% and 11% of reported annual particulate organic carbon and nitrogen sedimentation in our study area.

J	Kutser, T				Kutser, Tiit			The possibility of using the Landsat image archive for monitoring long time trends in coloured dissolved organic matter concentration in lake waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Recent studies indicate that lakes are regulators of carbon cycling and climate. Therefore, it is important to know how the lake carbon content has changed over the last decades. In situ long time data series about the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes are rare. The only potential way to study retrospectively the changes in lake carbon over the last decades is by means of remote sensing data provided there are sensors that can provide data about coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lakes over long periods. Landsat data archive contains images from 1984 to nowadays and covers the whole Earth. Although the sensors were not designed for remote sensing of aquatic environments it is still tempting to utilise the long data series. Landsat 4, Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 imagery available in free Landsat image archive was compared with time series of CDOM in situ data from 19 sampling stations available in the Swedish University of Natural Sciences lake monitoring database. There was no correlation between the image and in situ data when all the above mentioned data were used. Low radiometric resolution of the sensor, small size of many lakes (= large adjacency effects) and high concentration of CDOM (negligible water leaving radiation) could be the reasons. The results were more promising (R-2 = 0.62) when Lake Malaren stations were analysed separately. The lake is sufficiently large and with variable, but not extremely high. CDOM content. The Lake Malaren in situ data showed very different trends in CDOM concentrations in different basins of the lake over the last 45 years. Although the correlation between the image and in situ data was a bit low for accurate daily estimation of CDOM concentrations from Landsat data it could allow detecting general trends in lake CDOM content. Unfortunately, there is currently a gap in Landsat archive (for our study sites) between 1988 and 1998 which makes calculations of long time trends unreasonable for the time being.

Characterization of dissolved organic matter in decomposing Norway spruce and silver birch litter	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in transport, storage and cycling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in forest soils where litter is one of the main sources. The aim was to study the amount and characteristics of DOM leached from freshly fallen litters of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and their mixture during decomposition. DOM was collected after irrigation on eight occasions during 252 days incubation in the laboratory at about 18 degrees C, including one freeze-thaw cycle. During the incubation about 3335% of C from birch and spruce litter and 40% of C from their mixture was lost. The total cumulative flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the mixture of litters was approximately 40% larger than that from single litters. The flux of DOC, DON, phenolic compounds and proteins followed a two-stage pattern during decomposition. In the first stage the initially large fluxes decreased gradually. In the second stage, after freezing and thawing, the fluxes tended to increase again. Mixing birch and spruce litters and a freeze-thaw cycle seems to increase the decomposition of litter and result in the increased flux of DOC, DON and phenolic compounds. The flux of hemicelluloses and the degradability of DOM were large at the first leaching occasion and decreased during the incubation. Birch had a 40% larger total flux of easily degradable DOM than spruce, supporting the previous consistent signs of greater microbial biomass and activities related to C and N cycling in soil under birch than under spruce. It is known that recalcitrant DOM might be stabilized whereas labile DOM may promote microbial activity and nutrient cycling. We conclude that the storage and cycling of C and N is affected by both tree species and degradation stage of litter in forest soils.																	1351-0754					AUG	2012	63	4					476	486		10.1111/j.1365-2389.2012.01457.x						WOS:000307728800004

Modeling the photo-oxidation of dissolved organic matter by ultraviolet radiation in freshwater lakes: Implications for mercury bioavailability	CHEMOSPHERE												Uncertainties in projected ultraviolet (UV) radiation may lead to future increases in UV irradiation of freshwater lakes. Because dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the main binding phase for mercury (Hg) in freshwater lakes, an increase in DOC photo-oxidation may affect Hg speciation and bioavailability. We quantified the effect of DOC concentration on the rate of abiotic DOC photo-oxidation for five lakes (DOC = 3.27-12.3 mg L-1) in Kejimkujik National Park, Canada. Samples were irradiated with UV-A or UV-B radiation over a 72-h period. UV-B radiation was found to be 2.36 times more efficient at photo-oxidizing DOC than UV-A, with energy-normalized rates of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production ranging from 3.8 x 10(-5) to 1.1 x 10(-4) mg L-1 J(-1) for UV-A, and from 6.0 x 10(-5) to 3.1 x 10(-4) mg L-1 J(-1) for UV-B. Energy normalized rates of DIC production were positively correlated with DOC concentrations. Diffuse integrated attenuation coefficients were quantified in situ (UV-A K-d = 0.056-0.180 J cm(-1); UV-B K-d = 0.015-0.165 J cm(-1)) and a quantitative depth-integrated model for yearly DIC photo-production in each lake was developed. The model predicts that, UV-A produces between 3.2 and 100 times more DIC (1521-2851 mg m(-2) year(-1)) than UV-B radiation (29.17-746.7 mg M-2 year(-1)). Future increases in UV radiation may increase DIC production and increase Hg bioavailability in low DOC lakes to a greater extent than in high DOC lakes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissolved organic matter reduces algal accumulation of methylmercury	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) significantly decreased accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) by the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana in laboratory experiments. Live diatom cells accumulated two to four times more MeHg than dead cells, indicating that accumulation may be partially an energy-requiring process. Methylmercury enrichment in diatoms relative to ambient water was measured by a volume concentration factor (VCF). Without added DOM, the maximum VCF was 32?x?104, and the average VCF (from 10 to 72 h) over all experiments was 12.6?x?104. At very low (1.5 mg/L) added DOM, VCFs dropped by approximately half. At very high (20 mg/L) added DOM, VCFs dropped 10-fold. Presumably, MeHg was bound to a variety of reduced sulfur sites on the DOM, making it unavailable for uptake. Diatoms accumulated significantly more MeHg when exposed to transphilic DOM extracts than hydrophobic ones. However, algal lysate, a labile type of DOM created by resuspending a marine diatom in freshwater, behaved similarly to a refractory DOM isolate from San Francisco Bay. Addition of 67?mu M L-cysteine resulted in the largest drop in VCFs, to 0.28?x?104. Although the DOM composition influenced the availability of MeHg to some extent, total DOM concentration was the most important factor in determining algal bioaccumulation of MeHg. Environ. Toxicol.

Comparison of dialysis and solid-phase extraction for isolation and concentration of dissolved organic matter prior to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												We compare two methods, solid-phase extraction (SPE) and dialysis, commonly used for extraction and concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) prior to molecular characterization by electrospray ionization (ESI) and ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Spectra of DOM samples from Minnesota and Sweden peatlands that were extracted with styrene divinyl benzene polymer SPE sorbents included ions with formulas that had higher oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratios than spectra of DOM from the same samples after de-salting by dialysis. The SPE method was not very effective in extracting several major classes of DOM compounds that had high ESI efficiencies, including carboxylic acids and organo-sulfur compounds, and that out-competed other less-functionalized compounds (e.g., carbohydrates) for charge in the ESI source. The large abundance of carboxylic acids in the dialysisextracted DOM, likely the result of in situ microbial production, makes it difficult to see other (mainly hydrophilic) compounds with high O/C ratios. Our results indicate that, while dialysis is generally preferable for the isolation of DOM, for samples with high microbial inputs, the use of both isolation methods is recommended for a more accurate molecular representation.																	1618-2642					AUG	2012	404	2					447	457		10.1007/s00216-012-6120-6						WOS:000306330000018	22699231

DOM in the raw wastewater (RW) and the effluents of the grit chamber, primary sedimentation tank, anaerobic tank, oxidation tank (OT), and secondary sedimentation tank (SST) were fractionated and characterized. Hydrophilic fraction (HPI) was the predominant component in RW, followed by acidic fractions. The results also showed that 89.7% of the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 52.5% of UV-254, as well as 86.4% of trihalomethanes (THMs) precursors were removed by wastewater treatment plants in summer, while the removal efficiency of DOC and THMs formation potential decreased in winter. A/O facilities were more effective in removing HPI related organics than other units, particularly in summer. Structural changes of organic fractions in different units were also characterized via spectrum analysis. All of the findings were beneficial to optimization of the operation of wastewater treatment plant and reclamation of the secondary effluent.																	1944-3994					AUG	2012	46	1-3					295	303		10.1080/19443994.2012.677557						WOS:000304590700033		
J	Wu, JZ; Sun, HW; Wang, CP; Li, YH				Wu Ji-zhou; Sun Hong-wen; Wang Cui-ping; Li Yong-hong			Binding of Pyrene to Different Molecular Weight Fractions of Dissolved Organic Matter: Effects of Chemical Composition and Steric Conformation	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN CHINESE UNIVERSITIES												The binding constant(K-DOM) of pyrene onto different molecular weight(M-w) fractions of a dissolved organic matter(DOM) extract from an estuarine sediment was measured via a fluorescence quenching method, and the possible binding mechanisms were discussed. The influence of water chemical parameters on pyrene binding was studied to elucidate the effects of DOM steric conformation. DOM fraction with larger M-w(>14000) showed a greater K-DOM(2.02x10(5)) than that with smaller M-w did, and the K(DOM)s were 1.16x10(5) and 1.13x10(5) for the fractions with M-w. of 1000-14000 and <1000, respectively. The K(DOM)s of different M-w DOM fractions were correlated positively with the atomic ratio of C/H and absorbance at 280 nm; while a negative correlation existed between K-DOM and (O+C)/N (atomic ratio), and K-DOM and O-containing groups. These correlations indicate the positive influence of aromatic structure and the negative effect of polarity on DOM binding capacity. Infrared spectroscopy revealed that specific interactions existed between pyrene and the DOM fraction with larger M-w besides hydrophobic partition, i.e., NH-pi-interaction in DOM moiety(1000-14000) and pi-pi electron donor acceptor(EDA) forces in DOM moiety (>14000). K-DOM varied in a complex pattern with increasing cation concentration and pH, which could be explained by the change in DOM steric conformation. Formed aggregates favored the lipophilic partition of pyrene. However, the accessibility to some interior binding sites became low when the aggregate was too large, leading to a reduced K-DOM.																	1005-9040	2210-3171				JUL 25	2012	28	4					624	630								WOS:000308279600016

It is one of the largest active pools of organic carbon on earth and hence plays an important role in the global carbon cycling. As it contains a large number of chromophores, such as benzene ring, carboxyl, hydroxy, carbonyl, etc., it can adsorb sunlight at certain wavelength regions of the spectrum. A variety of reactive free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and hydrated electron, could be generated during this process. These reactive free radicals could play an important role in the photo-transformation and photo-degradation of contaminants in the natural water. In different natural water, the generation of reactive free radicals is very different, resulting the mechanism and pathway of photo-transformation of various contaminats in natural water. This paper reviews the DOM-mediated generating pathways of major reactive radicals, including hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, hydrated electron and excited triplet states of the CDOM. Then influences of them on the photo-transformation and photo-degradation of various contaminants, inculding inorganic ion, methylmercury, polyaromatic hydrocarbon, phenols, and pesticides, etc., in the natural water are discussed. The necessary works in the future research are also briefly outlined.

TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) proteins allow Gram-negative bacteria to take up scarce resources from nutrient-limiting environments as well as siderophores, heme, vitamin B12, and recently identified carbohydrates. Thus, the characterization of TBDT distribution and functions is essential to better understand the contribution TBDT to DOM assimilation and its consequences on nutrient cycling in the environment. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study presents the distribution of encoded known and putative TBDT proteins in the genomes of microorganisms and from the Global Ocean Survey data. Using a Lek clustering algorithm and substrate specificities, the TBDT sequences were mainly classified into the following three groups: (1) DOM transporters; (2) Siderophores/Vitamins transporters; and (3) Heme/Hemophores/Iron(heme)-binding protein transporters. Diverse TBDTs were found in the genomes of oligotroph Citromicrobium bathyomarinum JL354 and Citromicrobium sp JLT1363 and were highly expressed in the stationary phase of bacterial growth. The results show that the Gammaproteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group bacteria accounted for the majority of the TBDT gene pool in marine surface waters. Conclusions/Significance: The results of this study confirm the ecological importance of TBDTs in DOM assimilation for bacteria in marine environments owing to a wide range of substrate utilization potential in the ubiquitous Gammaproteobacteria and CFB group bacteria.																	1932-6203					JUL 19	2012	7	7							e41204	10.1371/journal.pone.0041204						WOS:000306956300067	22829928	
J	Jurgensone, I; Aigars, J				Jurgensone, Iveta; Aigars, Juris			Bioavailability of riverine dissolved organic matter to phytoplankton in the marine coastal waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Nutrient inputs from catchments with intensive agriculture are mostly dominated by inorganic nutrients, whereas the contribution of organic nutrients from catchments with natural forests can be considerable but there is a pooere understanding of this nutrient source. Consequently this study investigated spring, summer and autumn phytoplankton community responses to enrichment by riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM). Dissolved organic substances were extracted from the Daugava River, fractionated into three molecular size classes: 1) 5-100 kDa, 2) 100-1000 kDa, and 3) > 1000 kDa, and added to a microcosm with natural assemblages from the Gulf of Riga. During the spring the phytoplankton community was dominated (97%) by diatoms and the species composition did not change over the course of the experiment. Specific species and functional groups of the summer and autumn phytoplankton communities responded positively to these treatments. Small-celled cyanobacteria and Monoraphidium contortum responded to almost all size fractions of DOM for the summer and autumn experiments. Oocystis spp. characteristic for the summer and Chaetoceros wighamii, Cyclotella spp., Thalassiosira baltica for the autumn responded to treatment by two and three size classes of organic substances, respectively, while Merismopedia spp. shifted from one food source to another during the summer experiment.

Determination of relative molecular weights of fluorescent components in dissolved organic matter using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation and parallel factor analysis	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												Dissolved organic matter in aquatic systems is of variable structure and composition. Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation coupled to UV/vis diode array and fluorescence detectors (AF4-DAD-EEM) was used to assess the size and optical properties of dissolved organic matter. The results were analyzed using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and statistical fractogram deconvolution to correlate fluorescing components with molecular weight fractions. This coupling, which is shown for the first time in this work, is a powerful method capable of revealing novel information about the size properties of PARAFAC components. Tyrosine/polyphenol-like fluorescence (peak B) was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with the smallest size group (relative molecular weight = 310 +/- 10 Da), microbial humic-like and terrestrial visible humic-like fluorescence (peaks M, C, A) with the intermediate size group (1600 +/- 150 Da), and terrestrial fulvic-like and tryptophan/polyphenol-like fluorescence (peaks A and T) with the largest size group (4300 +/- 660 Da).

Dissolved organic carbon and chromophoric dissolved organic matter properties of rivers in the USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) parameters were measured over a range of discharge in 30 U. S. rivers, covering a diverse assortment of fluvial ecosystems in terms of watershed size and landscape drained. Relationships between CDOM absorption at a range of wavelengths (a(254), a(350), a(440)) and DOC in the 30 watersheds were found to correlate strongly and positively for the majority of U. S. rivers. However, four rivers (Colorado, Colombia, Rio Grande and St. Lawrence) exhibited statistically weak relationships between CDOM absorption and DOC. These four rivers are atypical, as they either drain from the Great Lakes or experience significant impoundment of water within their watersheds, and they exhibited values for dissolved organic matter (DOM) parameters indicative of autochthonous or anthropogenic sources or photochemically degraded allochthonous DOM and thus a decoupling between CDOM and DOC. CDOM quality parameters in the 30 rivers were found to be strongly correlated to DOM compositional metrics derived via XAD fractionation, highlighting the potential for examining DOM biochemical quality from CDOM measurements. This study establishes the ability to derive DOC concentration from CDOM absorption for the majority of U. S. rivers, describes characteristics of riverine systems where such an approach is not valid, and emphasizes the possibility of examining DOM composition and thus biogeochemical function via CDOM parameters. Therefore, the usefulness of CDOM measurements, both laboratory-based analyses and in situ instrumentation, for improving spatial and temporal resolution of DOC fluxes and DOM dynamics in future studies is considerable in a range of biogeochemical studies.																	0148-0227					JUL 3	2012	117								G03001	10.1029/2011JG001928						WOS:000306223900002

Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), lignin phenols, amino acids, neutral sugars, and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) absorption coefficients were higher in the AR than in the MR. Significantly lower syringyl to vanillyl phenol ratios (S : V) in the AR indicated substantial contributions from gymnosperms (e. g., Taxodium distichum). The lowest S : V values in the AR were measured during maximal litterfall in October-November when yields of lignin phenols were highest. Lower spectral slope coefficients (S275-295) in the AR were indicative of relatively high-molecular-weight CDOM. Yields and compositions of amino acids and neutral sugars indicated DOM in the AR was more bioavailable than in the MR. Nitrogen removal in the floodplain was in part responsible for the significantly lower concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in the AR. Seasonal variability in DOM composition was greater in the AR. About 35% of the DOC and > 44% of the lignin phenols, amino acids, and neutral sugars exported from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system was carried by the AR, thereby revealing the important role of the AR in DOM export from the river system. DOC export from rivers was predominantly controlled by water discharge. The long-term (1996-2010) average DOC export from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system was 2.70 Tg yr(-1) (MR: 1.75 Tg yr(-1); AR: 0.95 Tg yr(-1)), accounting for 0.8-1.1% of global riverine DOC export.

The algal DOM released from Microcystis aeruginosa and Staurastrum dorsidentiferum is relatively stable, while a part of the algal DOM released from Cryptomonas ovata may be easily decomposed. Before biodegradation, two fulvic-like fluorescence peaks (A and B) and a protein-like fluorescence peak (C) and another peak with E-x/E-m values of 320 - 330/390 nm (peak D) were observed in the algal DOM released from three kinds of phytoplankton. The fulvic-like fluorophores may be refractory regardless of the kinds of phytoplankton, while protein-like fluorophores released from Microcystis aeruginosa and Staurastrum dorsidentiferum may be relatively refractory and those from Cryptomonas ovata may be unstable. Peak D in the surface water of Lake Biwa may be attributed to low-molecular-weight substances produced during cultivation and/or biodegradation of several kinds of phytoplankton. The ratios of the fluorescence intensities (RFI/DOC) of peak A to peak B in algal DOM (<1.0) were lower than those in soil Dando FA (1.8). On the other hand, no relationships between peak A and peak C were observed for three kinds of phytoplankton.																	0910-6340					JUL	2012	28	7					675	681								WOS:000307141900008	22790369

Characterization of dissolved organic matter in the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii and its effect on the mobility of zinc	CHEMOSPHERE												Pot experiments were performed to investigate the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the rhizosphere soil of hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) and a non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) of Sedum alfredii and its effects on the mobility of zinc (Zn). DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into six fractions. The acid fraction was the predominant component of DOM in the rhizosphere of S. alfredii, with hydrophilic acid (HiA), hydrophilic base (HiB), and hydrophilic neutral (HiN) in HE-DOM being 1.6, 1.9, and 1.2 times higher respectively, as compared to NHE-DOM. ATR-FTIR results showed that DOM in the rhizosphere of S. alfredii consisted of a mixture of hydroxylated and carboxylic acids, and HE-DOM exhibited more C=O, O-H, C=C and C-O functional groups than NHE-DOM. Resin equilibration experiment results indicated that DOM from the rhizosphere of both ecotypes of S. alfredii had the ability to form complexes with Zn, whereas the degree of complexation was significantly higher for HE-DOM (60%) than NHE-DOM (42%). The addition of HE-DOM significantly (P < 0.05) increased the solubility of four Zn minerals while NHE-DOM was not as effective at the same concentration. It was concluded that DOM derived from the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulating ecotype of S. alfredii could significantly increase Zn mobility through the formation of soluble DOM-metal complexes, this might be one of the important mechanism by which S. alfredii is involved in activating metal in rhizosphere.

Abiotic solubilization of soil organic matter, a less-seen aspect of dissolved organic matter production	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a small but reactive pool of the soil organic matter (SOM) that contributes to soil dynamics including the intermediary pool spanning labile to resistant SOM fractions. The solubilization of SOM (DOM production) is commonly attributed to both microbially driven and physico-chemically mediated processes, yet the extent to which these processes control DOM production is highly debated. We conducted a series of experiments using C-13-ryegrass residue or its extract (C-13-ryegrass-DOM) separately under sterile and non-sterile conditions to demonstrate the importance of DOM production from microbial and physico-chemical processes. Soils with similar properties but differing in parent material were used to test the influence of mineralogy on DOM production. To test the role of the source of C for DOM production, one set of soils was leached frequently with C-13-ryegrass-DOM and in the other set of soils C-13-ryegrass residue was incorporated at the beginning of the experiment into the soil and soils were leached frequently with 0.01 mol L-1 CaCl2 solution. Leaching events for both treatments occurred at 12-d intervals over a 90-day period. The amount of dissolved organic C and N (DOC and DON) leached from residue-amended soils were consistently more than 3 times higher in sterile than non-sterile soils, decreasing with the time. Despite changes in the concentration of DOC and DON and the production of CO2, the proportion of DOC derived from the C-13-ryegrass residue was largely constant during the experiment (regardless of microbial activity), with the majority (about 70%) of the DOM originating from native SOM. In C-13-residue-DOM treatments, after successive leaching events and regardless of the sterility conditions i) the native SOM consistently supplied at least 10% of the total leached DOM, and ii) the contribution of native SOM to DOM was 2-2.9 times greater in C-13-residue-DOM amended soils than control soils, suggesting the role of desorption and exchange reactions in DOM production in presence of fresh DOM input. The contribution of the native SOM to DOM resulted in higher aromaticity and humification index. Our results suggest that physico-chemical processes (e.g. exchange or dissolution reactions) can primarily control DOM production. However, microbial activity affects SOM solubilization indirectly through DOM turnover. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Airborne Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for the Quantification of Dissolved Organic Matter Concentration in Natural Waters	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and composition is essential to quantifying biological and chemical oxygen demand and atmosphere-ocean heat flux exchange in natural waters. However, manual water sampling is costly and time consuming over large areas. The purpose of this research was to analyze the applicability of airborne laser-induced fluorescence light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for the detection of DOM in estuarine ecosystems impacted by agriculture. A fluorescence LiDAR system (Airborne Marine) (FLS-AM) was used to assess the DOM concentration of the Annapolis River and Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada, as well as three rivers and their estuaries in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Two FLS-AM flight missions were conducted in the summers of 2008 and 2009 and the resulting datasets were compared with spectral fluorescence signature (SFS DOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis of in situ water samples. Significant positive correlations were found at five of seven sites between the FLS-AM DOM and SFS DOM relationship which indicates that the FLS-AM sensor is a good surrogate for traditional sample collection of DOM data in estuaries in this region. Positive correlations were also found at all sites between FLS-AM DOM values and DOC. FLS-AM DOM patterns show that DOM values are significantly higher in rivers and estuaries that drain watersheds which are heavily impacted by agricultural practices. The results of this study show that the FLS-AM can be used efficiently as a general indicator for how estuaries are affected by runoff from agricultural watersheds in real time and thus reduce the requirement for traditional water sample collection and laboratory analysis methods.

Precipitation patterns, dissolved organic matter and changes in the plankton assemblage in Lake Escondido (Patagonia, Argentina)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Global warming affects the hydrological cycle by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events and dry spells. These changes potentially affect the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) input into lakes. In this study, we investigated if changes in precipitation over a 3-year period correspond to changes in DOM and whether these changes affect light attenuation and plankton community composition. We sampled Lake Escondido, a shallow, oligotrophic Andean lake, nine times, analyzing coloured DOM and plankton community composition. During the study period, we observed that variations in the precipitation regime correlated with DOM parameters (water colour and molecular weight), and this, in turn, affected the plankton composition. Chlorophyll a concentrations of both phytoplanktonic fractions (less than and greater than 2 mu m) were related to water colour and TDP. We observed in the small fraction (< 2 mu m) an increase in phycocyanin-rich cells during periods of high water colour. Larger phytoplanktonic cells (> 2 mu m) presented two biomass peaks corresponding to increases of the cyanophyte Chroococcus planctonicus and of the haptophyte Chrysochromulina parva. As precipitation decreased, the lake became more transparent, favouring C. planctonicus and mixotrophic oligotrich ciliates with endosymbiotic Chlorella. In the context of global climate change, our results highlight the potential impact of changes in precipitation patterns and, consequently, in DOM quality on the plankton community.																	0018-8158					JUL	2012	691	1					189	202		10.1007/s10750-012-1073-5						WOS:000304565100017		
J	Hong, HS; Yang, LY; Guo, WD; Wang, FL; Yu, XX				Hong, Huasheng; Yang, Liyang; Guo, Weidong; Wang, Fuli; Yu, Xiangxiang			Characterization of dissolved organic matter under contrasting hydrologic regimes in a subtropical watershed using PARAFAC model	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was characterized during five basin-scale investigations (either after storms or in droughts) in Jiulong River, China that is affected by the Asian Monsoon, tropical storms and anthropogenic activities. Dissolved organic carbon concentration, DOM absorption and fluorescence (excitation-emission matrix spectra, EEMs) were measured. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of EEMs identified three humic-like and two protein-like fluorescent components. DOM concentration was highest at two polluted stations in droughts while lowest in pristine headwaters (station N1). DOM concentration increased most evidently after storms in May, 2009, indicating effective flushing of DOM from land to the river close to the onset of flood season. The protein-like fraction in PARAFAC results decreased after storms in May and June, 2009, highlighting changes in DOM composition and thus its environmental role. Dam constructions likely increased the residence time of DOM in river, making the inflow of DOM during storms have more implications for the riverine (in comparison with estuarine) biogeochemical processes. The effect of storm in August, 2008 after intense DOM flushing during several preceding storms, was not evident. A severe dinoflagellate algal bloom occurred during the extreme drought in the lower watershed, which increased DOM concentration and the protein-like fraction at impacted stations. Different DOM compositions during and after algal bloom were discriminated using the two protein-like components. This study demonstrates the importance of hydrologic regimes and anthropogenic activities on freshwater DOM and its environmental role, which has implications for a number of other rivers that share similar characteristics.

We therefore have developed a simple cleanup procedure for freshwater samples with low nitrate and high DOM concentrations. METHODS Nitrate and DOM are extracted from a freeze-dried water sample by using a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. By the subsequent addition of acetone, two liquid layers are formed, and nitrate migrates into the acetone while DOM remains in the concentrated NaOH solution, thus separating the nitrate from the DOM. For nitrogen isotope analysis, purified nitrate salts are combusted at 1030 degrees C to produce N2 gas in an elemental analyzer (EA) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). RESULTS With this novel technique up to 99% of DOM could be removed from river water and soil solutions. The method has been tested for sample amounts as small as 4 mu mol NO3 with a precision of <0.1 parts per thousand (1SD). Nitrate standards are reproduced accurately without any blank correction. CONCLUSIONS The benefits of this method are the lack of interferences derived from DOM on the d15N signature and the ease of sample preparation. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In the present study, we determined the optical changes and the quantum yields of transient species formation for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) samples undergoing photodegradation. The results show that the triplet states (CDOM)-C-3* are potentially key players in CDOM photodegradation and that such transformations are strongly influenced by small differences in CDOM sources and sinks. In contrast, center dot OH radicals are very unlikely to play a key role in phototransformation. These results represent an important first step in combining optical and transient species analyses to understand photodegradation processes of dissolved organic matter. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidized sterols as a significant component of dissolved organic matter: Evidence from 2D HPLC in combination with 2D and 3D NMR spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												The elucidation of molecular structures present in dissolved organic matter (DOM) has the potential to unlock many of the queries associated with organic precursors, diagenetic processes and reactivity of this highly complex material. Suwannee River DOM was extensively fractionated by two dimensional hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)/HILIC and fractions were analyzed via a suite of two and three-dimensional NMR experiments. HILIC provided more greatly resolved fractions with a second dimension and enabled extensive and in-depth NMR analyses. The composite NMR experiments provide strong evidence for highly oxidized sterols as major structural components present in one of the most simplified and subsequently resolved fractions. Further interpretation of data on other fractions across the polarity gradient likewise supports the presence of alicyclic structures present with considerable hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids and methyl groups associated with quaternary carbon suggesting that further sterol- and hopanoid-type structures are potentially dominant throughout DOM.

Michael			Advanced Solid-State NMR Characterization of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter Isolated Using the Coupled Reverse Osmosis/Electrodialysis Method	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Advanced C-13 solid-state techniques were employed to investigate the major structural characteristics of two surface-seawater dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples isolated using the novel coupled reverse osmosis/electrodialysis method. The NMR techniques included quantitative C-13 direct polarization/magic angle spinning (DP/MAS) and DP/MAS with recoupled dipolar dephasing, C-13 cross-polarization/total sideband suppression (CP/TOSS), C-13 chemical shift anisotropy filter, CH, CH2, and CHn selection, two-dimensional H-1-C-13 heteronuclear correlation NMR (2D HETCOR), 2D HETCOR combined with dipolar dephasing, and N-15 cross-polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS). The two samples (Coastal and Marine DOM) were collected at the mouth of the Ogeechee River and in the Gulf Stream, respectively. The NMR results indicated that they were structurally distinct. Coastal DOM contained significantly more aromatic and carbonyl carbons whereas Marine DOM was markedly enriched in alkoxy carbon (e.g., carbohydrate-like moieties). Both samples contained significant amide N, but Coastal DOM had nitrogen bonded to aromatic carbons. Our dipolar-dephased spectra indicated that a large fraction of alkoxy carbons were not protonated. For Coastal DOM, our NMR results were consistent with the presence of the major structural units of (1) carbohydrate-like moieties, (2) lignin residues, (3) peptides or amino sugars, and (4) COO-bonded alkyls. For Marine DOM, they were (1) carbohydrate-like moieties, (2) peptides or amino sugars, and (3) COO-bonded alkyls. In addition, both samples contained significant amounts of nonpolar alkyl groups. The potential sources of the major structural units of DOM were discussed in detail. Nonprotonated O-alkyl carbon content was proposed as a possible index of humification.

In this study, two-dimensional (2D) FTIR correlation spectroscopy was developed as a novel tool to explore the binding of organic ligands with AI(III) in DOM present in soils as part of a long-term (21-year) fertilization experiment. The results showed that while it is a popular method for characterizing the binding of organic ligands and metals, fluorescence excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis can only characterize the binding characteristics of fluorescent substances (i.e., protein-, humic-, and fulvic-like substances) with Al(III). However, 2D FTIR correlation spectroscopy can characterize the binding characteristics of both fluorescent and non-fluorescent (i.e., polysaccharides, lipids, and lignin) substances with Al(III). Meanwhile, 2D FTIR correlation spectroscopy demonstrated that the sequencing/ordering of organics binding with Al(III) could be modified by the use of long-term fertilization strategies. Furthermore, 2D FTIR correlation spectroscopy revealed that the high SOC content in the chemical plus manure (NPKM) treatment in the long term fertilization experiment can be attributed to the formation of noncrystalline microparticles (i.e., allophane and imogolite). In summary, 2D FTIR correlation spectroscopy is a promising approach for the characterization of metal-organic complexes.

First spectroscopic study on the structural features of dissolved organic matter isolated from rainwater in different seasons	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The complexity of rainwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the large percentage considered uncharacterized has made it difficult to determine the role of rainwater DOM in regional and global carbon budgets. Recent studies have concentrated on determining the structural characteristics of the bulk DOM in rainwater, but a comparison between the structural characteristics of rainwater DOM from different seasons is lacking. In this work. DOM was extracted from rainwater collected in different seasons by a procedure based on adsorption onto DAX-8 resin and a comparison between the spectroscopic characteristics of extracted DOM was performed using UV-visible, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and H-1 NMR spectroscopies. Similar structural characteristics were observed for extracted DOM from the different seasons: high content of aliphatic structures, hydroxy and alkoxy groups, carbonyl groups and unsaturated carbon atoms, and low content of aromatic structures when compared with aliphatic structures. The obtained results suggest a model of chemical structures for the extracted DOM from rainwater, as consisting mainly of aliphatic chains, with COOH, -CH2OH, -COCH3, or -CH3 terminal groups, and with only a minor aromatic component. Moreover, this study suggests that the DOM extracted from rainwater has higher aliphatic character and lower aromatic content than aquatic humic substances. Thus, the chemical characteristics of aquatic humic substances may not be good models for DOM extracted from rainwater. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous consumption and production of fluorescent dissolved organic matter by lake bacterioplankton	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Recent evidence suggests a key role of bacterioplankton in shaping the composition of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool in aquatic systems, not only through consumption but also through production of specific compounds, but the latter process is still not well understood. We used a bioassay approach to assess the patterns in bacterial production and consumption of five fluorescent DOM pools in seven lakes and two streams in Southeastern Quebec, Canada, and the links these patterns may have with key aspects of bacterial metabolism, DOM origin and nutrients availability. Total dissolved organic C declined by 315% during these incubations, whereas the specific DOM pools had very different dynamics: Two humic-like fractions accumulated in all incubations, with rates of production increasing as a function of bacterial growth efficiency, which itself increased with phosphorus concentrations. In contrast, two protein-like fractions and a third humic-like fraction either increased or declined over the course of the experiments. The net production or consumption of these pools appeared to be a function of the contribution of terrestrial C to bulk DOM (derived from d13C of the DOM) and of total bacterial activity. Our results suggest that lake bacterioplankton play a dual role in DOM dynamics, as consumers and also producers, and that the interplay between DOM origin and nutrient availability appears to determine the net outcome of bacterial DOM processing, thus influencing the bulk DOM composition and its fate in these aquatic systems.																	1462-2912					JUN	2012	14	6					1432	1443		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02728.x						WOS:000304866600007	22429445

The results showed that fulvic-like, tryptophan-like and humic acids-like matters were the main compounds in landfill leachate. A number of UV fulvic-like matters led to ineffective biodegradation of leachate. HOA contained more UV fulvic-like and less Vis fulvic-like, by contrary to HIA; HIN was mainly composed of UV fulvic-like and Vis fulvic-like matters; HOB, HIB and HIN had more intense fluorescence signal, whose fluorescence peaks occurred in the region of fulvic-like, tryptophan-like and humic acids-like. This was similar to the original leachate as well as HON which had relatively weak fluorescence signal. Moreover, different fractions had different fluorescence signal intensity in different regions. HOB and HIB had more intense signal in the region of UV fulvic-like. HIN had more intense signal in the region of UV fulvic-like and Vis fulvic-like. HON had moderately intense signal in the whole region. HOA and HIA had relatively weak fluorescence signal.																	1000-0593					JUN	2012	32	6					1575	1579		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2012)06-1575-05						WOS:000305044100028

Here we report the absorption and fluorescence properties of DOM released by a medusa species Black fordia virginica during a 24 h incubation experiment. Compared with the control group, an obvious increase in the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), absorption coefficient (a(280)) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) was observed in incubation group. This clearly demonstrated the release of DOM, chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and dissolved nutrients by B. virginica which feed on enough of Anemia sp. before the experiment. The increase in spectral slope ratio (SR) and decrease in humification index (HIX) indicated that the released D()M was less-humified and had relatively lower molecular weight. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) decomposed the fluorescence matrices of DOM into three humic-like components (C1-C3) and one protein-like component (C4). The F-max of two components (C2: <250, 295/386 nm; C4: 275/334 nm) with the emission wavelength <400 nm increased significantly during the metabolic process of B. virginica. However, the F-max of the other two components with the emission wavelength >400 nm showed little changes. Thus, we suggested a zooplankton index (ZIX) to trace and characterize the DOM excreted by metabolic activity of zooplankton, which is calculated as the ratio of the sum of F-max of all fluorescence components with the emission wavelength <400 nm to the sum of F-max of the other components with the emission wavelength >400 nm.

We studied how dissolved organic matter (DOM) in forest floors responded to six years of litter fall manipulation at a spruce site. Experimental treatments included (i) ambient litter fall, as well as (ii) reduction or (iii) increase of litter fall, each by 80%. Reduced litter input did not change fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which suggests that much of the mobile DOM in forest floors is not from recent litter but older, partly degraded material. Litter addition increased DOC fluxes over 6 years by 68% (Oi), 23% (Oe) and 12% (Oa). This was mainly due to excessive DOM production in Oi horizons, while net DOM production in Oe and Oa horizons decreased. Upon litter addition, aromaticity and molecule complexity of DOM released from the Oi horizon increased, but decreased for DOM leaving Oa horizons. The results suggest that DOM production by lignin degradation was enhanced in Oi but reduced in Oe and Oa horizons upon litter addition. Recent litter is not an important source for DOM entering mineral soils, but increased litter input changes organic matter decomposition, thus affecting fluxes and properties of DOM within forest floors.

Daniel; Qiu, Yuping			Reduced adsorption of propanil to black carbon: Effect of dissolved organic matter loading mode and molecule size	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												In the present study, the reduced adsorption of propanil on black carbon (BC) influenced by dissolved organic matter (DOM) was verified to be closely related to DOM molecule size and loading mode. Two congenetic carbons, a rice-residuederived BC and the reduced product (RC), were characterized by similar specific surface area and different surface properties. Reduced product exhibits higher adsorption of propanil and DOM than BC. A series of model DOMs, including tannic acid (TA), pentagalloylglucose (PA), 3-O-galloylmucic acid (OA), and gallic acid (GA), characterized by different molecule sizes and molecular weights, were used to evaluate the different inhibitory effects. The DOM adsorption (mmol/g) on BC and RC follows the order of GA>PA>OA>TA, whereas the reduction of propanil adsorption influenced by the model DOM follows the order of PA approximate to TA>OA approximate to GA. The suppressive degree is connected to their molecule sizes rather than to molecular weights. Tannic acid and PA weakened propanil adsorption more effectively than OA and GA because the large DOM molecules may hinder propanil molecules into the micropore regions. Because of the similar molecule size, TA and PA present a similar suppressive effect on propanil adsorption. The influence of the DOMs was greater when preloaded than when in competition with propanil. The preloading of macromolecules (TA and PA) and OA on the carbons may lead to secondary and primary micropore blocks, respectively. The preloading of GA may cause partial GA molecule sequestration in the primary micropore, thus leading to strong attenuation of propanil adsorption on the carbons. Environ. Toxicol.

In this study, we evaluated the relative importance to DOM character of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM inputs and photo-degradation in a large, pristine wetland, the Okavango Delta of Botswana. We performed an intensive spatial sampling of surface water and analyzed for chemical and physical parameters (pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen saturation, temperature, and channel depth), dissolved organic matter (DOM), and particulate organic matter (POM). We used UV-vis absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy, and parallel factor analysis of excitation emission matrix data (EEM-PARAFAC) to characterize DOM. Our findings from principal component analysis (PCA) show downstream changes in DOM chemistry to be dominated by photo-degradation, suggesting that DOM in the Okavango Delta is transformed photo-chemically in shallower downstream reaches after being mobilized from the permanent swamp and seasonal floodplains. Additionally, we found that the PARAFAC model developed for the Everglades, a large, anthropogenically-altered wetland in North America, was well suited to tracking DOM dynamics in the Okavango Delta and may be useful for characterizing DOM in other sub-tropical, seasonally flooded wetlands.

Characterization and treatment of dissolved organic matter from oilfield produced waters	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been studied intensively in streams, lakes and oceans due to its role in the global carbon cycle and because it is a precursor of carcinogenic disinfection by-products in drinking water; however, relatively little research has been conducted on DOM in oilfield produced waters. In this study, recovery of DOM from two oilfield produced waters was relatively low (similar to 34%), possibly due to the presence of high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A van Krevelen diagram of the extracted DOM suggested the presence of high concentrations of lipids, lignin, and proteins, but low concentrations of condensed hydrocarbons. Most of the compounds in the oilfield DOM contained sulfur in their structures. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated the presence of methyl groups, amides, carboxylic acids, and aromatic compounds, which is in agreement with results of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) analysis. Qualitatively, DOM in oilfield produced waters is similar to that reported in oceans and freshwater, except that it contains much more sulfur and is less aromatic. Treatment studies conducted in a fluidized bed reactor suggested that volatilization of organics may be a more important mechanism of DOM removal than microbial degradation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Simulating streamflow and dissolved organic matter export from a forested watershed	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Stream water concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exhibit large temporal variations during precipitation on forested, headwater catchments. We present a modeling framework appropriate for describing streamflow and event-driven export of DOM from small, forested watersheds. Our model links parametrically simple formulations for rainfall-runoff generation and soil water carbon dynamics. The rainfall-runoff formulation is developed by modifying the catchment model of Kirchner (2009) to account for hysteresis in the relationship between stream discharge and catchment water storage. Time series computations of catchment water storage are used by the soil carbon model to approximate the effects of leaching, adsorption, and mineralization on soil water DOM concentrations and the export of DOM from the terrestrial reservoir to the stream. Our findings show that this model is capable of reproducing hourly variations of stream discharge (ranging from 0.01 to 0.38 mm h(-1)) and stream water DOM concentrations (ranging from 1.8 to 14 mg C L-1) measured in a forested headwater stream in north central Massachusetts. Our analysis highlights the strong linkage between soil carbon dynamics and hydrological processes that govern catchment water storage and flow paths connecting the terrestrial system to the stream.

Results of three-dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) showed that humic substances derived from human activities (i.e., anthropogenic humic-like substances) were of higher biodegradation potentials than terrestrial and microbial humic-like substances. In addition, the biodegradation finally led to an increase of the percentage contribution of fluorescent DOM to the total DOM. Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy indicated that large amounts of the structural components of the DOM were removed within 3 h of biodegradation. Characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further revealed that the riverine DOM contained various functional groups that underwent different biotransformation mechanisms. The XPS data also indicated the appearance of newly generated, oxygen-rich functional groups upon biodegradation and the disappearance of nitrogen-containing groups as a result of hydrolysis and nitrification of organic and/or ammonium nitrogen.

J	Kiikkila, O; Kitunen, V; Smolander, A				Kiikkila, Oili; Kitunen, Veikko; Smolander, Aino			Chemical and biological characterization of dissolved organic matter derived from Norway spruce litter divided into fractions according to molecular size	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from the litter layer under Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst) was separated into different molecular size fractions (<1, 1-10,10-100, and >100 kDa) with tangential ultrafiltration technique. The chemical characteristics of the molecular size fractions were studied. The degradability of size fractions was assessed as the degradability of DOC and availability of a fraction to soil bacteria and fungi. The molecular size fractions appeared to differ chemically and microbiologically. The smallest molecular size fraction had the highest pH and lowest DOC/DON ratio. The two smallest molecular size fractions contained more carbohydrates and phenolic compounds than the two largest fractions. In all fractions DOC was degraded. The smallest fraction was the most degradable. It had the highest evolution of CO2-C and loss of DOC during the incubation and the highest estimated proportion of labile DOC. The NPK addition increased the evolution of CO2 in the total solution and in all fractions indicating nutrient shortage in all fractions. The smallest molecular size fraction was the most available to soil bacteria and the least available to soil fungi. Due to observed differences between the molecular size fractions tangential ultrafiltration may be useful in characterizing DOM. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

While their functions and refractoriness depend on the physicochemical structure, there is little information on the quality of CDOM, especially for that leached in the very early stages of litter decomposition when a large amount of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is leached. This study aimed to better understand the variations/changes in the composition of CDOM leached from senescent leaf litter from two tree species during the early stage of decomposition. Leaf litter from a conifer tree (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) and a deciduous broad-leaved tree (Konara oak, Quercus serrata Thunb.) were incubated in columns using simulated rainfall events periodically for a total of 300 d at 20 degrees C. The quality of CDOM was investigated based on the fluorescence properties by using a combination of excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEM) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). In addition, the phenolic composition of DOM was investigated at a molecular level by thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (THM-GC-MS) in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The EEM was statistically decomposed into eight fluorescence components (two tannin/peptide-like peaks, one protein-like peak, and five humic-like peaks). A significant contribution of tannin/peptide-like peaks was observed at the beginning of incubation, but these peaks decreased quickly and humic-like peaks increased within 1 mo of incubation. The composition of humic-like peaks was different between tree species and changed over the incubation period. Since tannin-derived phenolic compounds were detected in the DOM collected after 254 d of incubation on THM-GC-MS, it was suggested that tannins partially changed its structure, forming various humic-like peaks during the early decomposition.																	0047-2425					MAY-JUN	2012	41	3					823	833		10.2134/jeq2011.0342						WOS:000303901100022	22565264

The effect of surface irradiance on the absorption spectrum of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the global ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The cycling pathways of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) within marine systems must be constrained to better assess the impact of CDOM on surface ocean photochemistry and remote sensing of ocean color. Photobleaching, the loss of absorption by CDOM due to light exposure, is the primary sink for marine CDOM. Herein the susceptibility of CDOM to photobleaching by sea surface-level solar radiation was examined in 15 samples collected from wide-ranging open ocean regimes. Samples from the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans were irradiated over several days with full-spectrum light under a solar simulator at in situ temperature in order to measure photobleaching rate and derive an empirical matrix, epsilon(surf) (m(-1) mu Ein(-1)), which quantifies the effect of surface irradiance on the spectral absorption of CDOM. Irradiation responses among the ocean samples were similar within the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum spanning 300-360 nm, generally exhibiting a decrease in the CDOM absorption coefficient (m(-1)) and concomitant increase in the CDOM spectral slope parameter, S (nm(-1)). However, an unexpected irradiation-induced increase in CDOM absorption between approximately 360 and 500 nm was observed for samples from high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) environments. This finding was linked to the presence of dissolved nitrate and may explain discrepancies in action spectra for dimethylsulfide (DMS) photobleaching observed between the Equatorial Pacific and Subtropical North Atlantic Oceans. The nitrate-to-phosphate ratio explained 27-70% of observed variability in epsilon(surf) at observation wavelengths of 330-440 nm, while the initial spectral slope of the samples explained up to 52% of variability in epsilon(surf) at observation wavelengths of 310-330 nm. These results suggest that the biogeochemical and solar exposure history of the water column, each of which influence the chemical character and thus the spectral quality of CDOM and its photoreactivity, are the main factors regulating the susceptibility of CDOM to photodegradation in the surface ocean. The epsilon(surf) parameter reported herein may be applied to remote sensing retrievals of CDOM to estimate photobleaching at the surface on regional to global scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, QK; Zhong, MC; Wang, SL				Wang, Qingkui; Zhong, Micai; Wang, Silong			A meta-analysis on the response of microbial biomass, dissolved organic matter, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil to fire in forest ecosystems	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The effects of fire on labile soil C and N in forest ecosystems are important for understanding C sequestration and N cycling not only because labile soil C and N are often variables that determine soil fertility but also because the role of soils as a source or sink for C is important on an ecosystem and on the regional level. In the current study, the literature on the effects of fire on soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C, and total N, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil was reviewed, and the results of a meta-analysis on literature data were reported. Overall, fire significantly increased the soil total N, microbial biomass N. dissolved organic C, and total N, but decreased soil organic C, microbial biomass C, respiration and N mineralization. Among the significant effects of different fire types, wildfire had the higher effects on the soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved total N and respiration of soil than prescribed fire. In addition, responses of soil organic C. total N and N mineralization to wildfire depended on forest type and natural zone. Positive responses of soil organic C, total N were found in broadleaved forests and Mediterranean zones, and negative responses in coniferous forests and temperate zones. Wildfire significantly decreased N mineralization in coniferous forests. The effects of fire on soil microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N mineralization generally decreased with time after the fire. In general, the effects of fire on soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and dissolved total N and N mineralization decreased with increasing soil depth. These results suggest that fire increases C and N availability and increases microbial activity, which consequently decreases the potential rates of C sequestration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the interaction of bisphenol A (BPA) with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and colloids present in surface water and secondary effluent as well as its adsorptive removal by powdered activated carbons. The solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) method followed by thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized for determining the distribution of BPA molecules in water. The BPA removal by SPME decreased with the increased DOM content, where the formation of BPA-DOM complexes in an aqueous matrix was responsible for the reduced extraction of BPA. Colloidal particles in water samples sorbed BPA leading to the marked reduction of liquid phase BPA. BPA-DOM complexes had a negative impact on the adsorptive removal of BPA by powered activated carbons. The complex formation was characterized based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, along with the calculation of molecular interactions between BPA and functional groups in DOM. It was found that the hydrogen bonding between DOM and BPA would be preferred over aromatic interactions. A pseudo-equilibrium molecular coordination model for the complexation between a BPA molecule and a hydroxyl group of the DOM was developed, which enabled estimation of the maximum sorption site and complex formation constant as well as prediction of organic complexes at various DOM levels.

Standard DOM, namely humic acid, fulvic acid and hydrophilic acid, from the Suwannee River were tested to ascertain the performance and sensitivity of the method. In addition to four compounds groups: humic substances (Peak 1, AMW 16 kD), fulvic acids (Peak 2, AMW 11 kD), low AMW acids (Peak 3, AMW 5 kD), and low AMW neutral and amphiphilic molecules, proteins and their amino acid building blocks (Peak 4, AMW 3 kD), an new group that appears to include low AMW, 6-10 kD, humic substances was found based on investigating the spectra at various elution times. The spectroscopic parameter S->365 (slope at wavelengths >365 nm) was determined to be a good predictor of the AMW of the DOM. The detector wavelength played an important role in evaluating the AMW distribution. For some fractions, such as the humic and low AMW non-aromatic substances, the error in measurement was +/- 30% as determined by two-dimensional chromatograms detected at an artificially selected wavelength. HPLC-SEC with multiple wavelength absorbance detection was found to be a useful technique for DOM characterization. It characterized the AMW distributions of DOM more accurately and provided additional, potentially important information concerning the properties of DOM with varying AMWs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

DOM is often considered to be a major ligand for metals in most natural waters and its reactivity is thought to be strongly dependent on its chemical composition and structure. In this study, a combination of UV/visible, emission excitation matrix fluorescence (EEM) and H-1 NMR spectroscopies were used to characterize DOM from the Athabasca River (Alberta, Canada). The chemical characterization of river DOM showed that the most upstream samples located in agricultural areas were blue-shifted and less aromatic and contained more hydrogens connected with oxygen functional groups than those in the wetland dominated area in the Athabasca oil sand deposit region. The presence of paramagnetic ions (Fe and Al) was not found to significantly affect the structural composition of DOM as revealed by H-1 NMR. Such change in the quality of DOM may have a profound impact on metal binding in the Athabasca River watershed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study thus investigated how root-induced changes in pH and dissolved organic matters (DOM) altered copper (Cu) dynamic speciation in the rhizosphere of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum L.). Plants were exposed to a Cu-contaminated soil previously alkalised by liming to cover soil pH values ranging from 4.8 to 7.5. A range of analytical techniques was deployed on soil exposed (i.e. in the rhizosphere) or not (i.e. in the bulk soil) to plant roots, including the measurement and the modelling (using the Humic Ion-Binding Model VI) of Cu2+ activity, the measurement of labile Cu concentration and Cu lability by Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (DPASV) and Diffusive Gradients in Thin films (DGT). Due to root-induced alkalisation, pH reached about 7.3 in the rhizosphere whatever the initial bulk soil pH. Compared to the most acidic bulk soil (pH approximate to 4.8), Cu2+ activity decreased by three orders of magnitude in the rhizosphere while DPASV-Cu concentration decreased by 6-fold. DOM became the key driver of Cu dynamic speciation in the rhizosphere, where roots induced up to an order of magnitude increase in DOM concentration compared to bulk soils. This resulted in an increase in labile-Cu (both DPASV and DGT) concentrations, in spite of a decrease in Cu2+ activity. Model VI calculations supported a decrease in DOM binding capacity towards Cu in the rhizosphere. DPASV measurements unequivocally demonstrated that the increase in Cu lability in the rhizosphere solution can be attributed to a greater lability of organically-bound Cu. Collectively, our data introduce a consistent picture of root-induced changes of Cu dynamic speciation in the rhizosphere that were notably related to substantial alterations of DOM binding capacity.

Solid phase extraction (SUE) operating in column and batch modes was used as an extractive technique, and the latter mode offered better performance. DOM adsorption was achieved using 60 mg of MWCNTs per each 250 mL of seawater subsample, working at pH 1.0 and under an orbital-horizontal shaking at 180 rpm and 25 degrees C for 4 h. DOM desorption from the MWCNTs support implied an orbital-horizontal shaking (180 rpm and 25 degrees C) for 2 It using 10 mL of a 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution (DOM determination), or using 20 mL of alkaline methanol (pH 10.0) for DOM fractionation by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with UV detection at 205 nm. A Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer with wet DOM oxidation (30% (m/v) potassium peroxodisulphate in 6.0 M phosphoric acid) under super critical conditions and with Non-Dispersive Infra Red (NDIR) for CO2 detection was used for DOM measurements. Calibration covered TOC concentrations within the 0.13-1000 mg L-1 range. The percentage of DOM retained in the MWCNTs support was dependent on the seawater sample, and it varied from 34 to 81%. This means that only the DOM of certain molecular weights is capable to interact with the SUE support. Various SEC columns, ranging from 100 to 7000 and from 500 to 15,000 Da (optimum separation range for peptides), were therefore used for DOM fractionation. Results have shown that DOM of low molecular weight is retained in the MWCNTs (fractions within the ranges of 125-1102 Da and 6.88-125 Da). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DOM has several different fluorophores whose fluorescent characteristics contain a lot of information about structure and functional groups. Fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared (FIR) were used to examine the structural and biodegradable characteristics of DOM extracted from fermentation effluent of swine manure slurry. Humic-like acid, fulvic-like acid and protein-like fluorophores were observed in fluorescence spectra. Fluorescence index (FI) indicated that the fluorophores in the samples were representative of both terrestrial and microbially-derived organic matter. FTIR spectroscopy showed that DOM featured aliphatic C H, aromatic C=C and carbohydrate C-O functional groups. With PARAFAC model, four fluorescent components were identified: component 1 (protein-like), component 2 (soluble microbial byproduct-like), component 3 (non-humic like) and component 4 (fulvic-like). Component 1 was a dominant fluorescent component. Components 2, 3 and 4 were degraded by microorganisms as the anaerobic fermentation processes. The C/N ratio of DOM in F1 has a more significant decrease than that in F0, indicating the loss of carbon (CH4 and CO2) during this process. The C/N ratio of DOM in F2 obviously increased when additional swine manure slurry was added. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

J	Granskog, MA				Granskog, Mats A.			Changes in spectral slopes of colored dissolved organic matter absorption with mixing and removal in a terrestrially dominated marine system (Hudson Bay, Canada)	MARINE CHEMISTRY												We investigated the changes in absorption and spectral slopes of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) using a data set of salinity, delta O-18 and CDOM absorption in Hudson Bay. Following the fraction of river water (determined with salinity and delta O-18 tracers) one can track the changes in terrestrial CDOM optical properties with mixing and removal, as salinity cannot alone be used in waters with significant influence from sea-ice melt. CDOM in Hudson Bay was controlled by terrestrial inputs, in contrast to adjacent Hudson Strait. CDOM absorption was removed significantly, likely due to photobleaching. There was no or negligible indication of absorption removal during initial estuarine mixing, in agreement with earlier studies. Of the many absorption spectral slope (S) parameters that have been used as proxies for CDOM dynamics, the ones at shorter wavelengths proved the best indicators for absorption removal by photobleaching. Increase in absorption spectral slopes at 275 to 295 (S275-295) and 290 to 350 nm (S290-350) are strongly correlated with the apparent removal of CDOM absorption. S275-295 and S290-350 in combination with spectral slopes and ratios at other wavelength intervals, which are sensitive to other processes and sources, can potentially reveal more information about CDOM origin and dynamics than a single slope alone.

J	Riedel, T; Biester, H; Dittmar, T				Riedel, Thomas; Biester, Harald; Dittmar, Thorsten			Molecular Fractionation of Dissolved Organic Matter with Metal Salts	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Coagulation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by hydrolyzing metals is an important environmental process with particular relevance, e.g., for the cycling of organic matter in metal-rich aquatic systems or the flocculation of organic matter in wastewater treatment plants. Often, a nonremovable fraction of DOM remains in solution even at low DOM/metal ratios. Because coagulation by metals results from interactions with functional groups, we hypothesize that noncoagulating fractions have a distinct molecular composition. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed peat-derived dissolved organic matter remaining in solution after mixing with salts of Ca, Al, and Fe using 15 T Electrospray Ionization Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Addition of metals resulted in a net removal of DOM. Also a reduction of molecular diversity was observed, as the number of peaks from the ESI-FT-ICR-MS spectra decreased. At DOM/metal ratios of similar to 9 Ca did not show any preference for distinct molecular fractions, while Fe and Al removed preferentially the most oxidized compounds (O/C ratio >0.4) of the peat leachate. Lowering DOM/metal ratios to similar to 1 resulted in further removal of less oxidized as well as more aromatic compounds ("black carbon"). Molecular composition in the residual solution after coagulation was more saturated, less polar, and less oxidized compared to the original peat leachate and exhibited a surprising similarity with DOM of marine origin. By identifying more than 9200 molecular formulas we can show that structural properties (saturation and aromaticity) and oxygen content of individual DOM molecules play an important role in coagulation with metals. We conclude that polyvalent cations not only alter the net mobility but also the very molecular composition of DOM in aquatic environments.

Alkaline Earth Metal Cation Exchange: Effect of Mobile Counterion and Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The goal of this research was to provide an improved understanding of the interactions between alkaline earth metals and DOM under conditions that are encountered during drinking water treatment with particular focus on cation exchange. Both magnetically enhanced and nonmagnetic cation exchange resins were converted to Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba mobile counterion forms as a novel approach to investigate the exchange behavior between the cations and the interactions between the cations and DOM. The results show that cation exchange is a robust process for removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ considering competition with cations on the resin surface and presence of DOM. DOM was actively involved during the cation exchange process through complexation, adsorption, and coprecipitation reactions. In addition to advancing the understanding of ion exchange processes for water treatment, the results of this work are applicable to membrane pretreatment to minimize fouling, treatment of membrane concentrate, and precipitative softening.

Colored dissolved organic matter absorption retrieval	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Eight autonomous profiling "Bio-Argo" floats were deployed offshore during about 2 years (2008-2010) in Pacific, Atlantic, and Mediterranean zones. They were equipped with miniaturized bio-optical sensors, namely a radiometer measuring within the upper layer the downward irradiance at 412, 490, and 555 nm, and two fluorometers for detection of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM; profiles from 400 m to surface). A first study dealt with the interpretation of the Chla fluorescence signal in terms of concentration, using for this purpose the diffuse attenuation coefficient for irradiance at 490 nm, K-d(490), taken as a proxy for the Chla absorption. The present study examines the possibility of similarly using the K-d(412) values combined with retrieved Chla profiles to convert the CDOM fluorometric qualitative information into a CDOM absorption coefficient (a(y)). The rationale is to take advantage of the fact that K-d is more sensitive to CDOM presence at 412 nm than at 490 nm. A validation of this method is tested through its application to field data, collected from a ship over a wide range of trophic conditions (Biogeochemistry and Optics South Pacific Experiment (BIOSOPE) cruise); these data include both in situ fluorescence profiles and CDOM absorption as measured on discrete samples. In addition, near-surface a(y) values retrieved from the floats agree with those derivable from ocean color imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-A)). The low sensitivity of commercially available CDOM fluorometers presently raises difficulties when applying this technique to open ocean waters. It was nevertheless possible to derive from the floats records meaningful time series of CDOM vertical distribution.

Our results from 21-day laboratory incubations in rotating glass bottles (roller bottles) demonstrate that microbial dynamics and carbon flux in oil-contaminated surface water sampled near the spill site two weeks after the onset of the blowout were greatly affected by activities of microbes associated with macroscopic oil aggregates. Roller bottles with oil-amended water showed rapid formation of oil aggregates that were similar in size and appearance compared to oil aggregates observed in surface waters near the spill site. Oil aggregates that formed in roller bottles were densely colonized by heterotrophic bacteria, exhibiting high rates of enzymatic activity (lipase hydrolysis) indicative of oil degradation. Ambient waters surrounding aggregates also showed enhanced microbial activities not directly associated with primary oil-degradation (beta-glucosidase; peptidase), as well as a twofold increase in DOC. Concurrent changes in fluorescence properties of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) suggest an increase in oil-derived, aromatic hydrocarbons in the DOC pool. Thus our data indicate that oil aggregates mediate, by two distinct mechanisms, the transfer of hydrocarbons to the deep sea: a microbially-derived flux of oil-derived DOC from sinking oil aggregates into the ambient water column, and rapid sedimentation of the oil aggregates themselves, serving as vehicles for oily particulate matter as well as oil aggregate-associated microbial communities.

Molecular Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter in Glacial Ice: Coupling Natural Abundance H-1 NMR and Fluorescence Spectroscopy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Glaciers and ice sheets are the second largest freshwater reservoir in the global hydrologic cycle, and the onset of global climate warming has necessitated an assessment of their contributions to sea-level rise and the potential release of nutrients to nearby aquatic environments. In particular, the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from glacier melt could stimulate microbial activity in both glacial ecosystems and adjacent watersheds, but this would largely depend on the composition of the material released. Using fluorescence and H-1 NMR spectroscopy, we characterize DOM at its natural abundance in unaltered samples from a number of glaciers that differ in geographic location, thermal regime, and sample depth. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling of DOM fluorophores identifies components in the ice that are predominantly proteinaceous in character, while H-1 NMR spectroscopy reveals a mixture of small molecules that likely originate from native microbes. Spectrofluorescence also reveals a terrestrial contribution that was below the detection limits of NMR; however, H-1 nuclei From levoglucosan was identified in Arctic glacier ice samples. This study suggests that the bulk of the DOM from these glaciers is a mixture of biologically labile molecules derived from microbes.																	0013-936X					APR 3	2012	46	7					3753	3761		10.1021/es203942y						WOS:000302850400023	22385100

During the biologic degradation process, the low molecular weight (MW) fraction (< 1 kDa) gradually decreased, while the refractory compounds with higher aromaticity were aggregated. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorescence of excitation emission matrices (EEM) demonstrated that more biopolymers (polysaccharides or proteins) and humic-like substances were presented in the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) extracted from the SBR fed with sodium acetate or glucose, while the EPS from SBR fed with slowly biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) substrate-starch had relatively less biopolymers. Comparing the EfOM in sewage effluent of three SBRs, the effluent from SBR fed with starch is more aromatic. Organic carbon with MW > 1 kDa as well as the hydrophobic fraction in DOM gradually increased with the carbon sources changing from sodium acetate to glucose and starch. The DOC fractionation and the EEM all demonstrated that EfOM from the effluent of the SBR fed with starch contained more fulvic acid-like substances comparing with the SBR fed with sodium acetate and glucose.				guo, jianhua/B-1114-2012	guo, jianhua/0000-0002-4732-9175												2095-2201					APR	2012	6	2					280	287		10.1007/s11783-011-0336-0						WOS:000304713300017

Short term temporal variability in the photochemically mediated alteration of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in rainwater	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The goal of the research presented here was to determine the impact of photochemistry on the abundance and spectral qualities of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in precipitation. The relationship between sunlight and CDOM in rainwater was complex with both production and photobleaching of optical properties occurring simultaneously in different regions of the fluorescence excitation emission spectra (EEMs) over relatively short time scales. Spectral slope was inversely correlated with the observed changes in total integrated fluorescence suggesting that photo-induced modifications in the molecular weight of CDOM were occurring along with fluctuations in its optical properties. Atmospheric condensate collected near a high traffic roadway had a response to sunlight similar to authentic rainwater suggesting some fraction of the CDOM in atmospheric waters is derived from local anthropogenic gas phase sources. There was a dramatic increase in fluorescence in two samples photolyzed with photosynthetically active radiation only (PAR; 400-700 nm) compared to analogous samples exposed to full spectrum sunlight indicating that this less energetic light is capable of producing photochemically labile compounds in rainwater. The observed temporal variability in the molecular level response of CDOM to sunlight is important because it may alter the spectral attenuation and the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface.

The identified components in different seasons were almost similar, including humic-like components C1 (265/440 nm), C2(410 similar to 450/520 similar to 550 nm) and protein-like component C3(230, 280/330 nm), and the good linearity proved that they had the same sources or some relationships. Furthermore, all of the 3 components in different water layers and different seasons showed higher fluorescence intensity around the Zhangzi island. The relationships of the 3 components with chlorophyll-a and salinity were discussed, and the results showed that DOM in the study area depended on phytoplankton and the input from human activities.

Punctual and continuous estimation of transit time from dissolved organic matter fluorescence properties in karst aquifers, application to groundwaters of 'Fontaine de Vaucluse' experimental basin (SE France)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												For about 10 years, environmental tracing development using dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been the subject of several studies. Particularly, the use of characterization techniques, like fluorescence emission-excitation matrices has enabled the identification of DOM sources and monitoring them within mainland or marine hydrosystems. Moreover, hydrogeologists have shown the significance of total organic carbon content used as a fast seepage tracer in karstic aquifers. The aim of this study consists in using DOM fluorescence signals to develop a transit time semi-quantitative tracer in heterogeneous hydrosystems. The Low-Noise Underground Laboratory (Vaucluse, France) cuts the network of Fontaine de Vaucluse (FV) karstic vadose zone randomly, and offers a special access to different unstructured dripwaters, with different hydrodynamic behaviour, inside its galleries, i.e. not hierarchical as in natural caves. Previous long-term hydrodynamic and hydrochemical studies allowed the understanding of their hydrogeological behaviour and the estimation of mean transit times. That is why this site is adequate to develop new transit time tracers. After identification of the different DOM sources (i.e. lithic and rendzic leptosols), fluorescence intensities monitoring from soil leachates and dripwaters, for certain excitation-emission wavelength pairs, allowed the development of punctual transit time tracing, by spotting infiltration periods of fluorescent compounds, and monitoring their transfer within a hydrosystem. A fluorescence index (humification index) and the mean transit time of each gallery groundwater, stemmed from previous hydrodynamic and hydrochemical studies, allowed the calibration of a logarithmic relationship. This one allows the development of a continuous transit time tracing method that estimates transit times without long-term studies. It has been tested on two springs of FV catchment basin, providing transit time estimations for karstic hydrosystems that do not present a mixture between recent and pluriannual waters.

Bioaccumulation of waterborne Ni in Dreissena polymorpha: A stable isotope experiment to assess the effect of zinc, calcium, and dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The effect of Ca, Zn, and dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) on waterborne Ni accumulation was investigated in a freshwater mussel. An enriched stable metal isotope tracer was required to measure the Ni uptake rate accurately. Zebra mussels were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of 62Ni (from 0.5 to 8?mu g/L) for 48?h in media spiked with Ca, Zn, or dissolved NOM. The 62Ni uptake was inhibited by Ca (from 0.138?+/-?0.021 to 0.061?+/-?0.010?L/g/d for Ca concentrations ranging from 43 to 133?mg/L) and enhanced by Zn (from 0.051?+/-?0.006 to 0.109?+/-?0.007?L/g/d for Zn concentrations ranging from 6.6 to 38.3?mu g/L). The mechanisms behind the synergistic effect of Zn remain unclear, yet it can be hypothesized that Ni uptake is facilitated by Zn-dependent transport sites. To formalize the effects of Ca and Zn, a model was proposed to express the Ni uptake rate as a function of the mussels' filtration rate and of Ca and Zn concentrations. The 62Ni uptake increased at low NOM concentrations and decreased at higher concentrations. This could be explained by the influence of NOM on both the speciation of Ni and the filtration activity of mussels. At high NOM concentrations, a modification of the membrane's permeability might also have favored Ni uptake, although this was not clearly established in this study. Therefore, the effect of water composition on Ni bioavailability to zebra mussels cannot be predicted by competition and complexation models alone, because it also influences the animal's physiology.

Molecular characterisation of the dissolved organic matter of wastewater effluents by MSSV pyrolysis GC-MS and search for source markers	CHEMOSPHERE												Microscale sealed vessel pyrolysis (MSSVpy) was used to characterise the hydrophobic (HPO) and colloid (COL) fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the effluents (EFFs) of two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and several primary source waters (SWs). The EFFs showed a large range of anthropogenically sourced organics - including the metabolites of industrial chemicals (e.g., dioxanes, n- and sec-alkyl substituted benzenes and long chain alkyl phenols), pharmaceuticals (e.g., N- and S-heterocycies) and human waste (e.g., S- and N-organics, steranes/sterenes) - as well as high concentrations of alkyl aromatic and N-organic products (e.g., alkyl indoles, carbazoles and beta-carbolines) attributed to the treatment biota. Some anthropogenic chemicals are potentially toxic at even trace levels, whilst the N-organics may be precursors for toxic N-disinfection by-products. Much lower concentrations of just a few of the anthropogenic and N-organic products were detected by more traditional flash pyrolysis (Flash-py) of the EFF samples, reflecting the higher sensitivity of MSSVpy to many chemical functionalities. Few of these products were detected in the corresponding MSSVpy analysis of the SWs, but these samples did show relatively high abundances of lignin (e.g., alkylphenols) and carbohydrate (e.g., furans) derived products. Their lower EFF abundances are consistent with efficient removal by the water treatment procedures applied. Conversely, the detection of the anthropogenics in the treated EFFs reflects their general resistance to treatment. Their occurrence in the HPO fractions isolated by XAD resin separation suggests a potential relationship with the structurally stable macromolecular fraction of the DOM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Application of excitation emission matrix fluorescence monitoring in the assessment of spatial and seasonal drivers of dissolved organic matter composition: Sources and physical disturbance controls	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The environmental dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were characterized for a shallow, subtropical, seagrass-dominated estuarine bay, namely Florida Bay, USA. Large spatial and seasonal variations in DOM quantity and quality were assessed using dissolved organic C (DOC) measurements and spectrophotometric properties including excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Surface water samples were collected monthly for 2 years across the bay. DOM characteristics were statistically different across the bay, and the bay was spatially characterized into four basins based on chemical characteristics of DOM as determined by EEM-PARAFAC. Differences between zones were explained based on hydrology, geomorphology, and primary productivity of the local seagrass community. In addition, potential disturbance effects from a very active hurricane season were identified. Although the overall seasonal patterns of DOM variations were not significantly affected on a bay-wide scale by this disturbance, enhanced freshwater delivery and associated P and DOM inputs (both quantity and quality) were suggested as potential drivers for the appearance of algal blooms in high impact areas. The application of EEM-PARAFAC proved to be ideally suited for studies requiring high sample throughput methods to assess spatial and temporal ecological drivers and to determine disturbance-induced impacts in aquatic ecosystems.

Here, we examined the concentration and quality of DOM for ten watershed sources in a 12 ha forested catchment over a two-year period. DOM composition was evaluated for: throughfall, litter leachate, soil water (zero and tension), shallow and deep groundwater, stream water, hyporheic zone, and groundwater seeps. DOM quality was measured using a suite of optical indices including UV-visible absorbance and PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). DOM concentrations and quality displayed a pronounced trend across watershed sources. Surficial watershed sources had higher DOM concentrations and more humic-like DOM with higher molecular weight whereas deeper groundwater sources were rich in % protein-like fluorescence. The greater % contribution of protein-like fluorescence in groundwater suggested that a larger fraction of groundwater DOM may be bioavailable. DOM for wetland groundwater was more aromatic and humic-like than that at the well-drained riparian location. Principal component analyses (PCA) revealed that the differences in surficial watershed compartments were dictated by humic-like components while groundwater sources separated out by % protein-like fluorescence. Observations from optical indices did not provide any conclusive evidence for preferential association of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) with any particular DOM quality pools.

We investigated how pH affects light absorption by DOM with pH manipulation experiments and with data from two lake surveys. We hypothesized that: (1) light absorption and photobleaching of DOM would increase with increasing pH, and (2) as a result of photobleaching, molar absorption (i.e. light absorbance at 440 nm/dissolved organic carbon concentration) would decrease among lakes with increasing pH. In experiments with filtered lake water both initial light absorption and photobleaching rates increased at higher (i.e. more basic) pH along with a concomitant shift in the size of DOM toward larger colloidal materials measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM) revealed large colloidal to particulate-sized organic matter in alkaline relative to acidic treatments. In the lake surveys, molar absorption coefficients were negatively related to pH across gradients similar to the experiments. Our results are consistent with a conceptual model in which at low pH DOM polymers and colloids are condensed limiting exposure of chromophores to light; at higher pH, polymers and colloids are expanded exposing chromophores to light resulting in greater initial light absorption and faster photobleaching. Hence, water transparency, which is significantly controlled by DOM, is sensitive to environmental changes that influence the pH and chemical composition of inland waters.

Taking the pulse of snowmelt: in situ sensors reveal seasonal, event and diurnal patterns of nitrate and dissolved organic matter variability in an upland forest stream	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Highly resolved time series data are useful to accurately identify the timing, rate, and magnitude of solute transport in streams during hydrologically dynamic periods such as snowmelt. We used in situ optical sensors for nitrate (NO3 (-)) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM) to measure surface water concentrations at 30 min intervals over the snowmelt period (March 21-May 13, 2009) at a 40.5 hectare forested watershed at Sleepers River, Vermont. We also collected discrete samples for laboratory absorbance and fluorescence as well as delta O-18-NO3 (-) isotopes to help interpret the drivers of variable NO3 (-) and FDOM concentrations measured in situ. In situ data revealed seasonal, event and diurnal patterns associated with hydrological and biogeochemical processes regulating stream NO3 (-) and FDOM concentrations. An observed decrease in NO3 (-) concentrations after peak snowmelt runoff and muted response to spring rainfall was consistent with the flushing of a limited supply of NO3 (-) (mainly from nitrification) from source areas in surficial soils. Stream FDOM concentrations were coupled with flow throughout the study period, suggesting a strong hydrologic control on DOM concentrations in the stream. However, higher FDOM concentrations per unit streamflow after snowmelt likely reflected a greater hydraulic connectivity of the stream to leachable DOM sources in upland soils. We also observed diurnal NO3 (-) variability of 1-2 mu mol l(-1) after snowpack ablation, presumably due to in-stream uptake prior to leafout. A comparison of NO3 (-) and dissolved organic carbon yields (DOC, measured by FDOM proxy) calculated from weekly discrete samples and in situ data sub-sampled daily resulted in small to moderate differences over the entire study period (-4 to 1% for NO3 (-) and -3 to -14% for DOC), but resulted in much larger differences for daily yields (-66 to +27% for NO3 (-) and -88 to +47% for DOC, respectively). Despite challenges inherent in in situ sensor deployments in harsh seasonal conditions, these data provide important insights into processes controlling NO3 (-) and FDOM in streams, and will be critical for evaluating the effects of climate change on snowmelt delivery to downstream ecosystems.

New Insights into the Source of Decadal Increases of Dissolved Organic Matter in Acid-Sensitive Lakes of the Northeastern United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The last several decades have seen decreases in SO42- deposition across the northeastern United States. As a result, SO42- concentrations in lakes and streams have also decreased and many surface water bodies have become less acidic. During the same time period, there has been a concurrent increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOG) concentrations in many lakes and streams. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality of archived samples from nine acid-sensitive lakes in Maine collected between 1993 and 2009, and determined that increased DOM contributions to lakes were primarily derived from litter and soil. All five lakes with increasing DOC trends demonstrated significant decreasing (i.e., more terrestrial) trends in fluorescence index (FI) and significant positive correlations between SO42- and FT. This study used the chemical signature of terrestrial DOM to support the hypothesis that increased DOC concentrations in lakes and streams are driven by declining acid deposition and increased solubility of soil organic matter across a large area of the landscape.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can potentially alter the fate of these contaminants in aqueous systems by forming contaminant-DOM complexes. In-situ measurements were made to assess the interactions between three common PPCP contaminants and two distinct DOM sources: a wastewater treatment plant (WWOM) and the Suwannee River, GA (SROM). Aqueous DOM solutions (8.0 mg L-1 C, pH 7.4) were spiked with a range of concentrations of bisphenol-A, carbamazepine and ibuprofen to assess the DOM fluorophores quenched by PPCP interaction in excitation-emission matrices (EEM). Interaction effects on target analyte (PPCP) concentrations were also quantified using direct aqueous injection ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). At low bisphenol-A concentration, WVVOM fluorescence was quenched in an EEM region attributed to microbial by product-like and humic acid-like DOM components, whereas carbamazepine and ibuprofen quenched fulvic acid-like fluorophores. Fluorescence quenching of SROM by bisphenol-A and carbamazepine was centered on humic acid-like components, whereas ibuprofen quenched the fulvic acid-like fluorophores. Nearly complete LC-MS/MS recovery of all three contaminants was obtained, irrespective of analyte structure and DOM source, indicating relatively weak PPCP-DOM bonding interactions. The results suggest that presence of DOM at environmentally-relevant concentration can give rise to PPCP interactions that could potentially affect their environmental transport, but these DOM-contaminant interactions do not suppress the accurate assessment of target analyte concentrations by aqueous injection LC-MS/MSMS.

Dissolved Organic Matter Enhances Microbial Mercury Methylation Under Sulfidic Conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is generally thought to lower metal bioavailability in aquatic systems due to the formation of metal DOM complexes that reduce free metal ion concentrations. However, this model may not be pertinent for metal nanoparticles, which are now understood to be ubiquitous, sometimes dominant, metal species in the environment. The influence of DOM on Hg bioavailability to microorganisms was examined under conditions (0.5-5.0 nM Hg and 2-10 mu M sulfide) that favor the formation of beta-HgS(s) (metacinnabar) nanoparticles. We used the methylation of stable-isotope enriched (HgCl2)-Hg-201 by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 in short-term washed cell assays as a sensitive, environmentally significant proxy for Hg uptake. Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and Williams Lake hydrophobic acid (WLHPoA) substantially enhanced (2- to 38-fold) the bioavailability of Hg to ND132 over a wide range of Hg/DOM ratios (9.4 pmol/mg DOM to 9.4 nmol/mg DOM), including environmentally relevant ratios. Methylmercury (MeHg) production by ND132 increased linearly with either SRHA or WLHPoA concentration, but SRHA, a terrestrially derived DOM, was far more effective at enhancing Hg-methylation than WLHPoA, an aquatic DOM dominated by autochthonous sources. No DOM-dependent enhancement in Hg methylation was observed in Hg-DOM-sulfide solutions amended with sufficient L-cysteine to prevent beta-HgS(s) formation. We hypothesize that small HgS particles, stabilized against aggregation by DOM, are bioavailable to Hg-methylating bacteria. Our laboratory experiments provide a mechanism for the positive correlations between DOC and MeHg production observed in many aquatic sediments and wetland soils.

Controls on the composition and lability of dissolved organic matter in Siberia's Kolyma River basin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												High-latitude northern rivers export globally significant quantities of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the Arctic Ocean. Climate change, and its associated impacts on hydrology and potential mobilization of ancient organic matter from permafrost, is likely to modify the flux, composition, and thus biogeochemical cycling and fate of exported DOC in the Arctic. This study examined DOC concentration and the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) across the hydrograph in Siberia's Kolyma River, with a particular focus on the spring freshet period when the majority of the annual DOC load is exported. The composition of DOM within the Kolyma basin was characterized using absorbance-derived measurements (absorbance coefficient a(330), specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), and spectral slope ratio S-R) and fluorescence spectroscopy (fluorescence index and excitation-emission matrices (EEMs)), including parallel factor analyses of EEMs. Increased surface runoff during the spring freshet led to DOM optical properties indicative of terrestrial soil inputs with high humic-like fluorescence, SUVA(254), and low S-R and fluorescence index (FI). Under-ice waters, in contrast, displayed opposing trends in optical properties representing less aromatic, lower molecular weight DOM. We demonstrate that substantial losses of DOC can occur via biological (similar to 30% over 28 days) and photochemical pathways (>29% over 14 days), particularly in samples collected during the spring freshet. The emerging view is therefore that of a more dynamic and labile carbon pool than previously thought, where DOM composition plays a fundamental role in controlling the fate and removal of DOC at a pan-Arctic scale.

A quantitative analysis of this interference, or matrix effect, on organic contaminant target analyte measurements was carried out using un-fractionated and fractionated dissolved natural organic matter from the Suwannee River, GA (SROM), a standard reference material, that was directly infused into the tandem mass spectrometer during multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of a suite of endocrine disrupting compounds-pharmaceuticals and personal care products (EDC/PPCPs). Most target analytes suffered signal suppression in the presence of both fractionated and un-fractionated SROM, however greater interferences were measured with fractionated relative to bulk SROM. This finding is consistent with the view of organic matter as a supramolecular association of low molecular mass components having separate charged and structural features revealed only after dissociation.

J	Oren, A; Chefetz, B				Oren, Adi; Chefetz, Benny			Sorptive and Desorptive Fractionation of Dissolved Organic Matter by Mineral Soil Matrices	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Interactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with soil minerals, such as metal oxides and clays, involve various sorption mechanisms and may lead to sorptive fractionation of certain organic moieties. While sorption of DOM to soil minerals typically involves a degree of irreversibility, it is unclear which structural components of DOM correspond to the irreversibly bound fraction and which factors may be considered determinants. To assist in elucidating that, the current study aimed at investigating fractionation of DOM during sorption and desorption processes in soil. Batch DOM sorption and desorption experiments were conducted with organic matter poor, alkaline soils. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy were used to analyze bulk DOM, sorbed DOM, and desorbed DOM fractions. Sorptive fractionation resulted mainly from the preferential uptake of aromatic, carboxylic, and phenolic moieties of DOM. Soil metal-oxide content positively affected DOM sorption and binding of some specific carboxylate and phenolate functional groups. Desorptive fractionation of DOM was expressed by the irreversible-binding nature of some carboxylic moieties, whereas other bound carboxylic moieties were readily desorbed. Inner-sphere, as opposed to outer-sphere, ligand-exchange complexation mechanisms may be responsible for these irreversible, as opposed to reversible, interactions, respectively. The interaction of aliphatic DOM constituents with soil, presumably through weak van der Waals forces, was minor and increased with increasing proportion of clay minerals in the soil. Revealing the nature of DOM-fractionation processes is of great importance to understanding carbon stabilization mechanisms in soils, as well as the overall fate of contaminants that might be associated with DOM.																	0047-2425					MAR	2012	41	2					526	533		10.2134/jeq2011.0362						WOS:000300851200025	22370415

Anthropogenic aerosols as a source of ancient dissolved organic matter in glaciers	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Glacier-derived dissolved organic matter represents a quantitatively significant source of ancient, yet highly bioavailable carbon to downstream ecosystems(1). This finding runs counter to logical perceptions of age-reactivity relationships, in which the least reactive material withstands degradation the longest and is therefore the oldest(2). The remnants of ancient peatlands and forests overrun by glaciers have been invoked as the source of this organic matter(1,3,4). Here, we examine the radiocarbon age and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in snow, glacier surface water, ice and glacier outflow samples from Alaska to determine the origin of the organic matter. Low levels of compounds derived from vascular plants indicate that the organic matter does not originate from forests or peatlands. Instead, we show that the organic matter on the surface of the glaciers is radiocarbon depleted, consistent with an anthropogenic aerosol source. Fluorescence spectrophotometry measurements reveal the presence of protein-like compounds of microbial or aerosol origin. In addition, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry measurements document the presence of combustion products found in anthropogenic aerosols. Based on the presence of these compounds, we suggest that aerosols derived from fossil fuel burning are a source of pre-aged organic matter to glacier surfaces. Furthermore, we show that the molecular signature of the organic matter is conserved in snow, glacier water and outflow, suggesting that the anthropogenic carbon is exported relatively unchanged in glacier outflows.

Evaluating the ameliorative effect of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality on copper toxicity to Daphnia magna: improving the BLM	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Various quality predictors of seven different natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) and humic substances were evaluated for their influence on protection of Daphnia magna neonates against copper (Cu) toxicity. Protection was examined at 3 and 6 mg l(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of each DOM isolate added to moderately hard, dechlorinated water. Other water chemistry parameters (pH, concentrations of DOC, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were kept relatively constant. Predictors included absorbance ratios Abs(254/365) (index of molecular weight) and Abs-octanol(254)/Abs-water(254) (index of lipophilicity), specific absorption coefficient (SAC(340); index of aromaticity), and fluorescence index (FI; index of source). In addition, the fluorescent components (humic-like, fulvic-like, tryptophan-like, and tyrosine-like) of the isolates were quantified by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Up to 4-fold source-dependent differences in protection were observed amongst the different DOMs. Significant correlations in toxicity amelioration were found with Abs(254/365), Abs-octanol(254)/Abs-water(254), SAC(340), and with the humic-like fluorescent component. The relationships with FI were not significant and there were no relationships with the tryptophan-like or tyrosine-like fluorescent components at 3 mg C l(-1), whereas a negative correlation was seen with the fulvic-like component. In general, the results indicate that larger, optically dark, more lipophilic, more aromatic DOMs of terrigenous origin, with higher humic-like content, are more protective against Cu toxicity. A method for incorporating SAC(340) as a DOM quality indicator into the Biotic Ligand Model is presented; this may increase the accuracy for predicting Cu toxicity in natural waters.				Smith, D.

Therefore, it is crucial to determine the effects of changing land use on the DOM composition in the river watershed. Water samples were collected from the outlets of 15 sub-watersheds in the subtropical Jiulong River (southeast China) for fluorescence measurements and parallel factor analysis. Two humic-like (C1 and C2) and one protein-like (C3) fluorescent components were identified. Overall, DOM in the Jiulong River watershed was dominated by humic-like materials, probably due to the fact that 69% of the watershed is covered with forest. The 15 sub-watersheds were grouped into four clusters based on the proportion of each fluorescent component in the total fluorescence, suggesting that the DOM composition could be very different among sub-watersheds. There was a strong negative correlation between C2 and C3%. C1% correlated with the water body fraction, likely associated with the aquatic production of C1. C3% correlated positively with the residential area fraction, likely indicating the influence of anthropogenic activities. These results are useful for assessing the effects of land use/land cover changes on the composition and hence biogeochemical roles of DOM in aquatic environments.

Behavior of Reoccurring PARAFAC Components in Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter in Natural and Engineered Systems: A Critical Review	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) has been widely used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM). Characterization is based on the intensity and location of independent fluorescent components identified in models constructed from excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). Similar fluorescent components have been identified in PARAFAC studies across a wide range of systems; however, there is a lack of discussion regarding the consistency with which these similar components behave. The overall goal of this critical review is to compare results for PARAFAC studies published since the year 2000 which include one or more of three reoccurring humic-like components. Components are compared and characterized based on EEM location, characteristic ecosystems, and behavior in natural and engineered systems. This synthesis allows PARAFAC users to more confidently infer DOM characteristics based on identified components. Additionally, behavioral inconsistencies between similar components help elucidate DOM properties for which fluorescence spectroscopy with PARAFAC may be a weak predictive tool.

In early July 2008, with a nearly peak river water discharge period, remarkably high humic F intensity and high [DFe] were found with a decrease in salinity (S = 26-30) in the surface water of the Yukon River estuarine region. These results suggest that riverine humic-type FDOM is responsible for [DFe] in coastal waters, with natural organic ligand complexation of Fe(III) apparently playing an important role in iron transport to the northern Bering Sea shelf. In the St. Lawrence Island and Chukchi shelf polynya regions, cold dense waters (T = -1.5 to -1.7 degrees C and sigma(theta) = 26.2 to 26.7) were found in deep and bottom waters. The cold waters are characterized by high nutrient and iron concentrations and high humic F intensity, probably resulting from two main processes: brine rejection during sea ice formation and transport across the sediment-water interface during early diagenesis. In the central Bering Strait, the waters are vertically uniform with high salinity (S >= 32.5) and high nutrient and iron concentrations. These waters appear to originate from the outer shelf of the Bering Sea and are not affected by denitrification occurring in bottom sediments of the Bering shelf.

Linkages between denitrification and dissolved organic matter quality, Boulder Creek watershed, Colorado	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) fuels the majority of in-stream microbial processes, including the removal of nitrate via denitrification. However, little is known about how the chemical composition of DOM influences denitrification rates. Water and sediment samples were collected across an ecosystem gradient, spanning the alpine to plains, in central Colorado to determine whether the chemical composition of DOM was related to denitrification rates. Laboratory bioassays measured denitrification potentials using the acetylene block technique and carbon mineralization via aerobic bioassays, while organic matter characteristics were evaluated using spectroscopic and fractionation methods. Denitrification potentials under ambient and elevated nitrate concentrations were strongly correlated with aerobic respiration rates and the percent mineralized carbon, suggesting that information about the aerobic metabolism of a system can provide valuable insight regarding the ability of the system to additionally reduce nitrate. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) revealed that under elevated nitrate concentrations denitrification potentials were positively related to the presence of protein-like fluorophores and negatively related to more aromatic and oxidized fractions of the DOM pool. Using MLR, the chemical composition of DOM, carbon, and nitrate concentrations explained 70% and 78% of the observed variability in denitrification potential under elevated and ambient nitrate conditions, respectively. Thus, it seems likely that DOM optical properties could help to improve predictions of nitrate removal in the environment. Finally, fluorescence measurements revealed that bacteria used both protein and humic-like organic molecules during denitrification providing further evidence that larger, more aromatic molecules are not necessarily recalcitrant in the environment.

Direct Hydrodynamic Radius Measurement on Dissolved Organic Matter in Natural Waters Using Diffusion NMR	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter from natural waters is a complex mixture of various chemical components, which play vital roles in many environmental processes such as the global carbon cycle and the fate of many key anthropogenic pollutants. Despite its environmental significance, dissolved organic matter in natural form has never been studied using nuclear magnetic resonance based hydrodynamic radius measurements due to its extremely low concentration (e.g., a few mg/L) in natural waters. In this study, NMR-based hydrodynamic radius measurements were performed directly on unconcentrated pond, river, and sea waters. The key chemical components of the dissolved organic matters from different sources were identified as carbohydrates, carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules, and aliphatic molecules. By using the Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland equation, the average hydrodynamic radii of the three key components were calculated.																	0013-936X					FEB 7	2012	46	3					1675	1680		10.1021/es202809e						WOS:000299864400050	22211466

New approaches are thus needed for a better understanding of DOM reactivity and fate in aquatic systems. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using size-exclusion separation, was coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). A solvent-elimination interface was used to deposit DOM fractions onto a germanium disk that were then analyzed by FTIR. Samples included ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) and fulvic acids from the St. Lawrence Estuary and its tributaries. Results showed significant compositional changes with molecular size and origin, especially in UDOM. Larger fractions of UDOM contained more carbohydrates, amides, aromatics/alkenes and aliphatics, while smaller fractions contained more carboxylate and OH groups. Small marine molecules (500-900 Da) were also enriched in sulfate groups that appeared bound to UDOM. Large marine molecules were the most amide-rich fractions. Fulvic acids were enriched in carboxylate and OH groups, showed little changes in composition, and appeared similar to small terrigenous (riverine) UDOM even in marine water. This work shows that an HPLC-FTIR system is a powerful and complementary tool in the characterization of DOM. The compositional changes observed may explain the reported contrasting reactivity and fate of DOM having different size and origin.																	0013-936X					FEB 7	2012	46	3					1700	1707		10.1021/es203711v						WOS:000299864400053	22216934

Biological waste treatment at both mills resulted in a final effluent COD of 240 mg L-1. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was only 1.2 times higher in the Kraft effluent (70 vs. 58 mg L-1), however, GAC treatment of Kraft and TMP/RCF effluent was largely different on the DOC persisted after biological treatment. The molecular mass (636 vs. 534 g mol(-1)) and aromaticity (5.35 vs. 4.67 L mg(-1) m(-1)) of humic substances (HS) were slightly higher in the Kraft effluent. The HS aromaticity was decreased by a factor of 1.0 L mg(-1) m(-1) in both Kraft and TMP/RCF effluent. The molecular mass of the Kraft effluent increased by 50 g mol(-1) while the molecular mass of the TMP/RCF effluent was essentially unchanged after GAC treatment; the DOC removal efficiency of the GAC on Kraft effluent was biased towards the low molecular weight humic compounds. The rapid adsorption of this fraction, coupled with the slightly higher aromaticity of the humic components resulted in early breakthrough on the Kraft effluent. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix analysis of the each GAC treated effluent indicated that the refractory components were higher molecular weight humics on the Kraft effluent and protein-like compounds on the TMP/RCF effluent. Although the GAC exhaustion rates are too high for an effective DOC removal option for biologically treated pulp and paper mill effluents, the study indicates that advanced organic characterisation techniques can be used to diagnose GAC performance on complex effluents with comparable bulk DOC and COD loads.

In addition, estrogenicity was estimated in association with the removal of E2 via its sorption onto DOM and biodegradation. The more biodegradable lake-derived DOM promoted more extensive transformation of E2 into E1 than the effluent organic matter through a biodegradation process. Overall, under all conditions, biodegradation dominated the removal of E2 in water. The increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in river and lake-derived DOM (e.g. 6.5 mg C L-1) reduced the removal of E2 by decreasing its biodegradation due to the moderate sorption of E2 onto DOM. The effluent organic matter showed greater removal of E2 via biodegradation, as well as significantly high sorption. This was associated with a large amount of hydrophobic fulvic acid (FA)- and humic acid (HA)-like organic components, as shown by the small increase in the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)). An increase in the DOC concentration reduced the removal of E2, resulting in high estrogenicity. The present study suggests that both organic composition and DOC concentration influenced the removal of E2 and, therefore, should be fully considered when assessing estrogenicity and its impacts on the aquatic environment.

Cu(II) binding to DOM was also increased by OFL, while Mg(II) binding was decreased by OFL The change in OFL binding amount in the absence and presence of cations (Delta C-b) was calculated and compared with cation binding (C-b(m)). Delta C-b/C-b(m) was in the range of 1-3 for Cu(II) depending on the applied Cu concentration. Two ternary complexes of DOM-OFL-Cu and DOM-Cu-OFL were proposed. For Mg(II), Delta C-b/C-b(m) was around -1 at Mg(II) concentrations lower than 1 mM, but decreased up to 5 with increasing Mg(II) concentration. The competitive effect of Mg(II) to OFL was thus proposed. FTIR spectra were collected for mechanistic discussion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

OFL fluorescence intensity was corrected for inner filter and temperature effects. The kinetics data were fitted well using a two-compartment pseudo first-order kinetics model. Three quenching compartments were identified using this model, namely, a very fast quenching compartment (q(0)) and two pseudo first-order quenching compartments (q(1) + q(2)). The q(0) values had a positive relationship with temperature, while (q(1) + q(2)) were negatively related with temperature. In addition, OFL-DOM binding quantified by (q(1) + q(2)) was consistent with binding result obtained from dialysis equilibrium system. We concluded that go was resulted from dynamic quenching, while (q(1) + q(2)) was attributed to static quenching. The dynamic quenching of OFL by DOM accounted for 30-90% to the overall quenching and thus was very significant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We conducted a laboratory incubation experiment to assess soil respiration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in response to salinity and sodicity in two soils of different texture. Two non-saline non-sodic soils (a sand and a sandy clay loam) were leached 3-4 times with solutions containing different concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2 to reach almost identical electrical conductivity (EC1:5) in both soils (EC1:5 0.5, 1.3, 2.5 and 4.0 dS m(-1) in the sand and EC1:5 0.7, 1.4, 2.5 and 4.0 dS m-1 in the sandy clay loam) combined with two sodium absorption ratios: SAR < 3 and 20. Finely ground wheat straw residue was added (20 g kg(-1)) as substrate to stimulate microbial activity. Cumulative respiration was more strongly affected by EC than by SAR. It decreased by 8% at EC 1.3 and by 60% at EC 4.0 in the sand, whereas EC had no effect on respiration in the sandy clay loam. The apparent differential sensitivity to EC in the two soils can be explained by their different water content and therefore, different osmotic potential at the same EC. At almost similar osmotic potential: -2.92 MPa in sand (at EC 1.3) and -2.76 MPa in the sandy clay loam (at EC 4.0) the relative decrease in respiration was similar (8-9%). Sodicity had little effect on cumulative respiration in the soils, but DOC, DON and specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA) were significantly higher at SAR 20 than at SAR < 3 in combination with low EC in both soils (EC 0.5 in the sand and EC 0.7 and 1.4 in the sandy clay loam). Therefore, high SAR in combination with low EC is likely to increase the risk of DOC and DON leaching in the salt-affected soils, which may lead to further soil degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

USE EXTRACAPSULAR DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER? AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A C-13-ENRICHED AMINO ACID	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												Many marine gastropod species brood their embryos in thin-walled capsules to protect them during development. Despite its beneficial effects, encapsulation has two major constraints, nutrition and oxygen supply, which affect embryo development and larval survival. Developing embryos usually rely on intracapsular food sources provided by the mother, in the form of yolk, nurse eggs and intracapsular fluid. However, it is still not clear if they are able to feed on extracapsular sources that may cross the capsule wall. We investigated this possibility in the calyptraeid species Crepidula fornicata. In this species, the internal capsule wall thickness sharply decreases during embryonic development, which might change wall permeability to small organic molecules, thus providing embryos with external dissolved organic matter. To test this hypothesis, encapsulated and excapsulated embryos of C. fornicata were placed for 48 h in a C-13-enriched amino acid (L-alanine) solution. Excapsulated embryos were enriched in C-13 (+5.75%), which suggested that they were able to assimilate the labelled amino acid. In contrast, encapsulated embryos were weakly enriched (+0.75%), suggesting that encapsulation greatly reduces the potential for the use of extracapsular amino acids and that encapsulated embryos mainly rely on maternal food.																	0260-1230					FEB	2012	78		1				100	104		10.1093/mollus/eyr044						WOS:000299346800011

Characterization of dissolved organic matter in Lake Superior and its watershed using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												With the advent of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (MS), recent studies have begun to resolve molecular relationships between terrestrial and aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in rivers, estuaries, mangrove swamps and their receiving oceans and lakes. Here, we extend ultrahigh resolution MS techniques to Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world by area. Solid-phase extracted samples from the western arm of the lake and its watershed, including swamp, creek, river, lake-river confluence and offshore lake sites were compared using electrospray ionization (ESI), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR-MS). Results were analyzed using cluster analysis and van Krevelen diagrams. Chemical similarity appears related to hydrological proximity, terrestrial impact and flow conditions. For example, higher and lower flow samples from the same stream differ from one another. Toivola Swamp, Lake Superior and the south shore river have diverse arrays of unique molecular formulae relative to the north shore river and stream sampled in the data set. The lake's unique elemental formulae, relative to its watershed samples, are primarily in the lignin-like and reduced hydrocarbon regions of van Krevelen diagrams. The ESI-amenable lake DOM also has a higher proportion of formulae containing nitrogen or sulfur relative to the other samples. The degree of overlap among formulae within the data set is consistent with previous ESI FT-ICR-MS characterization of terrestrial, estuarine and marine OM. There appears to be a conserved portion of formulae across natural OM samples, perhaps because these compounds are intrinsically refractory or because they are commonly generated as products of natural reworking processes.

The objective of this study was to investigate the estrogenic effects of DOM and its impact on the activity of the natural estrogen 17 beta-estradiol (E2). DOM of three different sources, HA sodium salt, Suwannee River natural organic matter (NOM), and Nordic Reservoir NOM, were used. The estrogenic activity was detected by using the yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. Estrogenic effects of DOM without and after solar irradiation were tested. Influences on the action of E2 by DOM were also investigated. No direct estrogenic effects of the DOM used were observed in the YES assay. However, the estrogenic activities after 24 h of irradiation increased to 0.0288, 0.0178, and 0.0195 mu M of E2 equivalents for HA sodium salt, Suwannee River NOM, and Nordic Reservoir NOM, respectively. After incubation of DOM, the estrogenic activity of E2 was increased by low concentrations (8.33 and 83.3 mu M) of DOM while decreased by higher concentrations (8.33 x 10(2) and 8.33 x 10(3) mu M) of DOM. Though direct estrogenic effects of DOM were not observed, increase in the estrogenic activity of DOM after irradiation was significant. DOM shows amphoteric influence on the natural estrogen E2, which depends on the concentration of DOM used. Because of its ubiquity, DOM may be of great ecological significance, playing an important role in regulating the reproduction of aquatic organisms.

Addition of 5 mg/L of Humic acid sodium (HA), Suwannee River NOM (SRNOM) and Nordic Reservoir NOM (NRNOM) all accelerated the photodegradation of 2,4',5-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB 31) significantly, with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.0933, 0.0651 and 0.0486 in the initial 12 h, respectively. HA and SRNOM, the allochthonous DOM, showed higher reactivity in the photolysis of PCB 31. The maximum photodegradation rate was observed in 5 mg/L of DOM solution. The roles of the reactive substances were studied by the inhibitory experiments, which suggested that (OH)-O-center dot and intra-DOM O-1(2) were more important for the photolysis of PCB 31 than other reactive substances, accounting for 35.1% and 47.1% of the degradation, respectively. The main degradation products of PCB 31 detected by GC-MS were 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid, hydroxy-2,5-dichloroben:zoic acid, 4-hydroxy-2',5'-dichlorobiphenyls and hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyls. The degradation pathways were accordingly proposed. Photosensitized degradation by DOM, especially the intra-DOM reactions, may be a very important mechanism for the transformation of PCBs and other hydrophobic organic contaminants in the environment.

Using a range of standard compounds as well as soil solutions sampled in the field, we compared the results of the HPLC/IRMS analysis with those from other methods for determining carbon and C-13 content. The conversion efficiency of the in-line wet oxidation of the HPLC/IRMS averaged 99.3 % for a range of standard compounds. The agreement between HPLC/IRMS and other methods in the amount and isotopic signature of both standard compounds and soil water samples was excellent. For DOM concentrations below 10 mg C L-1 (250 ng C total) pre-concentration or large volume injections are recommended in order to prevent background interferences. We were able to detect large differences in the C-13 signatures of soil solution DOM sampled in 10 cm depth of plots with either C3 or C4 vegetation and in two different parent materials. These measurements also demonstrated changes in the C-13 signature that demonstrate rapid loss of plant-derived C with depth. Overall the modified HLPC/IRMS system has the advantages of rapid sample preparation, small required sample volume and high sample throughput, while showing comparable performance with other methods for measuring the amount and isotopic signature of DOM.

Water samples were collected from two shallow submarine hydrothermal vents off NE Taiwan, the white vent and the yellow vent, during two cruises in August, 2010. Absorption and excitation-emission-matrix fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the optical properties of DOM from such extremely special environments. The absorption coefficients at wavelength 300 nm (a(300)) were much higher at the white vent mouth and 1 m below it (2.52 +/- 0.88 m(-1)) than in the background (0.34 +/- 0.12 m(-1)). This indicated that the white vent was a source of CDOM for seawater. Three fluorescent components were identified using parallel factor analysis: humic-like C1, tyrosine-like C3, and C2 as a combination of tryptophan-like and marine humic-like components. Both C1 and C3 (but not C2) had their highest fluorescence intensity at the white vent mouth and 1 m below it, suggesting the role of the vent as a source for both humic-like and tyrosine-like DOM. Samples from the yellow vent mouth also had a higher 0300 than the ambient seawater in our first cruise, but had fluorescence intensities of C(1-3) similar to the ambient seawater. Overall, the low humification index (HIX: 1.40 +/- 0.30) and the high autochthonous index (BIX: 1.27 +/- 0.63) indicated that the DOM likely had low humic contents and was mainly autochthonous of biological or bacterial origin in the study area. A biplot of HIX and BIX showed that DOM from the hydrothermal vents had a characteristic similar to terrestrial cave and spring waters, but was distinct from isolated humics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal phototransformation of dissolved organic matter to ammonium, dissolved inorganic carbon, and labile substrates supporting bacterial biomass across the Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We studied the photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), ammonium (NH(4)(+)), and labile organic substrates supporting bacterial carbon biomass along a salinity gradient throughout the Baltic Sea during summer, autumn, and spring. The photoproduced DIC, NH(4)(+), and labile DOM supporting bacterial biomass were related to the number of photons absorbed during the irradiations of biologically recalcitrant DOM to determine apparent quantum yields. The apparent quantum yields for the photoproduction of DIC and NH(4)(+) lacked seasonal variation, but behaved differently along the salinity gradient; the photoproduction of DIC decreased, while photoammonification increased with increasing salinity. The apparent quantum yield for the photoproduction of labile DOM supporting bacterial biomass was highest in summer and unaffected by salinity. The annual photoammonification rate over the entire Baltic Sea ranged from 0.038 to 0.049 Tg N, equivalent to 13%-23% of the annual atmospheric deposition of inorganic N. The annual phototransformation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), including the direct photomineralization and indirect bacterial mineralization of photoproduced labile DOM (total of 2.71-3.94 Tg C), exceeded the annual river loading of photoreactive DOC, assuming that half of the total river DOC input to the Baltic Sea is photoreactive. As the annual photomineralization of DOC exceeded the annual terrestrial input of photoreactive DOC to the Baltic Sea, the photochemical transformation is a major sink for terrestrial DOC in such coastal systems.																	0148-0227					JAN 19	2012	117								G01004	10.1029/2010JG001633						WOS:000299388700001

The role of dissolved organic matter in arctic surface waters in the photolysis of hexachlorobenzene and lindane	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) can impact the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are transported to the Arctic via global distillation. Interactions between DOM and POPs through hydrophobic binding processes may influence their photofate in arctic surface waters. We examined the DOM-mediated photodegradation of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in arctic surface waters. These two halogenated organic compounds are commonly detected in the Arctic. We examined how different sources of DOM affect the indirect photolysis of these compounds. We conducted our study using DOM from arctic streams and lakes near the Toolik Lake Long-term Ecological Research Site. HCB or lindane was irradiated in the presence and absence of DOM from these sources, both at the surface of an arctic lake and at 10 cm depth, to investigate the indirect phototransformation of these two compounds and the depth dependence of the observed chemistry. In both artificial and natural sunlight, two of four DOM sources studied stimulated the photodegradation of HCB but not of lindane, suggesting that the indirect phototransformation is a selective process depending on the interactions between DOM and POPs. Through solubility studies, we found that HCB readily partitions to isolated Toolik Lake DOM, while lindane shows no affinity for DOM, findings that corroborate results previously reported in the literature. We demonstrate for the first time DOM's role as a sensitizer for photodegradation of some POPs under field conditions, thus confirming that this process may be an important control on the fate of POPs exhibiting a strong affinity for DOM.

In the present study, the pool sizes of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM), potential mineralizable N (PMN) and bioavailable carbon (C) (measured as cumulative CO2 evolution over 63 days) were compared in soils under three coniferous species - 73 year old slash (Pinus elliottii), hoop (Araucaria cunninghamii) and kauri (Agathis robusta) pines. Results have shown that dissolved organic N (DON) in hot water extracts was 1.5-1.7 times lower in soils under slash pine than under hoop and kauri pines, while soil dissolved organic C (DOC) in hot water extracts tended to be higher under slash pine than hoop and kauri pines but this was not statistically significant. This has led to the higher DOC:DON ratio in soils under slash pine (32) than under hoop and kauri pines (17). Soil DOC and DON in 2 M KCl extracts were not significantly different among the three tree species. The DOC:DON ratio (hot water extracts) was positively and significantly correlated with soil C:N (R-2 = 0.886, P<0.01) and surface litter C:N ratios (R-2 = 0.768, P<0.01), indicating that DOM was mainly derived from litter materials and soil organic matter through dissolution and decomposition. Soil pH was lower under slash pine (4.5) than under hoop (6.0) and kauri (6.2) pines, and negatively correlated with soil total C. C:N ratio, DOC and DOC:DON ratio (hot water extracts), indicating the soil acidity under slash pine favored the accumulation of soil C. Moreover, the amounts of dissolved inorganic N, PMN and bio-available C were also significantly lower in soils under slash pine than under hoop and kauri pines. It is concluded that changes in the quantity and quality of surface litters and soil pH induced by different tree species largely determined the size and quality of soil DOM, and plantations of hoop and kauri pine trees may be better in maintaining long-term soil N fertility than slash pine plantations.

Stable isotope analysis of organic carbon in small (mu g C) samples and dissolved organic matter using a GasBench preparation device	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY												The stable isotopes of organic matter can provide valuable information on carbon cycling dynamics, microbial metabolisms, and past climates. Since bulk measurements may mask dynamic changes to critical portions of the organic pool, researchers are increasingly isolating individual compounds for isotopic analysis. The amount of carbon isolated is frequently small, requiring specialized equipment for its analysis. We present a simple and accurate method to measure the delta(13)C values of mu g-amounts of organic compounds and dissolved organic matter in freshwaters using wet oxidation and a GasBench II preparation device. Samples containing 3 mu g C can be analyzed with a precision of <0.4 parts per thousand. For samples containing 1.2 mu g C, the precision is <0.8 parts per thousand. The blank is estimated to be similar to 0.2 mu g C. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated for a wide range of compounds including those that are difficult to oxidize such as humic acid and phthalic acid. The delta(13)C values of DOC from river and riparian ground water determined by this method are comparable with those determined with an elemental analyzer on freeze-dried samples of DOC. The low detection limit and the ease with which it can be combined with isolation techniques such as liquid chromatography make this technique attractive for the off-line analysis of organic compounds, and open new possibilities for the development of methodologies for compound-specific carbon isotope analysis of complex mixtures separated by HPLC.

The efficiency of activated carbon (AC) adsorption as a method in drinking water treatment has been investigated in removing HS at different pH values (pH = 5; 6; 7; 8) in static equilibrium experiments. The degradation of HS was studied with an EM (effective microorganisms) bacteria community, and solutions of fulvic acid, sodium humate furthermore extracts of sandy soil were investigated. EM products are widely used but their effect on HS has not been investigated before. The combination of EM and AC methods in the case of fulvic acid resulted in higher performance than any of these methods alone. Humic substances were analyzed using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer and by total organic carbon (TOC) measurements.

According to these results the degradation was efficient, especially in fulvic acid solutions.																	1606-9749						2012	12	1					65	71		10.2166/ws.2011.119						WOS:000327748300008

In this paper, a 1 year water quality survey was conducted around the lake and statistical analysis tools were used to characterize the variations of organic pollutants. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) confirm the seasonal and spatial variations of surface water quality in Lake Taihu. Surface water quality is better during the wet season and worse downstream during the dry season. The dissolved organic matter was further analyzed using a parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model with three-dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence matrices. Four components were extracted from the fluorescence data, namely, two autochthonous biodegradation products (Cl: amino acids, C4: protein-like materials) and two humic-like substances (C2: from microbial processing, C3: terrestrial). Cl and C4 were dominant in the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorophores; this result is similar to those of other inland water bodies in China. The CDOM fluorophores showed similar seasonal and spatial variations with common water quality indices, with the exception of the seasonal responses of C2 in winter. Bivariance correlations between the organic and nutrient concentrations and the fluorescence intensities of the CDOM fluorophores imply possible common sources of the different contaminants. This paper exemplifies advanced statistical methods as a useful tool in understanding the behavior of contaminants in inland fresh water systems.																	1606-9749						2012	12	4					439	450		10.2166/ws.2012.007						WOS:000327748900004

Competitive removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and inorganic anions by anion exchange resins (AERs)	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Four strong-base anion exchange resins (AERs) with different properties were selected to investigate dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal from river water containing inorganic anions. Rapid sand-filtered water was obtained from a water treatment plant in Tokyo, Japan, and then concentrated by an ultrafiltration membrane for use in ion exchange experiments to simulate high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulfate conditions. AERs removed 23-50% of DOC and 70-80% of UV254 within 30 min despite high sulfate concentration (121 mg/L). Although the materials and structure of the AERs did not affect the reduction of UV254, DOC removal was affected. The highest DOC reduction was achieved by a macroporous polyacrylic AER (Purolite), while the macroporous polystyrene IRA 910 had the lowest DOC removal. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model showed that the rate constants and the initial sorption rates of polyacrylic resins were higher than those by polystyrene resins, suggesting that more hydrophilic structure of AERs exhibited faster DOC removal. Aromatic DOM with a molecular weight (MW) of 800-3,000 Da was almost completely removed by AERs, whereas only half of aromatic DOMs smaller than 800 Da were removed by AERs. Adsorbed DOC comprised less than 6% of all exchanged anions, whereas the adsorbed sulfate was about 90% due to comparatively high concentration of sulfate in the water sample.																	1606-9749						2012	12	5					630	636		10.2166/ws.2012.037						WOS:000327749000011

Moving towards a technical specification for fluorescence excitation-emission mapping and absorbance analysis of colored dissolved organic matter	DESIGN AND NATURE VI: COMPARING DESIGN IN NATURE WITH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				6th International Conference on Comparing Design in Nature with Science and Engineering	JUN 11-13, 2012	La Coruna, SPAIN	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ A Coruna, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm, Int Journal Design & Nat & Ecodynam				Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) measurements with fluorescence and absorbance are important for a variety of natural water sources. Uncertainties have been propagated regarding CDOM spectral data from different instruments, sampling conditions and analysis algorithms. Recent efforts have thus focused on standardizing sample preparation, spectroscopic evaluation, and mathematical analysis to minimize interlaboratory variation The practical significance of simultaneous acquisition of the corrected absorbance spectrum and fluorescence excitation-emission map is discussed as a means to provide the least ambiguity. Variation can be caused by different light-exposure history (especially UV) in separate instruments, dissolved-oxygen content from temperature changes, and oxidation kinetics. Concentration changes in CDOM can be associated with optical anomalies, including self-quenching and -absorption, which systematically alter the fluorescence spectrum. Monitoring the absorbance and fluorescence simultaneously avoids these sampling variations and facilitates spectral correction. The proposed method(s) described are discussed regarding their potential as the basis for an international technical specification of the instrument and sampling conditions for CDOM analysis and reporting.																	1743-3541		978-1-84564-592-2				2012	160						295	306		10.2495/DN120261						WOS:000325721700026

The significant correlation between DOC and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) leads to an increasing need of CDOM monitoring for understanding the DOC land-water dynamics. This study is to report the results of using hyperspectral in-situ data and satellite images to estimate riverine CDOM from rivers to oceans and Great Lakes. A major research goal is to demonstrate that advancement of hyperspectral and high spatial resolution remote sensing technology is vital to the study of interactive processes between terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic environments.

J	Miller, CL; Liang, LY; Gu, BH				Miller, Carrie L.; Liang, Liyuan; Gu, Baohua			Competitive ligand exchange reveals time dependant changes in the reactivity of Hg-dissolved organic matter complexes	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Mercury interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) are important in aquatic environments but the kinetics of Hg binding to and repartitioning within the DOM remain poorly understood. We examined changes in Hg-DOM complexes using glutathione (GSH) titrations, coupled with stannous-reducible Hg measurements during Hg equilibration with DOM. In laboratory prepared DOM solutions and in water from a Hg-contaminated creek, a fraction of the Hg present as Hg-DOM complexes did not react to GSH addition. This unreactive Hg fraction increased with time from 13% at 1 h to 74% after 48 h of equilibration with a Suwannee River DOM. In East Fork Poplar Creek water in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, similar to 58% of the DOM-complexed Hg was unreactive with GSH 1 h after the sample was collected. This time-dependent increase in unreactive Hg suggests that Hg forms stronger complexes with DOM over time. Alternatively the DOM-complexed Hg may become more sterically protected from the ligand exchange reactions, as the binding environment changes within the DOM over time. These results have important implications to understanding Hg transformations in the natural environment, particularly in contaminated aquatic systems due to non-equilibrium interactions between Hg and DOM.

Tracing inputs of terrestrial high molecular weight dissolved organic matter within the Baltic Sea ecosystem	BIOGEOSCIENCES												To test the hypothesis whether high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM) in a high latitude marginal sea is dominated by terrestrial derived matter, 10 stations were sampled along the salinity gradient of the central and northern Baltic Sea and were analyzed for concentrations of dissolved organic carbon as well as delta C-13 values of HMW-DOM. Different end-member-mixing models were applied to quantify the influence of terrestrial DOM and to test for conservative versus non-conservative behavior of the terrestrial DOM in the different Baltic Sea basins. The share of terrestrial DOM to the total HMW-DOM was calculated for each station, ranging from 43 to 83 %. This shows the high influence of terrestrial DOM inputs for the Baltic Sea ecosystem. The data also suggest that terrestrial DOM reaching the open Baltic Sea is not subject to substantial removal any more. However compared to riverine DOM concentrations, our results indicate that substantial amounts of HMW-DOM (> 50 %) seem to be removed near the coastline during estuarine mixing. A budget approach yielded residence times for terrestrial DOM of 2.8, 3.0, and 4.5 yr for the Bothnian Bay, the Bothnian Sea and the Baltic Proper.

Dissolved organic matter composition and bioavailability reflect ecosystem productivity in the Western Arctic Ocean	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved amino acids (TDAA) were measured in high (Chukchi Sea) and low (Beaufort Sea) productivity regions of the western Arctic Ocean to investigate the composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Concentrations and DOC-normalized yields of TDAA in Chukchi surface waters were relatively high, indicating an accumulation of bioavailable DOM. High concentrations and yields of TDAA were also observed in the upper halocline of slope and basin waters, indicating off-shelf transport of bioavailable DOM from the Chukchi Sea. In contrast, concentrations and yields of TDAA in Beaufort surface waters were relatively low, indicting DOM was of limited bioavailability. Concentrations and yields of TDAA in the upper halocline of slope and basin waters were also low, suggesting the Beaufort is not a major source of bioavailable DOM to slope and basin waters. In shelf waters of both systems, elevated concentrations and yields of TDAA were often observed in waters with higher chlorophyll concentrations and productivity. Surface concentrations of DOC were similar (p > 0.05) in the two systems despite the contrasting productivity, but concentrations and yields of TDAA were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in the Chukchi than in the Beaufort. Unlike bulk DOC, TDAA concentrations and yields reflect ecosystem productivity in the western Arctic. The occurrence of elevated bioavailable DOM concentrations in the Chukchi Sea implies an uncoupling between the biological production and utilization of DOM and has important implications for sustaining heterotrophic microbial growth and diversity in oligotrophic waters of the central Arctic basins.

The formation of Trihalomethanes (THMs) and Haloacetic acids (HAAs) in chlorination of different DOM fractions was evaluated. The dominate species of THMs and HAAs were chloroform (CF) and trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) in the chlorination of raw water. There were close linear relationship between THMs/HAAs yields and SUVA(254) values. Increasing of contact time and chlorine dosage enhanced the formation of THMs/HAAs yields from different DOM fractions. The increase of pH leads to more formation of THMs, and the highest production of HAAs was observed at pH 7.																	1660-9336		978-3-03785-380-1				2012	157-158						1680	1684		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.157-158.1680						WOS:000310935600331		
J	Zhang, Y; Bi, EP				Zhang, Ying; Bi, Erping			Effect of dissolved organic matter on ammonium sorption kinetics and equilibrium to Chinese clinoptilolite	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												In the in-situ remediation of ammonium (NH4+) in groundwater by a sequential reactive barrier filled with zeolite, it is of great importance to understand the mechanisms of NH4+ sorption to zeolite. In this study, the effect of dissolved natural organic matter on NH4+ sorption to natural Chinese clinoptilolite was studied by batch experiments taking humic acid (HA) as a model substance. The surface of clinoptilolite was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). A needle cluster of sorbed HA could be observed on the surface of the clinoptilolite. The negative effect of HA on NH4+ sorption is thought to be their competition for sorption sites, the surface coverage and blockage of the pores of clinoptilolite by HA. The fitting results of kinetic sorption data indicated that the rate-controlling step for NH4+ sorption by clinoptilolite in both NH4+ and NH4+ + HA systems is the heterogeneous chemisorption. The existence of HA (10 mg/L) significantly reduced the initial sorption rate of NH4+, but the effect of a further concentration increase of HA was slight. The effect of HA on maximum sorption capacity was found to be insignificant in the experiments. A high aqueous Ca2+ concentration can decrease the negative effect of HA on NH4+ sorption by precipitation of calcium humate.																	0959-3330						2012	33	21					2395	2403		10.1080/09593330.2012.670268						WOS:000311120000004	23393982

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to influence aquatic nutrient dynamics, microbial community structure, and depth of light penetration in estuarine systems. Shark Bay is a sub-tropical ecosystem with limited freshwater inputs and restricted tidal flushing. As such, much of the DOM is expected to be seagrass-derived. However, combining excitation/emission fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARFAC) with C-13 stable isotope analysis of DOM, we found evidence for DOM inputs from terrestrial (riverine and possibly groundwater), autochthonous plankton, macroalgae, and seagrass sources. Isotopic analysis of C-13 in DOM supports the idea that seagrass inputs contribute substantially to the DOM pool in Shark Bay, whereas, EEM-PARAFAC data suggests that much of this input is derived from decomposing seagrass detritus and to a lesser extent due to exudation during primary production. We also report increases in DOM concentrations and changes in DOM characteristics with increasing salinity in surface water samples, indicating that evaporation is an important control on DOM concentration and photo-degradation may play a critical role in transforming DOM within the system.

Recent advances in structure and reactivity of dissolved organic matter: radiation chemistry of non-isolated natural organic matter and selected model compounds	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The importance of natural organic matter (NOM) as a source of carbon in natural waters, as the source of reactive oxygen species, or for the complications its presence causes in treatment of natural waters, is undeniable. Recent studies have also pointed to the major photochemical role of triplet excited state of natural organic matter in the environmental fate of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in waters. However, the characterization of NOM is problematic due to its complex molecular structure. One approach to better understand NOM chemistry is the use of model compounds. As the condensation of a plant's phenolic compounds leads to humification and the formation of NOM, a structurally broad group of nine phenolic compounds were selected as model compounds for this study. With methods used in the discipline of radiation chemistry, the oxidative chemistry and transient spectra of these phenols were studied. In addition, the oxidative chemistry and transient spectra of a sample of NOM from the Black River, North Carolina, USA, was characterized. This natural water sample was used as received and represents the first studies of non-isolated NOM by pulsed radiolysis. The results of the transient spectra of the NOM revealed that the radical intermediates were very long lived. This phenomenon was not captured using the nine model compounds suggesting that more complex compounds are needed to further our understanding of the oxidation chemistry of NOM.

Fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter in coastal Mediterranean waters influenced by a municipal sewage effluent (Bay of Marseilles, France)	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in coastal marine waters influenced by the municipal sewage effluent (SE) from Marseilles City (France, north-western Mediterranean Sea) has been characterised. Samples were collected eleven times from September 2008 to June 2010 in the Bay of Marseilles along a coast-open sea transect from the SE outlet in the South Bay and at the Mediterranean Institute Observation site in the central Bay. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) allowed the identification of two protein-like (tyrosine C1, with excitation maxima (lambda(Ex)) and an emission maximum (lambda(Em)) of <230, 275/306 nm; tryptophan C2, lambda(Ex)/lambda(Em), <230, 270/346 nm) and three humic-like components (marine humic C3, lambda(Ex)/lambda(Em) 280/386 nm; C4, lambda(Ex)/lambda(Em) 235, 340/410 nm; C5, lambda(Ex)/lambda(Em) 255, 365/474 nm). From the SE outlet to the central Bay, a gradient appeared, with decreasing FDOM intensities, decreasing dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon, nutrients and faecal bacteria concentrations and increasing salinity values. This gradient was associated with decreasing abundances in protein-like fluorophores and rising abundances in humic-like (C3 and C5) materials. This shift in FDOM composition illustrated the decrease in wastewater inputs and the increase in marine sources of DOM along the transect. FDOM data showed that the Marseilles SE spread up to 1500 m off the outlet, but it did not reach the central Bay. Tryptophan-like material was the dominant fluorophore in the SE and displayed the highest correlations with biogeochemical parameters (organic carbon, phosphates, faecal bacteria). Therefore, it is proposed to use its fluorescence intensity to detect and track SE inputs in the Marseilles coastal marine waters.

For naphthalene (NPH), phenanthrene (PHE), pyrene (PYR), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), 4-nonylphenol (NP), and short chain nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs), analytes 1-day uptake by SPMD decreased with increase of DOC from 0 to 10 (mg-C/L). However, at higher DOM level, analytes uptake by SPMD was found to be re-increased. At high pH, the uptake of OP and NP decreased significantly, due to the reduction of the effective species (molecular state) for SPMD. For PAHs and NPEOs, the effects of pH on their uptake were unremarkable. Effects of alkalinity and hardness on the analytes uptake by SPMD were not obvious.																	1018-4619						2012	21	9					2544	2550								WOS:000310112000003

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the evolution of DOM from pig and cattle manures during composting through excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and the binding ability of DOM toward copper (Cu) ions with the aid of fluorescence quenching titration. The excitation-emission matrix spectra indicated that tyrosine-like, tryptophan-like, and soluble microbial byproduct-like fluorescence decreased significantly, while humic-like and fulvic-like fluorescence increased and became the main peaks in composted manure DOM. Fluorescence quenching titration showed that the complexing capacities of pig and cattle manure DOM decreased after composting. Correlation analysis confirmed that complexing capacity of DOM positively and significantly correlates with tyrosine-like and soluble microbial byproduct-like materials which mostly degraded after composting. These results would suggest that the ability of manure DOM to complex with Cu is inhibited as a result of reduced protein-like materials after composting.

Dissolved organic matter in sea spray: a transfer study from marine surface water to aerosols	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Atmospheric aerosols impose direct and indirect effects on the climate system, for example, by absorption of radiation in relation to cloud droplets size, on chemical and organic composition and cloud dynamics. The first step in the formation of Organic primary aerosols, i.e. the transfer of dissolved organic matter from the marine surface into the atmosphere, was studied. We present a molecular level description of this phenomenon using the high resolution analytical tools of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Our experiments confirm the chemoselective transfer of natural organic molecules, especially of aliphatic compounds from the surface water into the atmosphere via bubble bursting processes. Transfer from marine surface water to the atmosphere involves a chemical gradient governed by the physicochemical properties of the involved molecules when comparing elemental compositions and differentiating CHO, CHNO, CHOS and CHNOS bearing compounds. Typical chemical fingerprints of compounds enriched in the aerosol phase were CHO and CHOS molecular series, smaller molecules of higher aliphaticity and lower oxygen content, and typical surfactants. A non-targeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that many of these molecules corresponded to homologous series of oxo-, hydroxy-, methoxy-, branched fatty acids and mono-, di- and tricarboxylic acids as well as monoterpenes and sugars. These surface active biomolecules were preferentially transferred from surface water into the atmosphere via bubble bursting processes to form a significant fraction of primary organic aerosols. This way of sea spray production leaves a selective biological signature of the surface water in the corresponding aerosol that may be transported into higher altitudes up to the lower atmosphere, thus contributing to the formation of secondary organic aerosol on a global scale or transported laterally with possible deposition in the context of global biogeocycling.

In this work, phenanthrene and DOM obtained from leachates with different landfill ages are selected as the target subjects. Fluorescence quenching technology is used to calculate the binding constant, K-doc. The quenching of DOM by phenanthrene during fluorescence spectroscopy is performed to further elucidate the interaction mechanism. The results show that K-doc increases with increasing landfill age. As well, the DOM composition becomes more complex as the landfill age increases. The synchronous fluorescence spectra of DOM are divided into three groups based on the positions of the peaks and their characteristics, after which their binding constants are calculated. The results of the present work imply that synchronous fluorescence spectra technology may be an effective tool for analyzing the interaction mechanism between DOM and PAHs.																	1018-4619						2012	21	8A					2266	2273								WOS:000309326100016

The elemental and spectroscopic analysis results showed that the composting process was characterized by the biodegradation of aliphatics, polysaccharide and proteins, as well as by the synthesis of aromatic structures, humic-like substances and macromolecules. Principal component analysis and correlation analysis indicated that the data from elemental and spectroscopic analysis fell into three main groups, and corresponded to the biodegradation, aromatization, and humification and polymerization state of the composting materials. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated rapid biodegradation of organic matter during the first eight days, and the formation of aromatic structures, humic-like materials and macromolecules in dissolved organic matter after eight days.																	0959-3330						2012	33	17					2033	2039		10.1080/09593330.2012.655427						WOS:000309043900011	23240197	
J	Pelfrene, A; Gassama, N				Pelfrene, Aurelie; Gassama, Nathalie			Competition between particles and dissolved organic matter for trace metal binding in unpolluted soil solutions: Monitoring and thermodynamic approaches	BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE												In this study, monitoring and thermodynamic approaches were combined in order to identify the dominant features, which control the speciation of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in solutions from unpolluted planosolic soil (North Massif Central, France). Three sites were selected according to topography and monitored from January to May 2006 using piezometers. The sandy-loam to clay-loam organic-rich horizon (horizon A) and the gravely and concretion-rich horizon (horizon E) were chosen to assess the potential impact of type of horizon on the chemical speciation of metals in the soil solutions. Binding of metals to organic ligands was studied by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) in order to acquire experimental data which could be used for the validation of speciation models. These data, together with data from the literature on properties of natural particulate matter, were used to determine the speciation of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn with a thermodynamic code (PHREEQC). The observed and predicted speciation were compared to estimate the contributions of natural dissolved organic matter and of particles to the binding of metal ions. There was a good match between observed and predicted results, validating the approach used. Results show that particles (mixed iron and aluminium oxides +/- clays +/- organic matter) play the main role in the speciation of the trace metals in soil waters rather than complexation with dissolved organic matter. Moreover, particles govern speciation to a greater extent in horizon E than in horizon A, which can be linked to hydrodynamics (reaction time between water and soil due to porosity) and chemical reactivity of the solution circulating.																	0037-9409	1777-5817					2012	183	3					189	201								WOS:000307918400003

We carried out a mesocosm experiment to assess how bacterioplankton communities responded to elevated levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and experimentally controlled stratification depth. The month-long experiment consisted of 2500 l mesocosms subjected to 4 experimental manipulations in triplicate: the stratification depth was set to either 1.5 or 3.5 m, with or without experimental addition of ambient levels of chromophoric DOM. DOM addition had a significant effect on bacterial community composition as assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of amplified 16S rRNA genes. In contrast, there were no effects of the DOM amendment on bacterial biomass or production. Mixing depth and the coupled effective light climate in the photic zone also had a significant effect on bacterial community composition. Furthermore, shallow mixing depth was associated with enhanced primary production, whereas DOM addition had a negative effect on phyto plankton biomass and productivity. Our results suggest that bacterial community composition is coupled to primary production under the studied coastal nutrient regime, and point to a key role of DOM quality in controlling bacterioplankton communities.

Trace metal speciation predictions in natural aquatic systems: incorporation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) spectroscopic quality	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												To calculate metal speciation in natural waters, modellers must choose the proportion of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is actively involved in metal complexation, defined here as the percentage of active fulvic acid (FA); to be able to estimate this proportion spectroscopically would be very useful. In the present study, we determine the free Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ concentrations in eight Canadian Shield lakes and compare these measured concentrations to those predicted by the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM VI). For seven of the eight lakes, the measured proportions of Cd2+ and Zn2+ fall within the range of values predicted by WHAM; the measured proportion of Cu2+ falls within this range for only half of the lakes sampled, whereas for Ni, WHAM systematically overestimated the proportion of Ni2+. With the aim of ascribing the differences between measured and modelled metal speciation to variations in DOM quality, the percentage of active FA needed to fit modelled and measured free metal concentrations was compared with the lake-to-lake variation in the spectroscopic quality of the DOM, as determined by absorbance and fluorescence measurements. Relationships between the percentage of active FA and DOM quality were apparent for Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn, suggesting the possibility of estimating the percentage of active FA spectroscopically and then using this information to refine model predictions. The relationships for Ni differed markedly from those observed for the other metals, suggesting that the DOM binding sites active in Cd, Cu and Zn complexation are different from those involved in Ni complexation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a distinction has been resolved in natural water samples.

J	Guo, WD; Yang, LY; Yu, XX; Zhai, WD; Hong, HS				Guo, Weidong; Yang, Liyang; Yu, Xiangxiang; Zhai, Weidong; Hong, Huasheng			Photo-production of dissolved inorganic carbon from dissolved organic matter in contrasting coastal waters in the southwestern Taiwan Strait, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Photo-production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important transformation process in marine carbon cycle, but little is known about this process in Chinese coastal systems. This study investigated an estuarine water sample and a coastal seawater sample from the subtropical waters in southeast of China. Water samples were exposed to natural sunlight and the absorption and fluorescence of CDOM as well as the DIC concentration were measured in the summer of 2009. The estuarine water had higher CDOM level, molecular weight and proportion of humic-like fluorescent components than the seawater that exhibited abundant tryptophan-like fluorescent component. After a 3-day irradiation, the CDOM level decreased by 45% in the estuarine water and 20% in the seawater, accompanied with a decrease in the molecular weight and aromaticity of DOM which was inferred from an increase in the absorption spectral slope parameter. The photo-degradation rates of all the five fluorescent components were also notable, in particular two humic-like components (C4 and C5) were removed by 78% and 69% in the estuarine water and by 69% and 56% in the seawater. The estuarine water had a higher photo-production rate of DIC than the seawater (4.4 vs. 2.5 mu mol/(L.day)), in part due to its higher CDOM abundance. The differences in CDOM compositions between the two types of waters might be responsible for the higher susceptibility of the estuarine water to photo-degradation and hence could also affect the photo-production process of DIC.

A molecular perspective on the ageing of marine dissolved organic matter	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) from 137 water samples from different climate zones and different depths along an eastern Atlantic Ocean transect. The extracts were analyzed with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI). Delta C-14 analyses were performed on subsamples of the SPE-DOM. In addition, the amount of dissolved organic carbon was determined for all water and SPE-DOM samples as well as the yield of amino sugars for selected samples. Linear correlations were observed between the magnitudes of 43% of the FT-ICR mass peaks and the extract Delta C-14 values. Decreasing SPE-DOM Delta C-14 values went along with a shift in the molecular composition to higher average masses (m/z) and lower hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratios. The correlation was used to model the SPE-DOM Delta C-14 distribution for all 137 samples. Based on single mass peaks, a degradation index (I-DEG) was developed to compare the degradation state of marine SPE-DOM samples analyzed with FT-ICR MS. A correlation between Delta C-14, IDEG, DOC values and amino sugar yield supports that SPE-DOM analyzed with FT-ICR MS reflects trends of bulk DOM. DOM weighted normalized mass peak magnitudes were used to compare aged and recent SPE-DOM on a semi-quantitative molecular basis. The magnitude comparison showed a continuum of different degradation rates for the detected compounds. A high proportion of the compounds should persist, possibly modified by partial degradation, in the course of thermohaline circulation. Prokaryotic (bacterial) production, transformation and accumulation of this very stable DOM occur primarily in the upper ocean. This DOM is an important contribution to very old DOM, showing that production and degradation are dynamic processes.

Spectrofluorimetric study of dissolved organic matter in River Salaca (Latvia) basin waters	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters influences mineral weathering, nutrient cycling, aggregation of particulate matter and photochemical reactions in waters and aquatic communities. In this study, the effectiveness of UV and fluorescence measurements in distinguishing the origin of DOM and processes within the river basin were analyzed using the River Salaca basin as an example. The basin of River Salaca is characterized by low anthropogenic pressure, however, the water color during the last few decades has increased (an effect known as brownification). As tools to study the composition of dissolved organic substances in waters of the River Salaca and its tributaries the use of UV and fluorescence spectroscopy was evaluated. The use of the fluorescence index (a ratio of the emission intensity at a wavelength of 450 nm to that at 500 nm) allowed us to distinguish sources of aquatic DOM, characterize processes in the water body basin and to follow the changes in organic matter composition. Synchronous scan fluorescence spectrometry was more informative than excitation emission spectra and, provided information on the basic structural features of DOM.																	1961-9502						2012		404							06	10.1051/kmae/2011086						WOS:000305142300006

The microbial humic quinone and amino acid components identified indicate the importance of microbially mediated processes in the reduction of iron oxyhydroxides. The relationship of quinone and amino acid-like components with Fe2+ and S2- helps us understand the sequential redox transformation (SRT) in the high arsenic aquifer system and the origin of bicarbonate in groundwater. Correlation between DOM components and dissolved arsenic and Fe suggests that arsenic mobilization could be linked to the microbial reduction of iron oxyhydroxides with liable DOM as electron donors as well as to the electron shuttling function served by humic quinones.																	1093-4529						2012	47	10					1446	1454		10.1080/10934529.2012.672390						WOS:000304308200012	22571533

Absorption coefficient a (355) in the degradation experiment was reduced 27.44%, however, in the control experiment, a (355) was only 1.61% lower. In the photodegradation process of degradation experiments and control experiments, the values of M and S were increased to the different extent and the increased value of the former was higher than the latter. By using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (EEMS), the detected peak value of protein-and humic fluorescence in control experiments was little changed, while significantly increased in the degradation experiments. By the analysis of parallel factor model (PARAFAC) combined with three-dimensional fluorescence excitation - emission matrix data (EEMS), the three-component CDOM: C 1, C2, C3, respectively were relative to humic fluorescence peaks A, C, and protein-like fluorescence B. In the degradation experiments, small changes were in the components of C 1, however the components of C2, C3 compared with those in the control group were increased by nearly 2 times. All results showed that the photodegradation process of bristles algae liquid can cause changes of the CDOM in the structure and content, easier to produce small molecules and weak aromatic CDOM.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-267-5				2012	356-360		1-5				2536	2541		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.356-360.2536						WOS:000302888301138

Tracing the transport of colored dissolved organic matter in water masses of the Southern Beaufort Sea: relationship with hydrographic characteristics	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Light absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) [a(CDOM)(lambda)] plays an important role in the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean, contributing to the recent decline in sea ice, as well as in biogeochemical processes. We investigated a(CDOM)(lambda) in the Southern Beaufort Sea where a significant amount of CDOM is delivered by the Mackenzie River. In the surface layer, a(CDOM)(440) showed a strong and negative correlation with salinity, indicating strong river influence and conservative transport in the river plume. Below the mixed layer, a weak but positive correlation between a(CDOM)(440) and salinity was observed above the upper halocline, resulting from the effect of removal of CDOM due to brine rejection and lateral intrusion of Pacific summer waters into these layers. In contrast, the relationship was negative in the upper and the lower haloclines, suggesting these waters originated from Arctic coastal waters. DOC concentrations in the surface layer were strongly correlated with a(CDOM)(440) (r(2) = 0.97), suggesting that this value can be estimated in this area, using a(CDOM)(440) that is retrieved using satellite ocean color data. Implications for estimation of DOC concentrations in surface waters using ocean color remote sensing are discussed.																	1726-4170						2012	9	3					925	940		10.5194/bg-9-925-2012						WOS:000302179500004		
J	Chen, H; Zheng, BH				Chen, Hao; Zheng, Binghui			Characterizing natural dissolved organic matter in a freshly submerged catchment (Three Gorges Dam, China) using UV absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and PARAFAC	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This study applied parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) of natural water samples in a freshly submerged catchment in the upper reach of Three Gorges Dam (China). Two fluorescent natural dissolved organic matter (NDOM) components (humic/fulvic-like) were uncovered and were positively correlated with selected water quality parameters, i.e. dissolved oxygen concentration, dissolved organic carbon concentration, dissolved Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration and total (dissolved plus particulate) phosphorus concentration, respectively. To other water quality parameters (i.e. total nitrogen, particulate nitrogen, particulate phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus, dissolved nitrate, pH, and chemical oxygen demand), either the two components did not show any correlation or only one component showed correlation. In particular, particulate N correlated significantly to the fulvic acid, but not to the humic acid. Meanwhile, two conventional spectroscopic indices i.e. specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and fluorescence index (FI) indicated that the whole NDOM in the waters were low in aromaticity and predominantly derived from aquatic microbial processes. Given together, it concludes that N and P did not function equally in the NDOM production, and the two components were not derived from the same microbial processes. The EEMs-PARAFAC has proven to be of potential as an effective tool in investigation of the interlink between NDOM and nutrients which may be utilized as an indicator of water environment.																	0273-1223						2012	65	5					962	969		10.2166/wst.2012.939						WOS:000300634800024	22339034

These correlations were analyzed on the basis of the raw water quality and the chemical and physical fractionations of DOM of thirteen Chinese source waters over three seasons. It was found that the final pH after enhanced coagulation for each of the four coagulants was influenced by the content of removable DOM (i.e. hydrophobic and higher apparent molecular weight (AMW) DOM), the alkalinity and the initial pH of raw water. A set of feed-forward semi-empirical models relating the final pH after enhanced coagulation for each of the four coagulants with the raw water characteristics were developed and optimized based on correlation analysis. The established models were preliminarily validated for prediction purposes, and it was found that the deviation between the predicted data and actual data was low. This result demonstrated the potential for the application of these models in practical operation of drinking water treatment plants.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2012	24	2					276	283		10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60717-1						WOS:000300653300014	22655388

Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) decomposed the fluorescence matrices into four humic-like components (Cl, C3, C4, and C5), one protein-like component (C2) and an unknown component (C6). As pH values of the sample increased from the initial value of 5. 7 to 10. 7, the fluorescence intensities of C1, C3, and C5 also increased, while those of C4 and C6 decreased gradually, resulting in an increasing contribution of humic-like components to total fluorescence. The opposite trend was observed when pH decreased to more acidic conditions and the unknown component (<250, 330/386 nm) became dominant. The relative contribution of the protein-like component to the total fluorescence remained more or less constant as pH varied. In addition, the fluorescence index (FI), humification index (HIX) and the index of recent autochthonous contribution (BIX) were also affected by pH perturbation. It is therefore recommended that the pH of rainwater samples should be measured and reported in future studies to effectively evaluate such "pH effects" on rainwater DOM fluorescence characteristics.

Exposure of dissolved organic matter to UV-radiation increases bacterial growth efficiency in a clear-water Alpine stream and its adjacent groundwater	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In many streams, microbial growth largely relies on terrigenous organic carbon that has been initially stored in soils and that is generally believed to be recalcitrant to microbial metabolism. The various mechanisms that underlie the availability of terrigenous organic carbon as it enters streams remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism can be photodegradation of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) upon exposure to sunlight in streamwater. To explore this, we experimentally exposed streamwater, shallow groundwater and soil water from a clear-water Alpine headwater stream, and both soil and algal extracts, to UV-radiation and studied the effects on DOC optical properties and implications for microbial growth. Our results on the apparent quantum yield suggest that DOC from groundwater and soil water is more resistant to photodegradation than DOC in the streamwater itself. This would highlight the relevance of the exposure history of DOC to sunlight. Overall, UV-radiation decreased the aromaticity (as SUVA254) of the DOC and reduced its molecular weight as indicated by the slope ratio, S (R) (S (275-295)/S (350-400)). UV-treatment significantly increased bacterial growth rate and bacterial growth efficiency in the streamwater, soil water, groundwater and soil extract but not in algal extract. Our findings suggest photodegradation as one mechanism that contributes to the microbial utilisation of terrigenous DOC even in clear-water streams.

Process analysis and economics of drinking water production from coastal aquifers containing chromophoric dissolved organic matter and bromide using nanofiltration and ozonation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In regions characterized by water scarcity, such as coastal Southern California, groundwater containing chromophoric dissolved organic matter is a viable source of water supply. In the coastal aquifer of Orange County in California, seawater intrusion driven by coastal groundwater pumping increased the concentration of bromide in extracted groundwater from 0.4 mg l(-1) in 2000 to over 0.8 mg l(-1) in 2004. Bromide, a precursor to bromate formation is regulated by USEPA and the California Department of Health as a potential carcinogen and therefore must be reduced to a level below 10 mu g l(-1). This paper compares two processes for treatment of highly coloured groundwater: nanofiltration and ozone injection coupled with biologically activated carbon. The requirement for bromate removal decreased the water production in the ozonation process to compensate for increased maintenance requirements, and required the adoption of catalytic carbon with associated increase in capital and operating costs per unit volume. However, due to the absence of oxidant addition in nanofiltration processes, this process is not affected by bromide. We performed a process analysis and a comparative economic analysis of capital and operating costs for both technologies. Our results show that for the case studied in coastal Southern California, nanofiltration has higher throughput and lower specific capital and operating cost, when compared to ozone injection with biologically activate carbon. Ozone injection with biologically activated carbon, compared to nanofiltration, has 14% higher capital cost and 12% higher operating costs per unit water produced while operating at the initial throughput. Due to reduced ozone concentration required to accommodate for bromate reduction, the ozonation process throughput is reduced and the actual cost increase (per unit water produced) is 68% higher for capital cost and 30% higher for operations.

Distinguishing dynamics of dissolved organic matter components in a forested stream using kinetic enrichments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Traditional methods for investigating stream solute biogeochemistry measure longitudinal rates of uptake by increasing either the concentration or isotopic composition of solutes. These methods cannot be applied to dissolved organic matter (DOM) because we cannot replicate the heterogeneous native DOM pool. We explored an alternative approach, attempting to displace or enhance benthic uptake of native DOM by supplying an exogenous source of labile carbon or by enriching the stream with inorganic nitrogen. This approach allows us to measure uptake rates of enriched solutes, as well as changes in the concentration and composition of native DOM resulting from the experimental manipulations. We examined DOM composition using fluorescence characterization. We were able to elicit changes in the chemical composition of native DOM by differentially altering the dynamics of autotrophic production and heterotrophic uptake within the second- order reach of Walker Branch, a well- studied stream in eastern Tennessee. Supplying heterotrophs with labile carbon resulted in an increase in fluorescence associated with terrestrially derived DOM. Stimulating algae by adding inorganic nitrogen increased autochthonous production and indirectly displaced heterotrophic demand for terrestrial DOM due to increased in- stream production of bioavailable DOM. While we were able to alter the composition of the native DOM pool, we observed little change in DOM concentrations. The ability to differentiate between DOM subcomponents provides insight into processes controlling DOM production and consumption that cannot be gained by treating DOM as a single bulk pool.

Spatial Variation in the Optical Properties of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) in Lakes on the Canadian Precambrian Shield and Links to Watershed Characteristics	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												In the present study, we explored the use of various optical parameters to detect differences in the composition of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a set of lakes that are all located on the Canadian Precambrian Shield, but within which Cu and Ni speciation predictions were previously shown to diverge from measured values in some lakes but not in others. Water samples were collected with in situ diffusion samplers in 2007 (N = 18 lakes) and 2008 (N = 8 lakes). Significant differences in DOM quality were identified between the sampling regions (Rouyn-Noranda, Qu,bec and Sudbury, Ontario) and among lakes, based on dissolved organic carbon concentrations ([DOC]), specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), fluorescence indices (FI), and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence measurements. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of the EEM spectra revealed four components, two of which (C3, oxidized quinone fluorophore of allochthonous origin, and C4, tryptophan-like protein fluorescence of autochthonous origin) showed the greatest inter-regional variation. The inter-lake differences in DOM quality were consistent with the regional watershed characteristics as determined from satellite imagery (e.g., watershed-to-lake surface area ratios and relative percentages of surface water, rock outcrops vegetative cover and urban development). Source apportionment plots, built upon PARAFAC components ratios calculated for our lakes, were used to discriminate among DOM sources and to compare them to sources identified in the literature. These results have implications for other areas of research, such as quantifying lake-to-lake variations in the influence of organic matter on the speciation of trace elements in natural aquatic environments.

J	Engel, A; Handel, N				Engel, Anja; Haendel, Nicole			A novel protocol for determining the concentration and composition of sugars in particulate and in high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM) in seawater	MARINE CHEMISTRY												A method is described to simultaneously determine the neutral, amino, and acidic sugar content of combined carbohydrates in high molecular weight (HMW, >1 kDa) dissolved organic matter and in particles from seawater samples. Monomeric sugars are determined after acid hydrolysis and neutralization through acid evaporation using high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). The separation of sugars during chromatography is achieved in two steps, an isocratic elution (18 mM NaOH) followed by a gradient course of two mobile eluent phases (NaOH and CH3COONa). HPAEC-PAD has previously been applied to measure neutral and amino sugars in marine samples. Since salt anions interfere with the measurement, some of the earlier studies used ion exchange resins for seawater desalting. Thereby, variable losses of neutral and amino sugars, and the complete removal of acidic sugars have been reported. Here, we show that desalting by membrane dialysis (1 kDa) is an efficient alternative to ion exchange resins and yields recoveries of >90% for HMW carbohydrates. We conducted several tests to determine the accuracy and reproducibility of the method. Sugar concentrations determined with our protocol were compared to results obtained with the colorimetric TPTZ-method, and with earlier HPAEC-PAD protocols using cation/anion exchange resins. Applications of our protocol to field samples indicated that acidic sugars can comprise a substantial fraction (30-50%) of HMW dissolved carbohydrates in seawater. The simultaneous analysis of the three classes of sugars appears promising to detect a larger fraction of marine combined carbohydrates, and thus to improve our understanding of organic matter cycling in the ocean.

Photoproduction rates for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were measured in the laboratory using a pre-column 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivitization HPLC method as a function of optical properties (absorption coefficient, spectral slope) and irradiation time. Rates decreased linearly with decreasing absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350 nm)), a measure of CDOM levels, with substantial variability in low a(350 nm) beach waters. Apparent quantum yields (Theta) were unchanged for a(350 nm)= 2-16 m(-1), but increased rapidly (x5) for beach waters with low a(350 nm) values. Theta increased linearly with increasing spectral slope for beach waters, consistent with enhanced production efficiency with photobleaching of CDOM in coastal waters. Theta trends with oxygen and molecular reaction probes (hydroxyl radical scavengers and producers) suggested a combination of direct photolysis and singlet oxygen quenching as primary production mechanisms.

In this study, removal and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the system were investigated in laboratory-scale experiments. Results demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon and trihalomethane formation potential values could be reduced from 6.54 +/- 1.30 mg/L and 267.9 +/- 24.3 mu g/L to 1.59 +/- 0.64 mg/L and 104.5 +/- 10.2 mu g/L, respectively, as a result of DOM biodegradation in the aerobic short-term vadose soil treatment. Fluorescence spectra showed that aromatic protein-like substances and soluble microbial byproducts could be removed, to a great extent, in the soil system. Despite different removal efficiencies of DOM in different molecular weight fractions, the residual DOM was composed mainly of fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like substances, with molecular weights of 500 Da to 1 kDa.

These samples were then fractionated according to their hydrophobicity. DOM fractions consisted of nanomolar to sub-micromolar fresh organic substances with extremely strong Hg-complexing ligands. The conditional stability constants (i.e. K-HgL'; pH similar to 6.8, I-NaCl = 0.5 M, T = 25 degrees C) of the Hg-DOM complexes formed were greater than 10(24) M (1), for the reaction Hg2+ + L = HgL (with L as ligand). For upstream of Paris, thermodynamic calculations indicated that the vast majority of Hg-DOM was associated with hydrophobic DOM. In contrast, in the Paris main wastewater treatment plant effluents, Hg-DOM was mainly bound to hydrophilic DOM. Simple dilution calculations highlighted that due to the large DOM loading of urban discharges, the hydrophilic urban DOM ligands may commonly dominate Hg-DOM speciation in the downstream Seine River, except under extreme dilution (i.e. high water episodes or floods).

Concentrations and spectral properties of DOM, as reflected by UV/visible absorbance and fluorescence, were strikingly similar at 26 sites sampled along transects near two western and two eastern areas of Barataria Bay in July and September 2010. In September 2010, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was significantly higher (568.1-1043 mu M C. x = 755.6 +/- 117.7 mu M C. n = 14) than in July 2010(249.1-577.1 mu M C, x = 383.7 +/- 98.31 mu M C. n = 14); conversely, Abs(254) was consistently higher at every site in July (0.105-0.314) than in September (0.080-0.221), averaging 0.24 +/- 0.06 in July and 0.15 +/- 0.04 in September. Fluorescence data via the fluorescence index (FI(450/500)) revealed that only 30% (8 of 26) of the July samples had an FI(450/500) above 1.36, compared to 96% (25 of 26) for the September samples. This indicates a more terrestrial origin for the July DOM. Bacterioplankton from eastern sites differed in composition from bacterioplankon in western sites in July. These differences appeared to result from reduced salinities caused by the freshwater diversion. Bacterioplankton communities in September differed from those in July, but no spatial structure was observed. Thus, the trends in bacterioplankton and DOM were likely due to changes in water masses (e.g., input of Mississippi River water in July and a return to estuarine waters in September). Discharge of water from the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion (DPFD) through Barataria Bay may have partially mitigated some adverse effects of the oil spill, inasmuch as DOM is concerned.

The method is based on a fast solid phase extraction of the freely dissolved fraction of a solute when the solution is flushed through a polymer-coated capillary. The extraction interferes with the solute DOM sorption equilibrium and drives the desorption process. Solutes which remain sorbed to DOM pass through the extraction capillary and can be analyzed afterward. This technique allows a time resolution for the desorption kinetics from subseconds up to minutes. It is applicable to the study of interaction kinetics between a wide variety of hydrophobic solutes and polyelectrolytes. Due to its simplicity it is accessible for many environmental laboratories. The time-resolved in-tube solid-phase microextraction (TR-IT-SPME) was applied to two humic acids and a surfactant as sorbents together with pyrene, phenanthrene and 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane as solutes. The results give evidence for a two-phase desorption kinetics: a fast desorption step with a half-life of less than 1 s and a slow desorption step with a half-life of more than 1 min. For aliphatic solutes, the fast-desorbing fraction largely dominates, whereas for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as pyrene, the slowly desorbing, stronger-bound fraction is also important.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 1	2011	45	23					10013	10019		10.1021/es2023835						WOS:000297382700029	22035249

Characterisation of colored dissolved organic matter in Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait using parallel factor analysis	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Composition and concentration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been determined in Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait by excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEM) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Based on 63 surface samples, PARAFAC identified three fluorescent components, which were attributed to two humic- and one protein-like components. One humic-like component was identified as representing terrestrial organic matter and showed a conservative behaviour in Hudson Bay estuaries. The second humic-like component, traditionally identified as peak M, originated both from land and produced in the marine environment. Component 3 had spectra resembling protein-like material and thought to be plankton-derived. The distribution and composition of CDOM were largely controlled by water mass mixing with protein-like component being the least affected. Distinctive fluorescence patterns were also found between Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, suggesting different sources of CDOM. The optically active fraction of DOC (both absorbing and fluorescing) was very high in the Hudson Bay (up to 89%) suggesting that fluorescence and absorbance can be used as proxies of the DOC concentration.

Lakes as buffers of stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) variability: Temporal patterns of DOM characteristics in mountain stream-lake systems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] Lakes within fluvial networks may affect dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in streams by dampening spring DOM snowmelt flushing responses and/or by increasing summer DOM production. We assessed the temporal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM characteristics (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)); DOC: dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC: DON)), as well as DOC export in seven paired lake inflows and outflows in the Sawtooth Mountain lake district, Idaho. We hypothesized that lakes would decrease stream DOM temporal variability and increase DOM export as a result of autotrophic production. We correlated DOM variability with landscape factors to evaluate potential drivers of DOM temporal patterns (measured as coefficient of variation). Coefficients of variation were 40-90% higher in lake inflows than outflows for DOC concentrations, characteristics, and DOC: DON. Increases in DOC concentrations on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph were greater in lake inflows than outflows, and on average mean DOC flux occurred 5.4 days earlier in the inflows than for the outflows. During base flow, mean outflow DOC concentrations were 1.7 times greater than inflows, and six outflows had higher annual export than inflows. Combined, these results illustrate that lakes alter the magnitude, timing and temporal variation of DOM concentration and characteristics exported from subalpine watersheds. This buffering effect results from a seasonal shift in the balance between hydrological versus biological controls on DOC dynamics, where lakes act as a sink during the spring when hydrologic controls dominate watershed DOM transport and act as a DOM source during summer.

The introduction of an online degassing tube and a low-volume HPLC column helped to reduce the analytical time and increase the sensitivity of the SEC system. This study is the first in which linear calibration curves (R(2) > 0.99) were obtained for both UV absorbance and NDIR data for polystyrene sulfonate standards, which are the most suitable standards for molecular size analysis of aquatic humic substances as well as dissolved organic matter (DOM). Using the calibration curves, the molecular size distribution of DOM in water collected from Lake Kasumigaura and in pore water from lake sediments was estimated. Most of the DOM had a molecular weight less than 4000 Daltons (Da), and the amount of low-molecular-weight DOM (similar to 2000 Da) with low UV absorbance increased with depth in the sediment pore water. This result shows the importance of combining quantitative analysis by NDIR detection with qualitative analysis by UV detection to determine the chemical and physical properties of DOM. The possible sources and reactivity of DOM in Lake Kasumigaura and its sediment pore water are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence for the enhanced lability of dissolved organic matter following permafrost slope disturbance in the Canadian High Arctic	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Arctic landscapes are believed to be highly sensitive to climate change and accelerated disturbance of permafrost is expected to significantly impact the rate of carbon cycling. While half the global soil organic matter (SOM) is estimated to reside in Arctic soils, projected warmer temperatures and permafrost disturbance will release much of this SOM into waterways in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The spring thaw and subsequent flushing of soils releases the highest contributions of DOM annually but has historically been undersampled due to the difficulties of sampling during this period. In this study, passive samplers were placed throughout paired High Arctic watersheds during the duration of the 2008 spring flush in Nunavut, Canada. The watersheds are very similar with the exception of widespread active layer detachments (ALDs) that occurred within one of the catchments during a period of elevated temperatures in the summer of 2007. DOM samples were analyzed for structural and spectral characteristics via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as vulnerability to degradation with simulated solar exposure. Lignin-derived phenols were further assessed utilizing copper(II) oxide (CuO) oxidation and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The samples were found to have very low dissolved lignin phenol content (similar to 0.07% of DOC) and appear to originate from primarily non-woody angiosperm vegetation. The acid/aldehyde ratios for dissolved vanillyl phenols were found to be high (up to 3.6), indicating the presence of highly oxidized lignin. Differences between DOM released from the ALD vs. the undisturbed watershed suggest that these shallow detachment slides have significantly impacted the quality of Arctic DOM. Although material released from the disturbed catchment was found to be highly oxidized, DOM in the lake into which this catchment drained had chemical characteristics indicating high contributions from microbial and/or primary productivity. The resulting pool of dissolved carbon within the lake appears to be more biologically- and photochemically-labile than material from the undisturbed system. These disturbances may have implications for projected climate warming; sustained elevated temperatures would likely perpetuate widespread ALDs and further affect carbon cycling in this environment.

Influence of acidification on the optical properties and molecular composition of dissolved organic matter	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												Acidification is a common method for preserving dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural water samples until sophisticated laboratory analyses can be performed. However, little is known about the effects of this practice on the composition and optical properties of DOM. In this study, the effects of acidification on DOM in porewater samples collected from the RL IV bog system of the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands in northern Minnesota were characterized. Molecular composition was determined by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and optical properties by UV absorption and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy results indicate that the fluorescence properties of the peatland porewater DOM were sensitive to pH and that the observed changes were fluorophore dependent. Ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry revealed the appearance of newly formed, oxygen-rich compounds upon acidification. The extent to which these oxygen-rich compounds were formed was also dependent on the composition of the DOM. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Climate, land use, and forest cover changes all impact stream DOM and alter biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial environments. We determined the temporal variation in DOM quantity and quality in headwater streams at a reference watershed (REF), a watershed clear-cut 30 years ago (CC), and a watershed converted to a white pine plantation 50 years ago (WP) at the US Forest Service, Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, in the Nantahala Mountains of western North Carolina, USA. Average stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in CC or WP were 60 and 80% of those in REF, respectively. Stream DOM composition showed that the difference was mainly due to changes in humic-ike components in chromophoric DOM. In addition, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence data with parallel factor analysis indicate that although the concentration of protein-like components did not differ significantly among watersheds, their relative abundance showed an enrichment in CC and WP compared to REF. The ratio of humic acid-type to fulvic acid-type components was highest and lowest at REF and WP, respectively. Our data suggest that forest ecosystem disturbance history affects the DOM quantity and quality in headwater streams over decades as a result of changes in watershed soil organic matter characteristics due to differences in organic matter inputs.

Dissolved organic matter composition and photoreactivity in prairie lakes of the U.S. Great Plains	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) of 27 prairie saline lake ecosystems was investigated in the Northern and Central Great Plains of the United States using absorbance, fluorescence, lignin concentration, and stable C isotope values. The majority of variation in DOM fluorescence among lakes was due to humic (peak C) and microbially formed (peak M) fluorescent components, which appear to be derived from autochthonous primary production. Strong correlations between peak M and nutrients allow us to model total phosphorus (TP) concentration using peak M fluorescence and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption. The rate of primary production (PP) was positively correlated with peak M fluorescence and negatively with lignin concentration. Lignin phenol yields in the DOM were generally smaller than those of most freshwater systems. delta C-13 values of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from -25.0% to -20.1% and were generally enriched relative to typical freshwaters (ca. -27%). Terrestrial DOM is degraded in prairie lakes, spanning a gradient from mixotrophic to eutrophic, as determined by a color-nutrient model. The photodegradation of autochthonous DOM was significant: CO2 fluxes from these prairie lakes, modeled from peak M fluorescence, ranged from 5 to 228 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) (median, 37 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) and was similar to community respiration estimated from protein fluorescence (median, 50 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). The combined estimates were about 50% of the global mean total C release previously reported for saline lake ecosystems. The implication of these new results is that the global C release from saline lake ecosystems is likely underestimated.

J	Hur, J; Lee, BM; Shin, HS				Hur, Jin; Lee, Bo-Mi; Shin, Hyun-Sang			Microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its influence on phenanthrene-DOM interactions	CHEMOSPHERE												Microbial degradation-induced changes in the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and the subsequent effects on phenanthrene-DOM interactions were investigated based on the microbial incubation of DOM collected from four different sources for 28 d. Partially biodegraded DOM presented higher specific UV absorbance (SUVA), lower protein-like fluorescence, higher humic-like fluorescence, lower aliphatic carbon fraction, and higher hydrophobic neutral fractions compared to the original DOM. Microbial changes in DOM led to an increase in the isotherm nonlinearity as well as the extent of phenanthrene binding. A negative relationship between SUVA and the Freundlich n values was established for the original and the biodegraded DOM, suggesting that aromatic condensed structures may play important roles in providing nonlinear strong binding sites irrespective of microbial degradation. In contrast, there were two separate slopes of the correlations between the percentage of hydrophobic acid (HoA) fraction and the n values for the original and the biodegraded DOM with a higher slope exhibited for the latter, implying that the microbial utilization of oxygen-containing structures in the HoA fractions may contribute to enhancing the associated isotherm nonlinearity.

Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Piaui River Estuary, Northeast Brazil	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Fluorescence spectroscopy and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements were used to characterize the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Piaui River estuary, a tropical estuary situated in the State of Sergipe, Northeast Brazil. Fluorescence intensities were greater during the rainy period than the dry period, demonstrating that variability in the fluorescence properties of the DOM was determined mainly by the fluvial discharge and the dilution processes occurring in the estuary. During the rainy period, tryptophan-like and humic substances were the main components of the DOM, while during the dry period there was a significant increase of protein-like constituents. Relationships identified between fluorescence intensities and salinity were indicative of non-conservative behavior of the fluorescent DOM. DOC showed behavior that was conservative during the dry period, and non-conservative during the rainy period, with production of DOC in the upper reaches of the estuary. The complexation of DOM with Cu(II), studied using the fluorescence suppression technique, showed the complexation potentials of protein, tryptophan and humic type fluorophores.

In this work, we examined the net uptake and release of CDOM by a natural bacterial community growing on DOM derived from four phytoplankton species cultured under axenic conditions. Fluorescent humic-like substances exuded by phytoplankton (excitation/emission [Ex/Em] wavelength, 310 nm/392 nm; Coble's peak M) were utilized by bacteria in different proportions depending on the phytoplankton species of origin. Furthermore, bacteria produced humic-like substances that fluoresce at an Ex/Em wavelength of 340 nm/440 nm (Coble's peak C). Differences were also observed in the Ex/Em wavelengths of the protein-like materials (Coble's peak T) produced by phytoplankton and bacteria. The induced fluorescent emission of CDOM produced by prokaryotes was an order of magnitude higher than that of CDOM produced by eukaryotes. We have also examined the final compositions of the bacterial communities growing on the exudates, which differed markedly depending on the phytoplankton species of origin. Alteromonas and Roseobacter were dominant during all the incubations on Chaetoceros sp. and Prorocentrum minimum exudates, respectively. Alteromonas was the dominant group growing on Skeletonema costatum exudates during the exponential growth phase, but it was replaced by Roseobacter afterwards. On Micromonas pusilla exudates, Roseobacter was replaced by Bacteroidetes after the exponential growth phase. Our work shows that fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of CDOM can be a helpful tool for the identification of microbial sources of DOM in the marine environment, but further studies are necessary to explore the association of particular bacterial groups with specific fluorophores.

The results, showed that the components of DOM in water from different lake areas displayed some regional characteristics. The contents of macro-molecules matters with complex structures and humic substances in water from sampling points T1 (locates in the inflow river) and T2 (represents Zhu Shan Bay Lake) were in majority. This indicated that these areas were subjected to multiple sources, including biological sources, land-based sources, and domestic sewage. In the meanwhile, the complexities of DOM from sampling points T3 (Meiliang Bay Lake), T4 (Gonghu Bay Lake), and T5 (center of Taihu Lake) were relatively low. And protein-like materials with simple structures were in majority in water from sampling point T6 (East Taihu Lake), which suggested that this area was less influenced by the external environment.

The lower Kishon River typifies streams that are affected by seawater tidal intrusion and represents an extreme case of severe long-term pollution caused mainly by a variety of industrial effluents. The industrial effluents may contribute about 90%, in terms of biochemical oxygen demand, of the total organic carbon discharged into the lower Kishon River. Water samples were collected along the river, including the points of effluent discharge from industrial plants, between November 2005 and September 2006. Two types of fluorescent components characterized the fluorescence of the lower Kishon River water: component I corresponded to humic-like matter and component II spectrally resembled material known to be associated with biological productivity, but different from typical tryptophan-like fluorophore. These fluorescent components and other substances that absorbed light at 254 nm contributed to the DOC pool that resisted riverine microbial degradation under laboratory conditions, and that constitutes up to 70% of the overall riverine DOC. The variations in DOC concentration, absorbance at 254 nm, and concentration of humic-like matter (characterized by component I) correlated with the distance from the sea and the water electrical conductivity, and were linked to seawater tidal intrusion. The increased concentration of component II, as well as its enlarged fraction in the overall riverine DOC pool, was found to be associated with the location of major inputs of the industrial effluents. These findings support the use of this fluorescent component as an indicator of industrial pollution in such severely contaminated riverine systems.																	0049-6979					NOV	2011	222	1-4					255	269		10.1007/s11270-011-0821-x						WOS:000296632900018

Variation in Optical Properties of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter in A Shallow Lake During Rainy Season	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Variation in optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a shallow lake during rainy season was investigated by UV/VIS absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Two humic-like components mainly from terrestrial origin (C1 and C2) and one protein-like component derived from autochthonous production (C3) were identified by applying fluorescence excitation-emission matrix combined with PARAFAC modeling. The mean values of autochthonous production and chlorophyll concentration increased from 0.28 to 0.30 mu g/L and 165 to 197 mu g/L, respectively. Their correlation was different in temporal pattern, demonstrating that the dominant source of autochthonous chromophoric dissolved organic matter was altered from phytoplankton to other sources such as release from sediment and runoff during the rainy season. Mean values of Cl and C2 increased significantly from 0.36 and 0.35 to 0.42 and 0.37 respectively, coupled with a (355) increasing from 2.86 m(-1) to 3.86 m(-1) suggesting that precipitation process may increase terrestrial chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the lake. The low values of humification index (HIX) ranging from 3.52 to 4.62 were caused by the dominant origin of autochthonous chromophoric dissolved organic matter, although input of terrestrially-derived chromophoric dissolved organic matter could make mean value of humification index increase from 3.82 to 4.35.

Partitioning of dissolved organic matter-bound mercury between a hydrophobic surface and polysulfide-rubber polymer	WATER RESEARCH												This study investigated the role of dissolved organic matter on mercury partitioning between a hydrophobic surface (polyethylene, PE) and a reduced sulfur-rich surface (polysulfide rubber, PSR). Comparative sorption studies employed polyethylene and polyethylene coated with PSR for reactions with DOM-bound mercuric ions. These studies revealed that PSR enhanced the Hg-DOM removal from water when DOM was Suwannee River natural organic matter (NOM), fulvic acid (FA), or humic acid (HA), while the same amount of 1,3-propanedithiol-bound mercuric ion was removed by both PE and PSR-PE. The differences for Hg-DOM removal efficiencies between PE and PSR-PE varied depending on which DOM was bound to mercuric ion as suggested by the PE/water and PSR-PE/water partition coefficients for mercury. The surface concentrations of mercury on PE and PSR-PE with the same DOM measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were similar, which indicated the comparable amounts of immobilized mercury on PE and PSR-PE being exposed to the aqueous phase. With these observations, two major pathways for the immobilization reactions between PSR-PE and Hg-DOM were examined: 1) adsorption of Hg-DOM on PE by hydrophobic interactions between DOM and PE, and 2) addition reaction of Hg-DOM onto PSR by a complexation reaction between Hg and PSR. The percent contribution of each pathway was derived from a mass balance and the ratios among aqueous mercury, PE-bound Hg-DOM, and PSR-bound Hg-DOM concentrations. The results indicate strong binding of mercuric ion with both dissolved organic matter and PSR polymer. The FT-IR examination of Hg-preloaded-PSR-PEs after the reaction with DOM corroborated a strong interaction between mercuric ion and 1,3-propanedithiol compared to Hg-HA, Hg-FA, or Hg-NOM interactions.

Perennial ponds are not an important source of water or dissolved organic matter to groundwaters with high arsenic concentrations in West Bengal, India	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arsenic (As) concentrations and stable hydrogen (delta(2)H) and oxygen (delta(18)O) isotope ratios of surface and groundwaters from a representative site in West Bengal, India, are reported. Shallow groundwaters (<= 35 m) from the study site have among the highest As concentrations measured in the entire Bengal Basin, reaching values in excess of 4600 mu g kg(-1). Stable isotope ratios of waters from constructed, perennial ponds indicate the ponds are chiefly recharged during the summer monsoon, and subsequently undergo extensive evaporation during the dry (winter) season. In contrast, groundwaters with high As concentrations plot along the local meteoric water line (LMWL) near where the annual, volume-weighted mean precipitation values for delta(2)H and delta(18)O would plot. The stable isotope data demonstrate that groundwaters are directly recharged by local precipitation without significant evaporation, and thus are not recharged by, nor mixed with, the pond waters. Furthermore, reactive transport modeling indicates that dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from pond waters does not fuel microbial respiration and As mobilization at depth in the underlying aquifer because travel times for pond-derived DOM exceed groundwater ages by thousands of years. Instead, organic matter within the aquifer sediments must drive dissimilatory iron reduction and As release to groundwaters. Citation: Datta, S., A. W. Neal, T. J. Mohajerin, T. Ocheltree, B. E.

To investigate how the source and composition of CDOM changes in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and fluorescence analyses to characterize CDOM in Lake Tianmuhu (a drinking water source) and its catchment in China. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified three individual fluorophore moieties that were attributed to humic-like and protein-like materials in 224 water samples collected between December 2008 and September 2009. The upstream rivers contained significantly higher concentrations of CDOM than did the lake water (a(350) of 4.27 +/- 2.51 and 2.32 +/- 0.59 m(-1), respectively), indicating that the rivers carried a substantial load of organic matter to the lake. Of the three main rivers that flow into Lake Tianmuhu, the Pingqiao River brought in the most CDOM from the catchment to the lake. CDOM absorption and the microbial and terrestrial humic-like components, but not the protein-like component, were significantly higher in the wet season than in other seasons, indicating that the frequency of rainfall and runoff could significantly impact the quantity and quality of CDOM collected from the catchment. The different relationships between the maximum fluorescence intensities of the three PARAFAC components, CDOM absorption, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration in riverine and lake water indicated the difference in the composition of CDOM between Lake Tianmuhu and the rivers that feed it. This study demonstrates the utility of combining excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and PARAFAC to study CDOM dynamics in inland waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

THE DYNAMICS OF FLUORESCENT DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER IN THE PARANAGUA ESTUARINE SYSTEM, SOUTHERN BRAZIL	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in Paranagua Estuarine System (PES) as to infer about the contribution of allochthonous FDOM to the estuarine waters in relation to tidal condition and seasons. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used for such purpose and DOM characterization through fluorescence emission was performed using excitation wavelengths of lambda ex 350 nm and lambda ex 450 nm, the two main fluorescence groups known to be present in natural DOM. Relations between emission wavelength (lambda em) and environmental variables, and the relevance of these variables to the different tides and seasons were identified by principal component analysis. The results showed that the first class of fluorophores (lambda ex 350 nm) changed from the river (freshwater) towards the estuary, whilst the second class (lambda ex 450 nm) has a more conservative nature and does not change as significantly as the first. Allochthonous DOM contribution to the estuarine system is intensified during the rainy season, especially in spring tides, whereas in the dry season the ratio of autochthonous DOM to total DOM in PES waters increased. We concluded that the variation of maximum lambda em of the first class of fluorophores (lambda ex 350 nm) is mainly related to allochthonous contribution, whilst the maximum of emission for the second class of fluorophores (lambda ex 450 nm) is dependent on the contribution of the different sources of organic matter (freshwater and marine water DOM contribution).

J	Nguyen, HVM; Hur, J				Hang Vo-Minh Nguyen; Hur, Jin			Tracing the sources of refractory dissolved organic matter in a large artificial lake using multiple analytical tools	CHEMOSPHERE												Structural and chemical characteristics of refractory dissolved organic matter (RDOM) from seven different sources (algae, leaf litter, reed, compost, field soil, paddy water, treated sewage) were examined using multiple analytical tools, and they were compared with those of RDOM in a large artificial lake (Lake Paldang, Korea). Treated sewage, paddy water, and field soil were distinguished from the other sources investigated by their relatively low specific UV absorbance (SUVA) values and more pronounced fulvic-like versus humic-like fluorescence of the ROOM samples. Microbial derived RDOM from algae and treated sewage showed relatively low apparent molecular weight and a higher fraction of hydrophilic bases relative to the total hydrophilic fraction. For the biopolymer types, the presence of polyhydroxy aromatics with the high abundance of proteins was observed only for vascular plant-based RDOM (i.e., leaf litter and reed). Molecular weight values exhibited positive correlations with the SUVA and the hydrophobic content among the different RDOM, suggesting that hydrophobic and condensed aromatic structures may be the main components of high molecular weight RDOM. Principal component analysis revealed that approximately 77% of the variance in the RDOM characteristics might be explained by the source difference (i.e., terrestrial and microbial derived) and a tendency of further microbial transformation. Combined results demonstrated that the properties of the lake ROOM were largely affected by the upstream sources of field soil, paddy water, and treated sewage, which are characterized by low molecular weight UV-absorbing and non-aromatic structures with relatively high resistance to further degradation.

J	Massicotte, P; Frenette, JJ				Massicotte, Philippe; Frenette, Jean-Jacques			Spatial connectivity in a large river system: resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.																	1051-0761					OCT	2011	21	7					2600	2617								WOS:000296139200021	22073647

Assuming that remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) could be retrieved accurately, empirical algorithms for T(Chl) (regionally tuned Tassan's Chl-a algorithm) in case-1 waters (T(Chl)2i in case-2 waters), T(TSM) (regionally tuned Tassan's TSM algorithm), and T(ag440) or C(ag440) (regionally tuned Tassan's or Carder's ag(440) algorithm) were able to retrieve Chl-a, TSM, and ag(440) with uncertainties as high as 35, 46, and 35%, respectively. Applying the standard SeaWiFS Rrs, T(Chl) was not viable in the eastern part of the YECS, which was associated with an inaccurate SeaWiFS Rrs retrieval because of improper atmospheric correction. T(Chl) behaved better than other algorithms in the turbid case-2 waters, although overestimation was still observed. To retrieve more reliable Chl-a estimates with standard SeaWiFS Rrs in turbid water (a proxy for case-2 waters), we modified T(Chl) for data with SeaWiFS normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw(555)) > 2 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) (T(Chl)2s). Finally, with standard SeaWiFS Rrs, we recommend switching algorithms from T(Chl)2s (for case-2 waters) to MOC(Chl) (SeaWiFS-modified NASA OC4v4 standard algorithm for case-1 waters) for retrieving Chl-a, which resulted in uncertainties as high as 49%. To retrieve TSM and ag(440) using SeaWiFS Rrs, we recommend empirical algorithms for T(TSM) (pre-SeaWiFS-modified form) and MT(ag440) or MC(ag440) (SeaWiFS Rrs-modified forms of T(ag440) or C(ag440)). These could retrieve with uncertainties as high as 82 and 52%, respectively.

Characterisation of dissolved organic matter in Parisian urban aquatic systems: predominance of hydrophilic and proteinaceous structures	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Understanding the nature of organic matter is a necessary first step in assessing contaminant bioavailability and allowing water supply managers to optimise the treatment train in the aim of providing safe and inexpensive drinking water. This study provides further insight into the composition, structure and functional groups of dissolved organic matter (DOM) (both hydrophobic and hydrophilic) from urban aquatic systems by means of various analytical techniques (DAX-8/XAD-4 fractionation, elemental analysis, UV and FTIR spectroscopies, (13)C and (15)N isotopic analysis, size exclusion chromatography and Pyrolysis-GC-MS). The analytical range chosen for this study constitutes a powerful tool in the characterisation of DOM in urban water. The inclusion of information from one technique to the next might not only serve as a support to each one, but also as a complement. The DOM fraction from treated effluent and, more generally, DOM from urban water (i.e. receiving treated effluent) display a strong hydrophilic characteristic [i.e. low humic substance (HS) content, low SUVA], along with a high distribution in molecular weights observed by SEC and low average molecular weight. Due to the origin of this DOM, proteinaceous structures constitute the main compounds, as observed by FTIR and Py-GC-MS. Such characteristics (i.e. heterogeneity, low average molecular weight and diverse functional groups, which make up a total of N) could explain that DOM from treated effluent displayed a strong reactive potential metals pollutants as previously demonstrated.

This technique provides express results often by choosing one or two excitation-emission fluorescence measurement for a straight range of concentration. That why it is not representative of the whole sample. On another hand, using total luminescence spectra gives lots of information that is difficult to manipulate in term of complexing properties. This work focus on a fluorescence quenching experiment carried out on a filtered black water from Rio Negro from north Brazil (Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira) using excitation emission matrix of fluorescence (EEMF) with a large range of copper concentration. Indeed, metal additions were performed using logarithmic increments of the total copper concentration to cover a wide range of concentration from 1.7 x 10(-9) to 10(-3) mol l(-1). These data were treated by two different ways for comparison: on the one hand, data treatment were computed, as usually, at different fluorescence intensity positions using multi-response wavelength method with two ligand, and, on the another hand, a statistical method, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), was applied to extract fluorescent component. Then a fitting was done on these PARAFAC components with one or two complexing sites each one. Results show that PARAFAC enables quantitative evaluation of complexing parameters for copper as good as certain multi-response methods: L-1T 16.2 x 10(-6) mol l(-1) (5.0 < log(K-1) < 5.8) and L-2T 3.0 x 10(-4) mol l(-1) (2.8 < log(K-2) < 3.9). PARAFAC confirms that for this natural sample only two fluorescent ligands are present with two types of site for each component. No residual fluorescence was detected by the statistical treatment. Wall surface interferences were pointed-out as phenomenon to be solve to overcome the limiting efficiency of the total copper concentration range.

J	Barriuso, E; Andrades, MS; Benoit, P; Houot, S				Barriuso, Enrique; Andrades, Maria-Soledad; Benoit, Pierre; Houot, Sabine			Pesticide desorption from soils facilitated by dissolved organic matter coming from composts: experimental data and modelling approach	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) interaction with pesticides was examined studying the ability of DOM to desorb 8 pesticides previously sorbed to soil. DOM was originating from municipal waste composts at two maturity degrees, recovered at 20A degrees C and by hot-pressurised subcritical water. Pesticide desorption depended on their previous sorption on soil. When sorption was low (K(OC) a parts per thousand currency sign 50, sulcotrione, metalaxyl), water was more efficient than DOM for desorption. On the contrary, when sorption was high (K(OC) a parts per thousand yen 2000, trifluraline), little effect of DOM was observed. For the moderately sorbed pesticides, DOM favoured pesticide desorption compared to water. For the lowest sorbed pesticides (K(OC) a parts per thousand currency sign 100), hysteresis was increased with larger proportions of DOM extracted with subcritical-water. Dissolved organic matter extracted from fresh-immature compost had larger capacity to mobilize the sorbed pesticides than the DOM from the mature compost. The pesticide desorption resulted from the positive and competitive interactions between pesticide, DOM and soil surfaces. These interactions were modelled considering separate partitioning coefficients. A general equation allowed the deduction of specific coefficients describing interactions in solution between pesticides and the non-sorbed fraction of DOM remaining in solution. This fraction was supposed to contain the most hydrophilic fraction of DOM and was able to interact with the most polar pesticide (amitrol). When pesticide hydrophobicity increased, the partitioning between pesticide and DOM decreased. Modelling the three-phase system (liquid, DOM and solid phases) pointed out that the solid phase played the most important role on pesticide behaviour through the sorption process of DOM and pesticides.

DOM constituents were characterized using a suite of indices derived from ultraviolet absorbance and PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation emission matrices. Runoff sources and hydrologic flow paths were identified using an end-member mixing model, stable isotope data, and groundwater elevations from valley-bottom saturated areas. DOM constituents and their sources differed dramatically between base flow and storm-event conditions. The aromatic and humic DOM constituents in stream water increased significantly during storm events and were attributed to the contributions from surficial sources such as throughfall, litter leachate and soil water. Groundwater sources contributed a large fraction of the DOM constituents during base flow and were responsible for the high % protein-like fluorescence observed in base flow. Hydrologic flow paths and runoff sources were critical for explaining the differences in DOM among the storm events. This study underscored the value of studying multiple storm events across a range of hydrologic and seasonal conditions. Summer events produced the highest concentrations for humic and aromatic DOM while the corresponding response for winter events was muted. A large event following summer drought produced a complex DOM response which was not observed for the other events. These extreme events provided important insights into how DOM quality may change for future changes in climate and water quality implications for sensitive coastal ecosystems.

Horizontal and vertical distributions of colored dissolved organic matter during the Southern Ocean Gas Exchange Experiment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Field and remote sensing measurements of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were acquired in the Southern Ocean during the 2008 Gas Exchange experiment. Values of CDOM absorption coefficient at 440 nm (a(g)440) ranged from similar to 0.02 to similar to 0.06 m(-1). In general, CDOM was higher in the region sampled during this study than in other regions of the Southern Ocean. CDOM showed an inverse correlation with salinity, and the spectral slope parameter S varied directly with salinity. These relationships, water circulation patterns, and characteristics of South Georgia Island suggested that runoff was a source of CDOM in the study site. Analysis of seasonal variability of ag440 using ocean color imagery of areas away from the effect of South Georgia Island showed seasonal fluctuations between similar to 0.02 to similar to 0.03 m(-1). CDOM production models showed that in situ production could also account for seasonal changes in CDOM.

Influence of organic matter source and diagenetic state on photochemical release of dissolved organic matter and nutrients from resuspendable estuarine sediments	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Presently there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the influence of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) source and diagenetic state on photolytic fluxes of dissolved organic matter and nutrients from sediments likely to be resuspended during high energy events such as storms. Here we present data on the photochemical release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH(4)(+), and PO(4)(3-) from the fine fraction of sediments obtained along an estuarine gradient, coupled with analyses of biogeochemical and molecular indicators of SOM source. Photochemical release of DOC and PO(4)(3-) was significantly higher than dark controls at all sites. DOC photorelease from fine (<ca. 10-20 mu m) sediments was ten times higher than previous studies that used bulk sediment in suspensions. The magnitude, stoichiometry, and speciation of nutrients and dissolved organic matter released during sediment photolysis appear to be influenced by a combination of SOM source and diagenetic processing. Release of DOC and PO(4)(3-) was higher at upstream sites, where sediments were dominated by relatively unaltered terrestrially-derived SOM. In contrast, TDN, DON, and NH(4)(+) releases were higher at downstream sites, which exhibited more degraded organic matter of both terrestrial and aquatic origin. The ratio of inorganic nutrients released was low at all sites (NH(4)(+): PO(4)(3-) similar to 1-7) suggesting that SOM photolysis may be relatively more important as a source of inorganic P than N. Our results also demonstrate that SOM is broadly photolabile and that previous studies may underestimate photolytic release of DOC from the fine fraction of sediments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This ability has been used in the present study to investigate the characteristics and distribution of different DOM fractions. A unique global dataset revealed seven different fluorescent fractions of DOM: two humic-like, four amino acid-like and one chemically uncharacterized. The spectral characteristics of the amino acid-like fractions resemble those of pure tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. The fluorescence intensities of these amino acid-like fractions are highest in the surface waters, rapidly decreasing with depth and at a constant low level in the bathypelagic layer. Such profiles indicate that amino acid-like DOM is linked to surface water production. From calibration curves we estimated the mean surface water concentrations of tryptophan and tyrosine to be 12.5 and similar to 15.9 nmol L-1, respectively, while mean deep water concentrations are 5.1 and similar to 6.5 nmol L-1. The fluorescence intensities of the humic-like DOM fractions were low in the surface layer, rapidly increasing in the mesopelagic layer and at constant high level in the bathypelagic layer. The low fluorescence intensities observed in the surface layer indicate the quantitative importance of photochemical degradation as a sink of the humic-like compounds. In the dark ocean (below 200 m), significant linear relationships between humic-like DOM fluorescence and microbial activity (apparent oxygen utilization. NO3- and PO43-) were found. These observations imply a link to dark ocean microbial remineralization and indicate that the major source of humic-like compounds is microbial turnover of organic matter. The results of the present study show that the distribution of the humic-like DOM fractions is a balance between supply from continental run off, net microbial production and photochemical removal in surface waters.

Linking the chemical and optical properties of dissolved organic matter in the Baltic-North Sea transition zone to differentiate three allochthonous inputs	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Optical and chemical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were resolved in the mixing zone between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The results from four cruises undertaken from August 2006 to February 2007 are presented. Relationships between the optical (absorption and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved lignin concentrations were determined and carbon stable isotope values (delta C-13) of DOM were also used to evaluate DOM sources. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM), measured as absorption at 300 nm, was a strong predictor for DOC and lignin concentrations. The DOM fluorescence (FDOM) characteristics were modeled by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and a six component model was derived. The intensity of one terrestrial humic-like fluorescent component (Fmax3) was strongly correlated to dissolved lignin concentrations. DOC concentrations were best modeled by the combination of this component with an amino acid-like fluorescent component. A three end-member mixing model developed for the region using CDOM-salinity relationships was used to estimate end-member lignin and DOC concentrations, which produced results consistent with other published results from the region. The Baltic Sea outflow was determined to be the dominant source of dissolved lignin in these waters. Despite the high riverine influence in the Jutland Coastal Current:, the DOM originating from these waters contained little lignin and was predominantly autochthonous. Additionally CDOM and carbon stable isotope measurements revealed substantial autochthonous production in the Kattegat. Finally, we used the fluorescence-DOC relationships to estimate the net export of terrestrial C from the Baltic Sea at 0.8 Tg year(-1), which represents 45% of the calculated net DOC flux (1.7 Tg year(-1)).

Effects of dissolved organic matter from the rhizosphere of the hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii on sorption of zinc and cadmium by different soils	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the changes of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) and non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) of Sedum alfredii and its effects on Zn and Cd sorption by soils. After planted with HE, soil pH in the rhizosphere reduced by 0.5-0.6 units which is consistent with the increase of DOM. The hydrophilic fractions (51%) in DOM from the rhizosphere of HE (HE-DOM) was much greater than NHE-DOM (35%). In the presence of HE-DOM, Zn and Cd sorption capacity decreased markedly in the following order: calcareous clay loam > neutral clay loam > acidic silty clay. The sorption isotherms could be well described by the Freundlich equation (R(2) > 0.95), and the partition coefficient (K) in the presence of HE-DOM was decreased by 30.7-68.8% for Zn and 20.3-59.2% for Cd. as compared to NHE-DOM. An increase in HE-DOM concentration significantly reduced the sorption and increased the desorption of Zn and Cd by three soils. DOM derived from the rhizosphere of the hyperaccumulating ecotype of S. alfredii could significantly reduce metal sorption and increase its mobility through the formation of soluble DOM-metal complexes.

Large-volume ultrafiltration for the study of radiocarbon signatures and size vs. age relationships in marine dissolved organic matter	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In recent decades, tangential-flow ultrafiltration (UF) technology has become a primary tool for isolating large amounts of "ultrafiltered" marine dissolved organic carbon (UDOC; 0.1 mu m to similar to 1 nm) for the detailed characterization of DOC chemical composition and radiocarbon (Delta(14)C) signatures. However, while total DOC Delta(14)Cvalues are generally thought to be quite similar in the world ocean, previous studies have reported widely different Delta(14)C values for UDOC, even from very similar ocean regions, raising questions about the relative "reactivity" of high molecular weight (HMW) DOC. Specifically, to what degree do variations in DOM molecular weight (MW) vs. composition alter its relative persistence, and therefore HMW DOC Delta(14)C values? In this study we evaluate the effects of varying proportions of HMW vs. low molecular weight (LMW) DOC on UDOC Delta(14)C values. Using concentration factor (CF) as a proxy for MW distributions, we modeled the retention of both OC and Delta(14)C in several very large CF experiments (CF >3000), from three depths (20, 670, and 915 m) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). The resulting DOC and Delta(14)C UF permeation coefficients generally increase with depth, consistent with mass balance trends, indicating very significant permeation of LMW, (14)C-depleted DOC at depth, and higher recoveries of Delta(14)C-enriched, HMW DOC in the surface. In addition, changes in CF during sample concentration and ionic strength during sample diafiltration had very large and predictable impacts on UDOC Delta(14)C values. Together these results suggest that previously reported disparities in UDOC Delta(14)C values are reconciled by linked trends of Delta(14)C content vs. MW. At low CFs, UDOC samples have similar Delta(14)C values to total DOC. In contrast, UDOC samples collected at extremely high CFs (and after diafiltration) have more positive Delta(14)C values. We demonstrate that the observed relationships between UDOC Delta(14)C and CF derived from our data can directly explain offsets in all previously published UDOC Delta(14)C values for the NPSG. While CF is not traditionally considered in UF studies, our results indicate it can substantially influence the interpretation of UDOC (14)C "age", and thus reactivity, in the marine environment. In addition, our results indicate that CF can in fact be used as a proxy for average MW. We suggest that a variable-CF-UF approach, coupled with molecular-level Delta(14)C analyses, presents a new tool for studying relationships between molecular size, age, and "labile" DOC distributions in the ocean.

Both the raw MMT, DOM. and MMT complex (DOM-MMT) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photo-emission spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Batch adsorption studies were carried out on the adsorption of PHE as a function of contact time, temperature, and adsorbent dose. The sorption of PHE on complex was rapid, and the kinetics could be described well by the Pseudo-first-order model (R(2) > 0.99), with an equilibrium time of 120 min. The adsorption isotherm was in good agreement with the Henry equation and Freundlich equation. Also, thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous in nature. Compared with MMT, the adsorption capacity of DOM-MMT complex for PHE was greatly enhanced. The effects of DOM on PHE sorption by MMT may be attributed to the changes in the surface structure, the specific surface area, the hydrophobic property, and the average pore size of MMT. A series of atomistic simulations were performed to capture the structural and functional qualities observed experimentally. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Using fluorescence to characterize dissolved organic matter in Antarctic sea ice brines	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Sea ice plays a dynamic role in the air-sea exchange of CO2. In addition to abiotic inorganic carbon fluxes, an active microbial community produces and remineralizes organic carbon, which can accumulate in sea ice brines as dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, the characteristics of DOM fluorescence in Antarctic sea ice brines from the western Weddell Sea were investigated. Two humic-like components were identified, which were identical to those previously found to accumulate in the deep ocean and represent refractory material. Three amino-acid-like signals were found, one of which was unique to the brines and another that was spectrally very similar to tryptophan and found both in seawater and in brine samples. The tryptophan-like fluorescence in the brines exhibited intensities higher than could be explained by conservative behavior during the freezing of seawater. Its fluorescence was correlated with the accumulation of nitrogen-rich DOM to concentrations up to 900 mu mol L-1 as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and, thus, potentially represented proteins released by ice organisms. A second, nitrogen-poor DOM fraction also accumulated in the brines to concentrations up to 200 mu mol L-1 but was not correlated with any of the fluorescence signals identified. Because of the high C:N ratio and lack of fluorescence, this material is thought to represent extracellular polymeric substances, which consist primarily of polysaccharides. The clear grouping of the DOM pool into either proteinaceous or carbohydrate-dominated material indicates that the production and accumulation of these two subpools of DOM in sea ice brines is, to some extent, decoupled.

Systematic removal of neutral sugars within dissolved organic matter across ocean basins	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Dissolved combined neutral sugars (DCNS) support heterotrophic bacterioplankton metabolism throughout the ocean, which affects ocean carbon cycling and biogeochemistry. Variability in DCNS composition also provides information about the diagenetic state of oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM). Here, we present results of the DCNS composition in similar to 600 discrete samples from ocean basin-scale sections within the North Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans; and at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study site in the Sargasso Sea. As DCNS concentrations decline with water mass age the mole percentages of glucose, mannose + xylose, and galactose change in a ratio of +2.10:-1.10:-1.00 enriching the DOM pool in glucose relative to mannose + xylose, and galactose. A new proxy is presented based on the relative change in these major sugars, diagenetic distance, which allows for comparison of the diagenetic state of DOM over broad regions of the global ocean while simultaneously quantifying progress along this pathway. In all, this inter-basin comparison suggests that there is a common diagenetic pathway for oceanic DOM. Citation: Goldberg, S. J., C. A. Carlson, M. Brzezinski, N. B. Nelson, and D. A.

J	Guo, XY; Shao, HQ; Hu, WL; Shen, H				Guo, Xiaoyan; Shao, Huaiqi; Hu, Wanli; Shen, Hao			Fouling potential and cleaning characteristics of PVC ultrafiltration membrane during ultrafiltration of hydrophilic dissolved organic matter	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT					3rd International Desalination Workshop (IDW)	NOV 03-06, 2010	Jeju, SOUTH KOREA	Ctr Seawater Desalinat Plant, European Desalinat Soc				The hydrophilic fraction of dissolved organic matter was thought as the important foulant during drinking water treatment by membranes recently. Citric acid, polysucrose and oligopeptide were selected to represent the hydrophilic acid, neutral and base to investigate the fouling characteristics on a (modified polyvinylchloride) ultrafiltration membrane. Four kinds of cleaning methods, i.e., flushing, backwashing, flushing and backwashing and chemical cleaning with 0.5% NaOH were performed for the three hydrophilic dissolved organic matter fouled membranes to deal with the fouling mechanisms of the polyvinylchloride ultrafiltration membrane. Results showed that the citric acid may react with the membrane in pores to change the membrane properties so that the flux did not recover at all. The membrane fouling by polysucrose was mostly reversible due to the weak interaction between hydroxyl on polysucrose and carboxyl on membrane. The amino and carboxyl on the oligopeptide also reacted with the carboxyl on the membrane surface to form the stronger hydrogen bond to make the permeate flux partly recover after NaOH chemical cleaning. During ultrafiltration of the mixed hydrophilic dissolved organic matter solution composed of the three compounds, the membrane performances were always close to one of the three compounds, of which membrane flux was lowest.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				SEP	2011	33	1-3					231	239		10.5004/dwt.2011.2643						WOS:000297925500029

Comparison of tree species effects on microbial C and N transformations and dissolved organic matter properties in the organic layer of boreal forests	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												The aim of this study was to determine whether tree species consistently affects soil microbial activities related to C and N cycling and to compare these activities with the characteristics of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM). Samples were taken from the mor-type organic layer (Of+Oh) underlain by podzols of six 20-72-year-old tree-species experiments on different site types in different parts of Finland. Sampling plots were dominated by silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) or Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L, only on four sites). Amounts of C and N in the microbial biomass and rates of C mineralization (CO(2) production) and net N mineralization were determined, and water extracts were analysed for concentrations of DOC and DON and characterized according to molecular size by ultrafiltration and according to chemical composition using a resin fractionation technique. In all older stands, birch, compared to spruce or pine, increased soil pH. NH(4)-concentration and amounts of C and N in microbial biomass and decreased the C-to-N ratio and ratio of dissolved organic N (DON)-to-mineral N. Birch had similar effects also in part of the younger stands. Birch also increased the rates of both C and net N mineralization compared to spruce or pine but only on two sites. In all soils, net nitrification was low. The distribution of DOC into different fractions based on chemical composition and molecular size was rather similar in all soils. The most abundant chemical fraction was hydrophobic acids, and the most abundant molecular size fraction was 10-100 kDa. The C-to-N ratio varied but was lowest in hydrophilic bases and in the smallest molecular size class. Mineralization of C was highly and positively correlated with concentration of DOC (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.9, P < 0.01). The results indicated close interactions between microbial processes and dissolved organic matter. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sader, JA; Hattori, K; Hamilton, S; Brauneder, K				Sader, Jamil A.; Hattori, Keiko; Hamilton, Stewart; Brauneder, Kerstin			Metal binding to dissolved organic matter and adsorption to ferrihydrite in shallow peat groundwaters: Application to diamond exploration in the James Bay Lowlands, Canada	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The speciation and solubility of kimberlite pathfinder metals (Ni, Nd, Ba and K) in shallow peat groundwaters is investigated over the Yankee, Zulu and Golf kimberlites in the Attawapiskat region, James Bay Lowlands, Canada. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between dissolved organic matter (DOM) complexation with kimberlite pathfinder metals and determine the spatial distribution of those metals in shallow peat groundwaters along sampling transects over subcropping kimberlites. Nickel, Nd, Ba and K complexation with DOM and the adsorption of these metals onto ferrihydrite were calculated using Visual MINTEQ 3.0 and the NICA-Donnan database. Calculations predict almost 100% of soluble Nd, Ni and Ba form complexes with DOM at sampling sites with little to no contribution from upwelling groundwater (i.e., dissolved organic C (DOC) concentrations = 40-132 mg/L, pH = 3.9-5.5, and log ionic strength <=-3). In only the most ombrotrophic peat groundwater conditions does a majority fraction of K bind to DOM. By contrast, under conditions with large contributions from upwelling groundwaters (i.e., DOC concentrations <= 40 mg/L, pH = 5.5-6.5, and log ionic strength = -3 to -2), as little as 10% of Nd and Ni, and 0% K and Ba are predicted to complex with DOM. The modeling calculations suggest the dominant control on metal-DOM complexation, particularly with respect to Ni and Nd, is competitive effects for DOM binding sites due to elevated ionic strength where there is evidence of strong groundwater upwelling. Visual MINTEQ modeling of metal adsorption on ferrihydrite surfaces predicts that under strong upwelling conditions, Ni and Nd are scavenged from solution due to increased ferrihydrite precipitation and decreased fractions of metals complexed with DOM. Analytical geochemical data are consistent with model predictions of metal adsorption on ferrihydrite. Total dissolved Ni and Nd concentrations at sites of strong upwelling are up to five times lower than waters with little to no upwelling and log ferrihydrite saturation indices (logSl(ferr)) indicate precipitation (values up to 5) at sites of strong groundwater upwelling. Where the majority of Ni and Nd complex with DOM and ferrihydrite is highly under saturated (logSl(ferr) = -18 to -5), the concentrations of total Ni and Nd are elevated compared to other sites along sampling transects. Metal complexation with DOM effectively inhibits metal scavenging from solution via adsorption and/or from forming secondary mineral precipitates. Also, because alkaline earth metals do not compete strongly with Ni and Nd for adsorption sites on ferrihydrite surfaces, but do compete strongly for insoluble organic sites, Ni and Nd are more likely to adsorb onto ferrihydrite.

Prediction of DOM physical-chemical properties is achieved by studying its chemical structure and spatial conformation. In the present study, dissolved organic matter extracted from compost obtained from the organic fraction of urban wastes (DOM-P) has been analysed by FT-IR, CPMAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy and H-1 T-1 NMR relaxometry with fast field cycling (FFC) setup. While the first two spectroscopic techniques revealed the chemical changes of dissolved organic matter after adsorption either on kaolinite (DOM-K) or montmorillonite (DOM-S), the latter permitted the evaluation of the conformational variations as assessed by longitudinal relaxation time (T-1) distribution at the fixed magnetic field of 500 mT. Alterations of T-1 distributions from DOM-P to DOM-K and DOM-S were attributed to a decreasing molecular complexity following DOM-P adsorption on the clay minerals. This study applied for the first time solid state H-1 T-1 NMR relaxometry to dissolved organic matter from compost obtained from the organic fraction of urban wastes and revealed that this technique is very promising for studying environmentally relevant natural organic systems.

DOM in effluents from an artificial wastewater, a landfill leachate, a saline wastewater, and DOM collected from surface water were also tested for comparison. As for pilot WWTPs operating with the same actual wastewater feed, the DOM transformation was comparable: low MW (< 500 Da) and middle MW (> 5000 Da) organic materials decreased, while humic-like substances with MW of 650 Da, 1700 Da and 2000 Da and large MW organic materials (SMPs) with MW > 10,000 Da were aggregated. DOM in effluents from different sewage displayed their own characteristic SEC chromatograms. The properties of sewage effluent were influenced by the wastewater source, operation parameters and the inflow style of the biological treatment process. The only intensity difference in the SEC chromatogram was observed for effluents from WWTPs operating with the same actual wastewater feed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 182 proteins matched by 286 unique peptides were identified from three DOM samples. The number of proteins in the large DOM (LDOM; 0.2-0.7-mu m fraction) was significantly greater than that in the small DOM (SDOM; 5-kD-0.2-mu m fraction). There was no remarkable difference in the number of proteins between the surface and bathypelagic SDOMs. The sources of dissolved proteins were diverse in surface DOM, including various bacterial and phytoplankton groups as well as Oomycetes, whereas the Archaea, Proteobacteria, and some phytoplankton groups were the major contributors to bathypelagic DOM. Proteins involved in cytoskeleton, energy production and conversion, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones presented high abundance in surface LDOM, whereas proteins involved in translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis were more abundant in bathypelagic LDOM. Proteins involved in transport and metabolism, cell wall or membrane or envelope biogenesis, and photosynthesis were abundant in the 75-m LDOM. A urea ABC transporter assigned to amino acid transport and metabolism was the most abundant protein in the 10-m SDOM, whereas methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase involved in energy production and conversion dominated the protein profiles in the 75- and 3000-m SDOMs. The dissolved proteins in the water column are diverse and dynamic, with each layer characterized by unique proteins, and only a very minor amount of proteins from the surface are protected and transferred to the deep sea.

Samples taken from the Taiping Wastewater Treatment Plant (TWTP) (Harbin, China) and from the Songhuajing River (SR), Heilongjiang Province, China were chosen to represent waters containing DOM of wastewater origin and of natural-water origin, respectively. DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The SR fractions were more UV-sensitive and more reactive with chlorine in formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) than the TWTP secondary effluent (TSE) fractions. The aromatic character peaks in the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of SR fractions were clearer than those of TSE fractions. On the other hand, the peaks of carbohydrates in TSE fractions were more prominent in comparison with SR fractions. In addition, the amide-2 peak was present in the spectra of all the five TSE fractions but not visible in the spectra of SR fractions. The fluorescence results showed that SR DOM fractions contained more fulvic acid-like fluorescent compounds while TSE DOM fractions had higher amounts of protein-like fluorescent components.																	0167-6369					SEP	2011	180	1-4					371	383		10.1007/s10661-010-1793-9						WOS:000293410200026	21107903	
J	Sanchez-Marin, P; Beiras, R				Sanchez-Marin, Paula; Beiras, Ricardo			Adsorption of different types of dissolved organic matter to marine phytoplankton and implications for phytoplankton growth and Pb bioavailability	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to two species of marine phytoplankton (Isochrysis galbana and Thalassiosira weissflogii) was evaluated and quantified, and effects of DOM on the growth rate and Pb bioavailability were tested for I. galbana and compared with T. weissflogii. Isochrysis galbana growth rate was stimulated by different types of DOM. Humic acids (HA) had the highest stimulatory effect on cell growth followed by Suwannee river dissolved organic matter (SRDOM) and fulvic acids (FA). DOM also enhanced Pb adsorption and internalization by I. galbana, and the magnitude of these effects followed the same order: HA > SRDOM-FA, which was also the same order observed for the magnitude of DOM adsorption to surfaces. It is hypothesized that DOM adsorption on membrane surfaces may be a necessary step to cause both the increase in growth rate and the increase in Pb internalization by the algae, effects not observed in the case of the diatom T. weissflogii, an organism with an outer silica wall, thought to be the primary site of DOM adsorption. The different degree of effects caused by the different types of DOM may be explained according to their physicochemical properties.

Characterisation of dissolved organic matter in karst spring waters using intrinsic fluorescence: Relationship with infiltration processes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												From analysis of spectrophotometric properties of dissolved organic matter (OM) and the hydrochemical responses of some karst springs under different hydrologic conditions, an assessment of the origin and transfer pathway of OM present in karst spring waters, from soil and epikarst toward the spring, has been conducted for three karst aquifers in southern Spain: Alta Cadena, Sierra de Enmedio and Los Tajos. Intrinsic fluorescence (excitation-emission matrices or EEMs), together with major water chemistry (electrical conductivity, temperature, alkalinity, Cl(-), Mg(+2)) and P(CO2) along with natural hydrochemical tracers (TOC and NO(3)(-)), have been monitored in 19 springs which drain the three karst aquifers examined in this study. The spring water EEM spectra indicate that fulvic acid-like substances, produced in the soil as a consequence of the decomposition of OM, are the dominant fluorophores, although some of the OM appears to originate from in situ microbiological activity but could be indicative of contamination present in recharge waters from livestock. During each recharge event, TOC and NO(3)(-) concentrations increased and variations in fluorescence intensities of peaks attributed to fulvic acid-like compounds were observed. In areas with minimal soil development, spatial and temporal variations in the fluorescence intensity of fulvic acid-like substances and other fluorophores derived from microbiological activity, together with other hydrochemical parameters, provide insights into the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers and the infiltration velocity of water from soil and facilitate assessment of contamination vulnerability in these aquifers.

Spatial and interannual variability of dissolved organic matter in the Kolyma River, East Siberia, observed using satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Kolyma River basin in northeastern Siberia, the sixth largest river basin draining to the Arctic Ocean, contains vast reserves of carbon in Pleistocene-aged permafrost soils. Permafrost degradation, as a result of climate change, may cause shifts in riverine biogeochemistry as this old source of organic matter is exposed. Satellite remote sensing offers an opportunity to complement and extrapolate field sampling of dissolved organic matter in this expansive and remote region. We develop empirically based algorithms that estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Kolyma River and its major tributaries in the vicinity of Cherskiy, Russia. Field samples from July 2008 and 2009 were regressed against spectral data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus. A combination of Landsat band 3 and bands 2: 1 resulted in an R-2 of 0.78 between measured CDOM and satellite-derived predictions. Owing to the strong correlation between CDOM and DOC, the resulting maps of the region show strong interannual variability of both CDOM and DOC, and important spatial patterns such as mixing zones at river confluences and downstream loading of DOC. Such variability was previously unobserved through field-based point observations and suggests that current calculations of DOC flux from the Kolyma River to the Arctic Ocean may be underestimates. In this era of rapid climate change, permafrost degradation, and shifts in river discharge, remote sensing of CDOM and DOC offers a powerful, reliable tool to enhance our understanding of carbon cycling in major arctic river systems.																	2169-8953					AUG 10	2011	116								G03018	10.1029/2010JG001634						WOS:000293909500002

Physical (current direction and velocity), hydrological (salinity, suspended particulate matter (SPM) turbidity, total volume and mean size of suspended flocs), and chemical tracer (nutrients, chromophoric dissolved organic matter, and dissolved organic nitrogen) data were collected. Harmonic analysis that included diurnal, semidiurnal, and quarter-diurnal constituents was conducted on time series data for all of the parameters measured. Spectral analysis was performed to determine whether the three harmonics could characterize the variations observed in the data. The amplitude ratio of quarter-diurnal harmonic to the sum of diurnal and semidiurnal harmonics was expected to quantify the nonconservative extent of the chemical tracers. This ratio generally was higher in turbid seawater, whereas the lowest ratio occurred at a station where the seawater displayed zero turbidity throughout the experiment. The quarter-diurnal phase lags between SPM and chemical tracers were believed to provide information about how SPM and chemicals interact. How field processes such as resuspension and flocculation/disaggregation affected the kinetics of the chemical tracers also was explored by plotting the quarter-diurnal phase spectra along the 32 size classes obtained from Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissometry measurements.

Effect of estimations of ultraviolet absorption spectra of chromophoric dissolved organic matter on the uncertainty of photochemical production calculations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The UV-visible absorption spectrum of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is crucial for accurate calculation of photochemical reaction rates in the ocean. The literature contains considerable variability for quantifying CDOM absorption spectra, and it is unclear how these different approaches affect subsequent photochemical calculations. Using 128 surface ocean samples collected during coastal transects from Texas to Maine, we examine the ability of four simple models to reconstruct the measured UV absorption spectra and examine the accuracy of photochemical production calculations made using the reconstructed spectra. Three exponential models are based on determination of a spectral slope coefficient (SSC) over distinct wavelength ranges (412-560 nm, 290-412 nm, and 290-650 nm) and one is based on absorption at only 412 nm. Including UV wavelengths to determine SSC resulted in the reconstruction of UV absorption spectra with high accuracy, underestimating measured absorption integrated over the UV by only -1.5% to -4.3% at worst for the 128 samples. The 412 nm model estimated UV-integrated absorption ranged between -4.3% to + 6.5% of measured spectra for coastal stations. The 412-560 nm SSC model underestimated measured UV absorption at all wavelengths by up to 60%. A spectral correction factor based on the average percent underestimation for all samples was found to improve reconstruction of UV absorption and photochemical estimates. Without the correction factor, photoproduction from this model underestimates values calculated from measured UV spectra ranging from -13% to -20% for coastal stations. Corrected estimates improve this to between -1.4% and + 6.8%.																	0148-0227					AUG 2	2011	116								C08002	10.1029/2010JC006823						WOS:000293652100001		
J	Wang, TM; Wang, YY; Xiang, B; Hu, Y				Wang Tai-ming; Wang Ye-yao; Xiang Bao; Hu Yu			Effect Freezing and Thawing Cycles on Fluorescence Characterization of Black Soil Dissolved Organic Matter	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Fluorescence characterization of soil dissolved organic matter(DOM), which is one of the most important indexes concerning study on soil organic matter, can be effected by freezing and thawing cycles. In this paper, the fluorescence characterization of black soil DOM under the effect of freezing and thawing cycles was studied, using three-dimensional excitation-emission-matrix fluorescence spectroscopic(EEM). Based on the transformation of fluorescence characterization, the influences of humification degree and active humus in black soil were analysed. The result showed, compared with untreated by freezing and thawing cycles, (1) The phenomena red-shift of UV fulvic-like was found in soil DOM. It meant that the aromatization and humification degree increased. (2) Protein-like fluorescence peak was observed in some soil samples, which meant microbial activity was enhanced. (3) Active humus and humification degree are the indexs of soil fertility. The content of TOC in the active humus rose, just the same as the value of humification degree. It meant that soil fertility was improved. (4) Compared with the ratio of UV; visible humic-like fluorescence(r((a, c))), there were positive correlations with the active humus and humification degree. It meant that r((a, c)) of soil DOM was one of the indexs on active humus, humification degree and soil fertility effected by freezing and thawing cycles.																	1000-0593					AUG	2011	31	8					2136	2140		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2011)08-2136-05						WOS:000293681300029		
J	Tanaka, Y; Ogawa, H; Miyajima, T				Tanaka, Yasuaki; Ogawa, Hiroshi; Miyajima, Toshihiro			Production and bacterial decomposition of dissolved organic matter in a fringing coral reef	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON, respectively) were measured in Shiraho fringing reef (Japan), using a high-temperature catalytic-oxidation method. When the seawater on the reef flat (shallow lagoon) was isolated from the surrounding ocean due to the low tide, the concentrations of DOC and DON on the reef flat were 66-75 and 4.8-5.7 mu mol l(-1), respectively. The DOC and DON concentrations were higher than those of the adjacent outer ocean (57-58 and 3.8 mu mol l(-1), respectively), suggesting that the coral reef functioned as a net source of dissolved organic matter for the surrounding ocean. In order to investigate long-term bacterial decomposition of the reef-derived DOC (RF-DOC), the seawater samples collected on the reef flat and at the adjacent ocean were incubated in the dark for 1 year. Regression analysis using an exponential curve that considered two degradability pools (labile and refractory) fitted the mineralization of the RF-DOC very well (r (2) > 0.89). According to the regression analysis, the DOC produced on the reef flat was composed of the labile fraction of 63-94% (average 77%) and the refractory fraction of 6-37% (average 23%). It was concluded that some of the DOC that was produced in the coral reef ecosystem was exported to the surrounding ocean if the reef flat had a water residence time less than several months. The exported organic matter may support microbial communities in the ocean as an energy source.																	0916-8370					AUG	2011	67	4					427	437		10.1007/s10872-011-0046-z						WOS:000294181200009

Effect of organic matter source and salinity on dissolved organic matter isolation via ultrafiltration and solid phase extraction	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In this study, samples were taken from three contrasting freshwater sources and amended with salt in order to determine the influence of salinity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition on DOM recovery via ultrafiltration and solid phase extraction (SPE) with C(18) disks. Salt addition caused variable recovery of DOM when using C(18) SPE, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic characterization of the extracted material showed spectral responses that varied among sample sources. In contrast, increasing sample salinity from 0 to 30 ppt consistently caused a 15-25% reduction in the amount of high molecular weight DOM isolated by ultrafiltration for both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric DOM (CDOM), regardless of DOM composition. We hypothesize that a change in conformation (such as coiling or disaggregation) of DOM molecules occurs in the presence of salt, allowing them to pass through the ultrafiltration membrane and thereby decreasing the DOM retained by ultrafiltration. These results are important because they demonstrate that changes in salinity can influence DOM recovery in estuaries. Interpretation of DOM characteristics along estuarine gradients needs to account for potential artifacts introduced by sample isolation techniques.																	1015-1621					AUG	2011	73	3					405	417		10.1007/s00027-011-0189-4						WOS:000292970500008

In all stations, the remarkably high [D-Fe] and humic F intensity were found at depths between 25 and 200 m with the subsurface maxima of [D-Fe] (1.0-3.2 nM) and humic F intensity (4-5 quinine sulfate units) in the upper halocline layer (upper HL), being associated with a prominent nutrient maximum. The high [D-Fe] and humic F intensity within the upper HL are probably attributed to the Fe(III) complexation with natural organic ligands, such as marine dissolved humic substances, resulting from main processes of the brine rejection during sea ice formation and interactions with sediments on the shelves. However, subsurface maxima (10-50 nM) of [T-Fe] were found in the lower halocline layer, beneath the upper HL, of all slope and basin regions and are mainly attributed to the resuspension of sedimentary particles in the shelf region. The finding of subsurface iron maxima in the halocline water of all regions may be the first confirmation for the lateral iron transport into the halocline layer from the shelves to the Arctic Basin.

Dissolved organic matter dynamic in the Amazon basin: Sorption by mineral surfaces	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												In aquatic systems, soprtion of organic matter (OM) on environmental surfaces or its preference to remain dissolved is highly important for determining its potential transport and/or susceptibility to degradation. In the Amazon and other major rivers of the world, transported OM is either adsorbed to fine minerals or remains dissolved. The fate of autochthonous OM in Amazon floodplains and allochthonous OM from the river can be addressed by characterizing the nature of OM interactions with the sediment material. This goal was pursued in this study using Rio Negro and Amazon River samples as well as those collected from floodplain lakes during phytoplanktonic blooms, small black rivers, soil solution issued from podzolic areas in the Rio Negro watershed and "terra firme" stream flowing into the floodplain. The amount of carbon surface loading expressed as the adsorbed organic carbon per unit of surface area of the substrate was obtained by batch experiments with mineral phases representative of soils, suspended matter found in the Amazon basin and extracted OM fractions (the hydrophobic, HPO and the transphilic, TPH fractions of OM). The bulk dissolved organic matter samples were characterized by carbon and nitrogen isotopic measurements as well as elementary composition, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), molecular weight (Mw) and FTIR spectroscopy. To our knowledge, these are the first C and N isotopic composition data reported for extracted OM fractions in the Amazon basin. The Rio Negro basin water samples had high [DOC] correlated with conductivity. The SUVA values ranged from 4.0 to 7.3 m(-1)l mg(-1)C and were within the range of measurements reported for the Amazon River. The delta(13)C values of all HPO fractions varied from -27.7 to -30.2%.. The delta(13)C values for the TPH fractions were systematically 1%. higher than their respective HPO fraction. An increasing trend between the weight average Mw of the DOC as function of the C/N ratio (the higher C/N the higher Mw) is reported. This trend is inferred to result from both mixing between 2 end-members and OM fractionation. Carbon surface loadings calculated for HPO and TPH fractions ranged between 23 to 309 mu gC m(-2) and 38 to 145 mu gC m(-2), respectively. Carbon surface loadings with goethite and the Rio Negro organic matter fractions cluster around the average value of 24.5 +/- 4 mu gC m(-2). With the help of the pH dependant dissociation measurements and NICA-Donnan model parameters, it was possible to estimate the amount of deprotonated sites on the OM interacting with the sediment material. The amount of carbon surface loading was correlated with the calculated residual negative charge of the OM fractions (i.e. HPO or TPH). These analyses showed that higher residual negative charges were associated with lower carbon surface loadings on the treated sediment. The decrease of the negative charge was suggested to reduce the net electrostatic repulsion between the OM fractions and the clay surfaces and promote ligand exchange reactions governing sorption to clays. The preferential uptake of the high molecular weight fraction demonstrates that the chemical nature of the organic matter remaining in solution differs from that of the adsorbed fraction.

J	Tiwari, SP; Shanmugam, P				Tiwari, S. P.; Shanmugam, P.			An optical model for the remote sensing of coloured dissolved organic matter in coastal/ocean waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												An optical model is developed for the remote sensing of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a wide range of waters within coastal and open ocean environments. The absorption of CDOM (denoted as a(g)) is generally considered as an exponential form model, which has two important parameters - the slope S and absorption of CDOM at a reference wavelength a(g)(lambda(0)). The empirical relationships for deriving these two parameters are established using in-situ bio-optical datasets. These relationships use the spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) ratio at two wavelengths R-rs(670)/R-rs(490), which avoids the known atmospheric correction problems and is sensitive to CDOM absorption and chlorophyll in coastal/ocean waters. This ratio has tight relationships with a(g)(412) and a(g)(443) yielding correlation coefficients between 0.77 and 0.78. The new model, with the above parameterization applied to independent datasets (NOMAD SeaWiFS match-ups and Carder datasets), shows good retrievals of the a(g)(lambda) with regression slopes close to unity, little bias and low mean relative and root mean square errors. These statistical estimates improve significantly over other inversion models (e.g., Linear Matrix-LM and Garver-Siegel-Maritorena-GSM semi-analytical models) when applied to the same datasets. These results demonstrate a good performance of the proposed model in both coastal and open ocean waters, which has the potential to improve our knowledge of the biogeochemical cycles and processes in these domains.

Fluorescence: Absorption coefficient ratio - Tracing photochemical and microbial degradation processes affecting coloured dissolved organic matter in a coastal system	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The optical properties of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) - absorption coefficient, induced fluorescence, and fluorescence quantum yield - were determined in the coastal eutrophic system of the Ria de Vigo (NW Spain) under two contrasting situations: a downwelling event in September 2006 and an upwelling event in June 2007. Significantly different optical properties were recorded in the shelf surface (higher absorption coefficient and lower quantum yield) and bottom (lower absorption coefficient and higher quantum yield) waters that entered the embayment during downwelling and upwelling conditions, respectively. Continental waters presented distinctly high CDOM levels. The spatial and temporal variability of the induced fluorescence to absorption coefficient ratio during the mixing of shelf and continental waters was used to quantify the relative importance of photochemical and microbial processes under these contrasting hydrographic conditions. Photochemical processes were dominant during the downwelling episode: 86% of the variability of CDOM can be explained by photochemical degradation. On the contrary, microbial processes prevailed during the upwelling event: 77% of the total variability of CDOM was explained by microbial respiration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The MSTD process was operated under a sequencing batch mode, and the operating time of each cycle was 15 d from the initial fresh sludge to the final thickened and digested sludge. Results showed that the molecular weight (MW) distribution of DOM in sludge supernatant became broader after the MSTD process, and three main peaks including Peak A and Peak B related to protein-like substances and Peak C associated with humic acid-like substances could be identified from the EEM fluorescence spectra of all DOM samples in the MSTD process. The quantitative analysis of the fluorescence spectra of DOM in sludge supernatant showed that the fluorescence intensity (FI) of Peak A and Peak B in sludge supernatant correlated well with the concentration of soluble protein, MLSS destruction efficiency and mean particle size, suggesting that the variations of EEM fluorescence spectra of DOM in sludge supernatant could be used to evaluate the floc destruction mechanisms of the MSTD process. It was also found that the FI of Peak A slightly increased before 8 d but rapidly went up after 8 d, and the FI of Peak B changed slightly before 8 d but increased after 8 d, which implied that the floc destruction mechanisms were varied in one cycle of the MSTD process.

Suwannee river fulvic acid (SRFA), a type of DOM, could significantly increase the toxicity of CuO NPs to prokaryotic alga Microcystis aeruginosa. Internalization of CuO NPs was observed for the first time in the intact algal cells using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and the cell uptake was enhanced by SRFA. A fast Fourier transformation (FFT)/inversed FFT (IFFT) process revealed that a main form of intracellular NPs was Cu2O, and an intracellular environment may reduce CuO into Cu2O. The internalization behavior alone did not seem to pose a hazard to membrane integrity as shown from the flow cytometry data. Elevated CuO nanotoxicity by SRFA was related to a combination of a lesser degree of aggregation, higher Cu2+ release, and enhanced internalization of CuO NPs.

The acid base properties and the binding characteristics with respect to Pb ions (using the new electroanalytical technique AGNES, Absence of Gradients and Nernstian Equilibrium Stripping) have been studied and fitted to NICA (Non-Ideal Competitive Isotherm). We evaluated the binding potential of each DOM fraction in order to better predict the speciation of Pb and, later, its bioavailability in the river. The total binding capacity of the different fractions to Pb, as well as the total titratable charge, reaches its maximum value at the most hydrophilic fraction from the treated effluent. Specific properties of the distribution of the complexing sites within each DOM fraction have been exposed by plotting the conditional affinity spectrum (CAS). The addition of these distributions, weighted according to the respective abundance of each organic fraction, allows for a full description of the Pb binding properties of the whole DOM of a sampling site. Despite its weak aromaticity, the hydrophilic fraction from the wastewater treatment plant effluent exhibits a high lead binding affinity, so that at typical environmental pH and free Pb levels (0.1 mu g L(-1)), Pb is mainly bound to the most hydrophilic fraction of the treated effluent (49% of bound Pb at pH 7). This feature may greatly enhance the transport of Pb and highlights that Pb speciation should also consider other fractions apart from humic and/or fulvic acids when studying surface waters under high human pressure.

Coupling asymmetric flow-field flow fractionation and fluorescence parallel factor analysis reveals stratification of dissolved organic matter in a drinking water reservoir	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A												Using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and fluorescence parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), we showed physicochemical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Beaver Lake Reservoir (Lowell, AR) were stratified by depth. Sampling was performed at a drinking water intake structure from May to July 2010 at three depths (3-, 10-, and 18-m) below the water surface. AF4-fractograms showed that the CDOM had diffusion coefficient peak maximums between 3.5 and 2.8 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1), which corresponded to a molecular weight range of 680-1950 Da and a size of 1.6-2.5 nm. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of whole water samples and AF4-generated fractions were decomposed with a PARAFAC model into five principal components. For the whole water samples, the average total maximum fluorescence was highest for the 10-m depth samples and lowest (about 40% less) for 18-m depth samples. While humic-like fluorophores comprised the majority of the total fluorescence at each depth, a protein-like fluorophore was in the least abundance at the 10-m depth, indicating stratification of both total fluorescence and the type of fluorophores. The results present a powerful approach to investigate CDOM properties and can be extended to investigate CDOM reactivity, with particular applications in areas such as disinfection byproduct formation and control and evaluating changes in drinking water source quality driven by climate change.

Characterization of aquatic dissolved organic matter by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation coupled to UV-Visible diode array and excitation emission matrix fluorescence	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A												Flow field-flow fractionation (FIFFF) with on-line UV/Visible diode array detector (DAD) and excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence detector has been developed for the characterization of optical properties of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected in the Otonabee River (Ontario, Canada) and Athabasca River (Alberta, Canada). The molecular weight (MW) distribution of DOM was estimated using a series of organic macromolecules ranging from 479 to 66,000 Da. Both the number-average (M(n)) and weight-average (M(w)) molecular weights of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) determined using these macromolecular standards were comparable to those obtained using polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) standards, suggesting that organic macromolecules can be used to estimate MW of natural organic colloids. The MW of eight river DOM samples determined by this method was found to have an M(n) range of 0.8-1.1 kDa, which agrees with available literature estimates. The FIFF-FDAD-EEM system provided insight into the MW components of river DOM including the optical properties by on-line absorbance and fluorescence measurement. A red-shift in emission and excitation wavelength maxima associated with lower spectral slope ratios (S(R) = S(275-29):S(350-400)) was related to higher MW DOM. However, DOM of different origins at similar MW also showed significant difference in optical properties. A difference of 47 and 40 nm in excitation and emission peak C maxima was found. This supports the hypothesis that river DOM is not uniform in size and optical composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In order to identify the impact of disinfection with ClO(2) on treated water quality, secondary effluent pretreated by coagulation was disinfected by ClO(2), and the characteristic of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the biological toxicity of the water before and after disinfection were investigated. The results showed that ClO(2) could remove part of DOM and the removal rate of hydrophobic (HO) component by ClO(2) was higher than that of hydrophilic (HI) fraction, resulting in the ratio of HI/HO increased. ClO(2) could reduce the substitution degree of aromatic ring of DOM which could lead to the decrease of trihalomethane formation potential. After treated by ClO(2), amount of DOM in every molecular weight (MW) interval dropped, implying that micro-organisms regeneration potential decrease. Furthermore, ClO(2) could decrease the biological toxicity of urban wastewater. These findings may be useful in evaluating the feasibility of the ClO(2) disinfection of tertiary sewage treatment.																	1582-9596					JUL	2011	10	7					855	859								WOS:000294726500001

Multiple tracers demonstrate distinct sources of dissolved organic matter to lakes of the Mackenzie Delta, western Canadian Arctic	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lakes of the Mackenzie Delta occur across a gradient that contains three clear end members: those that remain connected to river-water channels throughout the summer; those that receive only brief inputs of river water during an annual spring flood but contain dense macrophyte stands; and those that experience significant permafrost thaw along their margins. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption and fluorescence, and stable isotopes of DOM, DOM precursor materials, and bacteria to elucidate the importance of river water, macrophytes, and thermokarst as DOM sources to Mackenzie Delta lakes. Despite standing stocks of macrophyte C that are sevenfold to 12-fold greater than those of total DOC, stable isotopes indicated that autochthonous sources contributed less than 15% to overall DOM in macrophyte-rich lakes. Instead, fluorescence and absorption indicated that the moderate summertime increase in DOC concentration in macrophyte-rich lakes was the result of infrequent flushing, while bacterial delta(13)C indicated rapid bacterial removal of autochthonous DOC from the water column. In thermokarst lakes, summertime increases in DOC concentration were substantial, and stable isotopes indicated that much of this increase came from C released as a result of thermokarst-related processes. Our results indicate that these distinct sources of DOM to neighboring arctic Delta lakes may drive between-lake differences in C cycling and energy flow. Rapidly assimilated macrophyte DOM should be an important contributor to microbial food webs in our study lakes. In contrast, the accumulation of thermokarst-origin DOM allows for a significant role in physico-chemistry but indicates a lesser contribution of this DOM to higher trophic levels.

Dust inputs and bacteria influence dissolved organic matter in clear alpine lakes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Remote lakes are usually unaffected by direct human influence, yet they receive inputs of atmospheric pollutants, dust, and other aerosols, both inorganic and organic. In remote, alpine lakes, these atmospheric inputs may influence the pool of dissolved organic matter, a critical constituent for the biogeochemical functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Here, to assess this influence, we evaluate factors related to aerosol deposition, climate, catchment properties, and microbial constituents in a global dataset of 86 alpine and polar lakes. We show significant latitudinal trends in dissolved organic matter quantity and quality, and uncover new evidence that this geographic pattern is influenced by dust deposition, flux of incident ultraviolet radiation, and bacterial processing. Our results suggest that changes in land use and climate that result in increasing dust flux, ultraviolet radiation, and air temperature may act to shift the optical quality of dissolved organic matter in clear, alpine lakes.

J	Pisani, O; Yamashita, Y; Jaffe, R				Pisani, Oliva; Yamashita, Youhei; Jaffe, Rudolf			Photo-dissolution of flocculent, detrital material in aquatic environments: Contributions to the dissolved organic matter pool	WATER RESEARCH												This study shows that light exposure of flocculent material (floc) from the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) results in significant dissolved organic matter (DOM) generation through photo-dissolution processes. Floc was collected at two sites along the Shark River Slough (SRS) and irradiated with artificial sunlight. The DOM generated was characterized using elemental analysis and excitation emission matrix fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis. To investigate the seasonal variations of DOM photo-generation from floc, this experiment was performed in typical dry (April) and wet (October) seasons for the FCE. Our results show that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for samples incubated under dark conditions displayed a relatively small increase, suggesting that microbial processes and/or leaching might be minor processes in comparison to photo-dissolution for the generation of DOM from floc. On the other hand, DOC increased substantially (as much as 259 mgC gC(-1)) for samples exposed to artificial sunlight, indicating the release of DOM through photo-induced alterations of floc. The fluorescence intensity of both humic-like and protein-like components also increased with light exposure. Terrestrial humic-like components were found to be the main contributors (up to 70%) to the chromophoric DOM (CDOM) pool, while protein-like components comprised a relatively small percentage (up to 16%) of the total CDOM. Simultaneously to the generation of DOC, both total dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus also increased substantially during the photo-incubation period. Thus, the photo-dissolution of floc can be an important source of DOM to the FCE environment, with the potential to influence nutrient dynamics in this system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Persistence of two neonicotinoid insecticides in wastewater, and in aqueous solutions of surfactants and dissolved organic matter	CHEMOSPHERE												Wastewater treatment plants receive organic contaminants, such as pesticides, which reach the sewage system from domestic, industrial or agricultural activities. In wastewater, which is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, biotic or abiotic degradation of contaminants can be affected by the presence of co-solutes. The photodecomposition in natural sunlight of two neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, was investigated in wastewater, aqueous extracts of sewage sludge and in aqueous surfactant solutions, which are abundant in wastewater. Dissipation in the dark was also studied in wastewater, due to reduction of transmitted sunlight in wastewater ponds. With regard to photolysis, thiamethoxam degraded rapidly in all the aqueous solutions. Among them sewage sludge extracts slightly modified (average half-life 17.6 h), wastewater increased (13.7 h) and non-ionic surfactants led, as a family, to the highest dissipation rates (average 6.2 h), with respect to control water (18.7 h). Additionally this pesticide also underwent a slower biodegradation process in wastewater in the dark under anaerobic conditions (around 25 d). A metabolite of thiamethoxam from the biological decomposition in wastewater was identified by HPLC/MS. On the other hand thiacloprid was found to be resistant to photo- and biodecomposition and remained almost unchanged during the experimental periods in all the tested media. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbohydrate and dissolved organic carbon were also analyzed. The relationship between organic matter and red tide succession was examined. The results show that after the diatom bloom, tyrosine-like fluorescence B intensity was very high within the water column and exhibited a negative correlation with chlorophyll a over the period of the Synechococcus bloom. Other organic matter did not exhibit this relationship with chlorophyll a. This implied that diatom bloom dispersion resulted in the release of large quantities of tyrosine-like compounds into the water. These may play a role as a nutrient source or growth-stimulating substance for the subsequent Synechococcus bloom.																	0254-4059					JUL	2011	29	4					795	799		10.1007/s00343-011-0508-6						WOS:000292558700008

Dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in Mandovi and Zuari estuaries - A study through in situ and satellite data	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												The spatial and temporal distribution of absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter at 440 nm (a(CDOM) (440)) in the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries situated along the west coast of India, has been analysed. The study was carried out using remotely sensed data, obtained from the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) on board the Indian Remote Sensing satellite - P4, together with in situ data during the period January to December 2005. Satellite retrieval of CDOM absorption was carried out by applying an algorithm developed for the site. A good correlation (R = 0.98) was obtained between satellite derived CDOM and in situ data. Time series analysis revealed that spatial distribution of CDOM has a direct link with the seasonal hydrodynamics of the estuaries. The effect of remnant fresh water on CDOM distribution could be analysed by delineating a plume in the offshore region of the Zuari estuary. Though fresh water flux from terrestrial input plays a major role in the distribution of CDOM throughout the Mandovi estuary, its role in the Zuari estuary is significant up to the middle zone. Other processes responsible for feeding CDOM in both the estuaries are coastal advection, in situ production and resuspension of bottom settled sediments. The highest value of a(CDOM)(440) was observed in the middle zone of the Mandovi estuary during the post-monsoon season. The relation between a(CDOM)(440) and S (spectral slope coefficient of CDOM) could differentiate CDOM introduced in to estuaries through multiple sources. The algorithm developed for the Mandovi estuary is S = 0.003 [a(CDOM) (440)(-0.7091)] while for the Zuari estuary, S = 0.0031 [a(CDOM) (440)(-.0777)]. respectively.

J	Shank, GC; Evans, A				Shank, G. Christopher; Evans, Anne			Distribution and photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in northern Gulf of Mexico shelf waters	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The distribution and photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the northern Gulf of Mexico along the Louisiana coastal shelf were examined during three cruises in summer 2007, fall 2007, and summer 2008. The influence of the Mississippi River plume was clearly evident as CDOM levels (defined as a(305)) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were well-correlated with salinity during all cruises. Elevated CDOM and CDOM:DOC ratios of surface samples collected offshore of Atchafalaya Bay and the Breton-Chandeleur Sound complex indicated emanations of organic-rich waters from coastal wetlands are also an important source to nearshore shelf waters. Generally, CDOM and DOC levels were highest in surface waters and decreased with depth, but during summer 2007 and summer 2008, CDOM levels in near-bottom samples were occasionally higher than at mid-depths without concomitant increases in DOC. CDOM photobleaching was measured during 24 irradiations using a SunTest XLS+ solar simulator with photobleaching rate coefficients (k(305)) ranging from 0.011 to 0.32 h(-1). For fall 2007 and summer 2008, higher k(305) values were generally observed in samples with higher initial CDOM levels. However, samples collected during summer 2007 did not exhibit a similar pattern nor were there differences in photobleaching rates between surface and bottom samples. Spectral slope coefficients (S275-295 or S350-400) and DOC levels were largely unchanged after 24 h irradiations. Modeled CDOM photobleaching for northern Gulf of Mexico mid-shelf waters predicts that during the summer when solar irradiance is high and the water column becomes stratified, nearly 90% of the CDOM in the upper 1 m may be lost to photobleaching, with losses up to 20% possible even at 10 m depth.

Influence of 17 beta-estradiol binding by dissolved organic matter isolated from wastewater effluent on estrogenic activity	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The aims of this study were to determine the sorption coefficient (Log K(DOC)) of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), according to the size and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from wastewater effluent using a fluorescence quenching (FQ) method, and to measure the estrogenic changes due to the extent of E2 sorption onto effluent DOM (EfOM) by using an E-screen bioassay. The highest log K(DOC) of E2 for a DOM size fraction less than 0.2 mu m was observed by 4.87 +/- 1.87 L kg(DOC)(-1), and its estrogenicity was the lowest among all the size fractions at 1.2 ng-EEQ L(-1). However, E2 estrogenicity for a DOM size fraction less than 5 kDa was as high as that for the positive control due to the absence of fulvic acid- and protein-like DOM to bind with E2. The estrogenic activity for the hydrophobic fraction bound with E2 was significantly reduced to 1.6 ng-EEQL1, while that for the hydrophilic fraction having no binding with E2 was 2.6 ng-EEQ L(-1), which was similar to that of the positive control (i.e., 2.8 ng-EEQ L(-1)). The results support a conclusion that the change in estrogenicity was due to the strong sorption affinity of E2 onto DOM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

HS exert a variety of direct and indirect biological effects, including interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR is a cytosolic receptor that binds various hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) and mediates some of their toxic effects. In vitro effects of binary mixtures of various DOM (mainly HS) with various HOCs on AhR-mediated responses were studied by use of H4IIE-luc cells. Six out of 12 DOM activated the AhR even at environmentally relevant concentrations (17 mg L(-1)). In simultaneous exposures of H4IIE-luc cells to DOM (17 mg L(-1)) and each of the model compounds, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, PCB126, PCB169, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, fluoranthene, a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and a mixture of all HOCs, either significant additive or facilitative effects were observed when compared to activities of single HOCs. No significant decrease of effects due to possible sorption of HOCs to DOM was observed, even in subsequent experiments when HOCs + DOM mixtures were preincubated for six days before exposure to H4IIE-luc. Thus, DOM does not seem to protect organisms against AhR-mediated toxic effects of HOCs (as usually predicted due to sorption of HOCs on DOM), but it can actually enhance their potency for AhR-mediated effects in some situations.

Scott			Character and Chlorine Reactivity of Dissolved Organic Matter from a Mountain Pine Beetle Impacted Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Lodgepole pine needle leachates from trees killed by the mountain pine beetle epidemic in Colorado were evaluated for dissolved organic matter (DOM) character, biodegradation, treatability by coagulation and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. An average of 8.0 (+/- 0.62) mg-DOC/g-dry weight of litter was leached from three sets of needle samples representing different levels of forest floor degradation. Fluorescence analysis included collection of excitation and emission matrices, examination of peak intensities and development of a 4-component parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis model. Peak intensity and PARAFAC analyses provided complementary results showing that fresh leachates were initially dominated by polyphenolic/protein-like components (60-70%) and humic-like fluorescence increased (40-70%) after biodegradation. Humic-like components were removed by coagulation (20-64%), while polyphenolic/protein-like components were not, which may create challenges for utilities required to meet OM removal regulations. DBP formation yields after 24 h chlorination were 20.5-26.4 mu g/mg-DOC for trihalomethanes and 9.0-14.5 mu g/mg-DOC for haloacetic acids for fresh leachates; increased after biodegradation to 19.2-64.2 and 7.1-30.9 mu g/mg-DOC, respectively; and decreased after coagulation (fresh: 11.3-17.7;5.7-7.6 mu g/mg-DOC, respectively; biodegraded: 12.0-27.3 and 2.9-7.2 mu g/mg-DOC, respectively), reflective of changes in concentration of humic material. Humic-like PARAFAC components and peak intensities were positively correlated (R(2) >= 0.45) to DBP concentrations, while polyphenolic/protein-like components were not (R(2) <= 0.17).																	0013-936X					JUL 1	2011	45	13					5717	5724		10.1021/es1042436						WOS:000292075100038	21630676

The river system covers a northern area of the main island of Japan, and between 6 and 45% the watershed area of the tributaries is paddy fields. Water samples were collected monthly from eight tributaries for 1 yr, and the fluorescence properties of DOM were monitored by combined excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and parallel factor analysis. The EEM was statistically decomposed into six fluorescence components with different environmental dynamics. The relative proportion of these components varied with season and geographic location, the former having a greater effect than the latter. Seasonal variation is largely attributed to changes in the source of DOM associated with irrigated rice cultivation practice. The fluorescence component composition showed a stronger autochthonous signature, which varied over a wider range during off-cropping period (October-April) than cropping period (May-September). During the cropping period, a large amount of allochthonous DOM with relatively similar quality was transported into river water from flooded paddy fields and masked the variability in the quality of DOM among tributaries. Therefore, irrigated rice cropping practices are considered to be one of major factors that influence seasonal and geographical variation of fluvial DOM composition.																	0047-2425					JUL	2011	40	4					1266	1272		10.2134/jeq2010.0374						WOS:000292084100024	21712596

Influence of subsurface drainage on quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter export from agricultural landscapes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Despite its importance for aquatic ecosystem function and watershed carbon budgets, little is known about how land use influences dissolved organic matter (DOM) export. We investigated the influence of subsurface soil drainage, widespread in the Midwestern United States, on DOM export from agricultural fields designed to drain water at either 13 mm d(-1) (conventional) or 51 mm d(-1) (intense). Intense drainage exported 55% (+/-22%) more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) per year than conventional drainage due to both increased concentration and water yield. DOC export from plots was strongly dependent on precipitation and showed considerable interannual variability. Mean DOC concentrations in drainage water were low (1.62 and 1.87 mg L(-1) for conventional and intense treatments), and fluorescence index (FI) measurements showed that it had a microbial source with little evidence of terrestrially derived material, suggesting that flow through deeper, organic-poor soil horizons is important in regulating DOC export from these plots. We compared DOM in subsurface drains with downstream ditch and stream sites. Increases in DOC concentration and molecular weight accompanied by decreasing FI values at downstream sites showed that streams gain a large amount of terrestrially derived DOM during base flow transport through agricultural landscapes, probably from riparian zones. These results show that DOM compositional characteristics change with catchment area and that the relevant observation scale for DOM dynamics is likely to vary among watersheds. This study also demonstrates that land management practices can directly affect DOC via changes to water flow paths. These results are critical for improving model estimates of DOM export from agricultural landscapes as well as predicting how DOC export will respond to changing land use and climate.

The composition and transformation of the DOM and its fractions were investigated. The results show that the DOM isolated from young, intermediate, and old landfill leachates were mainly composed of tyrosine-, tryptophan-, and humic- and fulvic-like substances, respectively. The primary fractions of the DOM in leachates were HOA and HIM. The HOA and Him fractions from young leachates predominantly contained tryptophan- and tyrosine-like materials, respectively. The HOA fractions in intermediate and old leachates were mainly composed of humic- and fulvic-like materials, whereas the HIM fractions were dominated by tryptophan-like materials and humic- and fulvic-like substances. The hydrophobic organic fractions and humic- and fulvic-like substances increased with time, whereas the HIM and the tyrosine-like materials decreased during the landfill process, rendering biological processing of leachates ineffective.

Soil amendments (e.g. organic compounds or dissolved organic matter) may affect environmental behavior and bioavailability of pesticides. However, whether the physiochemical process of isoproturon in soils is affected by organic amendments and how it is affected in different soil types are unknown. To evaluate the impact of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on sorption/desorption and mobility of isoproturon in soils, comprehensive analyses were performed using two distinct soil types (Eutric gleysols and Hap udic cambisols). Our analysis revealed that adsorption of isoproturon in Eutric gleysols was depressed, and desorption and mobility of isoproturon were promoted in the presence of DOM and LMWOA. However, the opposite result was observed with Hap udic cambisols, suggesting that the soil type affected predominantly the physiochemical process. We also characterized differential components of the soils using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (Fr-IR) spectroscopy and show that the two soils displayed different intensity of absorption bands for several functional groups.

J	Shanmugam, P				Shanmugam, Palanisamy			New models for retrieving and partitioning the colored dissolved organic matter in the global ocean: Implications for remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Despite the importance of CDOM to upper ocean biogeochemical processes and optics, our current understanding of its spatial and temporal distributions and the factors controlling these distributions is very limited. This eventually prevents an understanding of its relationship to the pool of dissolved organic carbon in coastal and open oceans. This work aims to present a new approach for accurate modeling of absorption spectra of CDOM (a(cdom)) and deriving information on its composition in global ocean waters. The modeling approach uses measurements (in situ) of the remote sensing reflectances at two wavelengths (denoted R-555(443)rs) to estimate a(cdom)(350) and a(cdom)(412), applies them to determine two spectral slopes of an exponential curve fit (S) and a hyperbolic curve fit (gamma), derives an appropriate parameter (gamma degrees) for grading the CDOM compositional changes from a(cdom) (350) and gamma, and finally employs a(cdom) (350), S. and gamma degrees in a modified exponential model to describe a(cdom)(lambda) as a function of wavelength. The robustness of this model was rigorously tested on three independent datasets, such as NOMAD in situ data, NOMAD SeaWiFS match-ups data and IOCCG simulated data (all of them contain a(cdom)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda)). which represent a variety of waters within coastal and offshore regions around the world. Accuracy of the retrievals found with the new models was generally excellent, with MRE (mean relative error) and RMSE (root mean square error) of -5.64-3.55% and 0.203-0.318 for the NOMAD in situ datasets, and -5.63 to -0.98% and 0.136-0.241 for the NOMAD satellite datasets respectively (for lambda(412) to lambda(670)). When used with SeaWiFS images collected over the regional and global waters, the new model showed the highest surface abundances of CDOM within the subpolar gyres and continental shelves dominated by terrestrial inputs (and perhaps local production) of colored dissolved materials, and the lowest surface abundances of CDOM in the central subtropical gyres and the open oceans presumably regulated by photobleaching phenomenon, bacterial activity and local processes. Significant interseasonal and interannual seasonal changes in the terrestrially-derived CDOM distributions were noticed from these new products that closely corresponded with the global mean runoff/river discharge induced by climate change/warming scenarios.

Hydrologic control of dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry in pools of a subtropical dryland river	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Dryland rivers function as strongly linked ecologic-hydrologic systems, including both extended periods of drought and episodic flooding events. However, few studies have combined hydrologic and biogeochemical measurements to better understand the ecology of pools within dryland rivers. We used delta(2)H and delta(18)O values of pool water, rainfall, and groundwater combined with pool water measurements of C, N, and P and dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence characteristics to determine (1) the concentration and chemical composition of DOM and (2) the origin of surface water in 16 pools of a dryland river in northern Western Australia. Parallel factor analysis of excitation-emission matrices showed that humic-like components derived mainly from terrestrial plant material dominated total DOM fluorescence for all pools. Evaporation models using delta(2)H and delta(18)O showed a variety of pool hydrologic regimes, including pools with moderate to high evaporative water loss that were largely isolated from shallow alluvium water inputs and pools with consistent alluvium water throughflow and low evaporation. Concentrations of C, N, and P as well as total DOM fluorescence were generally greater in pools with high evaporative loss and lower in pools with alluvium water inputs. Pool delta(2)H and d18O values were also significantly correlated with DOM fluorescence characteristics and C, N, and P concentrations, providing quantitative evidence of the hydrologic influence on DOM biogeochemistry. Taken together, our findings suggest that individual pools function as distinct ecosystems within the riverine environment.

J	Hur, J; Lee, BM				Hur, Jin; Lee, Bo-Mi			Characterization of binding site heterogeneity for copper within dissolved organic matter fractions using two-dimensional correlation fluorescence spectroscopy	CHEMOSPHERE												The heterogeneity of copper binding characteristics for dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions was investigated based on the fluorescence quenching of the synchronous fluorescence spectra upon the addition of copper and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS). Hydrophobic acid (HoA) and hydrophilic (Hi) fractions of two different DOM (algal and leaf litter DOM) were used for this study. For both DOM, fluorescence quenching occurred at a wider range of wavelengths for the HoA fractions compared to the Hi fractions. The combined information of the synchronous and asynchronous maps derived from 2D-COS provided a clear picture of the heterogeneous distribution of the copper binding sites within each DOM fraction, which was not readily recognized by a simple comparison of the changes in the synchronous fluorescence spectra upon the addition of copper. For the algal DOM, higher stability constants were exhibited for the HoA versus the Hi fractions. The logarithms of the stability constants ranged from 4.8 to 6.1 and from 4.5 to 5.0 for the HoA and the Hi fractions of the algal DOM, respectively, depending on the associated wavelength and the fitted models. In contrast, no distinctive difference in the binding characteristics was found between the two fractions of the leaf litter DOM. This suggests that influences of the structural and chemical properties of DOM on copper binding may differ for DOM from different sources. The relative difference of the calculated stability constants within the DOM fractions were consistent with the sequential orders interpreted from the asynchronous 2D-COS. It is expected that 2D-COS will be widely applied to other DOM studies requiring detailed information on the heterogeneous nature and subsequent effects under a range of environmental conditions.

Detection and Structural Identification of Dissolved Organic Matter in Antarctic Glacial Ice at Natural Abundance by SPR-W5-WATERGATE H-1 NMR Spectroscopy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and is derived from various inputs that control its turnover. Glaciers and ice sheets are the second largest water reservoir in the global hydrologic cycle, but little is known about glacial DOM composition or contributions to biogeochemical cycling. Here we employ SPR-W5-WATERGATE H-1 NMR spectroscopy to elucidate and quantify the chemical structures of DOM constituents in Antarctic glacial ice as they exist in their natural state (average DOC of 8 mg/L) without isolation or preconcentration. This Antarctic glacial DOM is predominantly composed of a mixture of small recognizable molecules differing from DOM in marine, lacustrine, and other terrestrial environments. The major constituents detected in three distinct types of glacial ice include lactic and formic acid, free amino acids, and a mixture of simple sugars and amino sugars with concentrations that vary between ice types. The detection of free amino acid and amino sugar monomer components of peptidoglycan within the ice suggests that Antarctic glacial DOM likely originates from in situ microbial activity. As these constituents are normally considered to be biologically labile (fast cycling) in nonglacial environments, accelerated glacier melt and runoff may result in a flux of nutrients into adjacent ecosystems.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 1	2011	45	11					4710	4717		10.1021/es200697c						WOS:000291128700010	21542577

This was done by a small-scale acidification experiment during two years where 0.5 x 0.5 m(2) plots were artificially irrigated with water with different sulfuric acid content, and soil water was sampled using zero-tension lysimeters under the O-horizon. The DOM was characterized using absorbance, fluorescence, and size exclusion chromatography analyses. Our results showed lower mobility of DOM in the high acid treatment. At the same time, there was a significant change in the DOM quality. Soil water in the high acid treatment exhibited DOM that was less calored, less hydrophobic, less aromatic, and of lower molecular weight, compared to the low add treatment. This supports the hypothesis that reduction in sulfur deposition is an important driver behind the ongoing brownification of surface waters in many regions.

The spatial-seasonal dynamics of CDOM absorption and three CDOM composition variables, including spectral slope (S), spectral slope ratio (S(R)) and the M value, defined as the ratio of absorption at 250 nm/365 nm, were analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, river input processes and degradation of phytoplankton were studied to assess their impact on CDOM composition and the factors involved in the spatial-seasonal variability of CDOM. The CDOM absorption coefficient at a wavelength of 350 nm, a(350), ranged from 1.37-9.55 m(-1) with a mean of 3.33 +/- 1.32 m(-1). Spatially, higher a(350) values, but lower spectral slope, spectral slope ratio and M values, were recorded in the northern algae dominated bays while lower values were recorded in southeastern macrophyte dominated bays. The a(350) was significantly higher in inshore waters than in offshore waters. Values of S, S(R) and M decreased during the flood and algal bloom season in spring and summer whereas a(350) increased. In the three river profiles, the gradual decrease of a(350) along the trajectory from the river mouth into the lake during the flood season showed the contribution of allochthonous CDOM. A laboratory phytoplankton degradation experiment was conducted to determine the contribution of CDOM production from phytoplankton. The significant increase of a(350) with time in the CDOM production experiment underlines the importance of autochthonous CDOM production during the algal bloom season. In summary, the significant increase of a(350) in spring and summer (algal bloom season) may be due to both the allochthonous CDOM input from the surrounding rivers and the autochthonous production of CDOM from degrading phytoplankton.

Composition of dissolved organic matter in groundwater	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Groundwater constitutes a globally important source of freshwater for drinking water and other agricultural and industrial purposes, and is a prominent source of freshwater flowing into the coastal ocean. Therefore, understanding the chemical components of groundwater is relevant to both coastal and inland communities. We used electrospray ionization coupled with Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) to examine dissolved organic compounds in groundwater prior to and after passage through a sediment-filled column containing microorganisms. The data revealed that an unexpectedly high proportion of organic compounds contained nitrogen and sulfur, possibly due to transport of surface waters from septic systems and rain events. We matched 292 chemical features, based on measured mass: charge (m/z) values, to compounds stored in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). A subset of these compounds (88) had only one structural isomer in KEGG, thus supporting tentative identification. Most identified elemental formulas were linked with metabolic pathways that produce polyketides or with secondary metabolites produced by plants. The presence of polyketides in groundwater is notable because of their anti-bacterial and anti-cancer properties. However, their relative abundance must be quantified with appropriate analyses to assess any implications for public health. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Markager, S; Stedmon, CA; Sondergaard, M				Markager, Stiig; Stedmon, Colin A.; Sondergaard, Morten			Seasonal dynamics and conservative mixing of dissolved organic matter in the temperate eutrophic estuary Horsens Fjord	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study presents the results of a year-long study investigating the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Danish estuary, Horsens Fjord. The estuary is shallow with a mean depth of 2.9 m and receives high loadings of inorganic nutrients from its catchment. The behaviour of different DOM parameters i.e. dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorous (DOP), light absorption and eight fluorescence components, were analysed relative to conservative mixing. Many of the parameters did not behave conservatively. For DON, DOP and absorption, more than 65% of the freshwater concentration was removed initially at salinities below 12. At higher salinities two general patterns were identified. Concentrations of DON, DOP and four humic fluorescent fractions were not, or only weakly, related to salinity, showing that other processes than mixing were involved. Other parameters such as DOC and two terrestrial humic components behaved conservatively. The same was true for DON during winter. These results are consistent with the finding that autochthonous DOM was the dominant source of DOM in this estuary. The molar C:N and C:P ratios for DOM (DOC:DON and DOC:DOP) in freshwater were 11 and 758, respectively. The DOC:DON ratio increased in the estuary during the productive season to average values between 13 and 17, due to accumulation of DOC and removal of DON. The DOC:DOP ratio decreased within the estuary showing that in general DOM was enriched with phosphorous, however, during the spring, when phosphorous was limiting, the DOC:DOP ratio increased due to low DOP concentrations. We hypothesise that in estuaries with high loadings of inorganic nutrients relative to DOM, production and degradation of DOM within the estuary will dominate over allochthonous inputs and control both concentration and characteristics of DOM. A conceptual model for this hypothesis is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Antarctic sea ice	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												An investigation of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and its relationships to physical and biogeochemical parameters in Antarctic sea ice and oceanic water have indicated that ice melt may both alter the spectral characteristics of CDOM in Antarctic surface waters and serve as a likely source of fresh autochthonous CDOM and labile DOC. Samples were collected from melted bulk sea ice, sea ice brines, surface gap layer waters, and seawater during three expeditions: one during the spring to summer and two during the winter to spring transition period. Variability in both physical (temperature and salinity) and biogeochemical parameters (dissolved and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, as well as chlorophyll a) was observed during and between studies, but CDOM absorption coefficients measured at 375 nm (a(375)) did not differ significantly. Distinct peaked absorption spectra were consistently observed for bulk ice, brine, and gap water, but were absent in the seawater samples. Correlation with the measured physical and biogeochemical parameters could not resolve the source of these peaks, but the shoulders and peaks observed between 260 and 280 nm and between 320 to 330 nm respectively, particularly in the samples taken from high light-exposed gap layer environment, suggest a possible link to aromatic and mycosporine-like amino acids. Sea ice CDOM susceptibility to photo-bleaching was demonstrated in an in situ 120 hour exposure, during which we observed a loss in CDOM absorption of 53% at 280 nm, 58% at 330 nm, and 30% at 375 nm. No overall coincidental loss of DOC or DON was measured during the experimental period. A relationship between the spectral slope (S) and carbon-specific absorption (a*(375)) indicated that the characteristics of CDOM can be described by the mixing of two broad end-members; and aged material, present in brine and seawater samples characterised by highs values and low a*(375); and a fresh material, due to elevated in situ production, present in the bulk ice samples characterised by low S and high a*(375). The DOC data reported here have been used to estimate that approximately 8 Tg C yr(-1) (similar to 11% of annual sea ice algae primary production) may be exported to the surface ocean during seasonal sea ice melt in the form of DOC.

The photodegradation of El has been investigated in the absence and in the presence of 7.7-8.9 mg L(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), under solar light simulation with irradiance approximating that of the sun. DOC extracts from different origins have been used. Half-lives ranging between 3.9 h and 7.9 h were observed. Results indicated that E1 was photodegraded even in the absence of DOC. The presence of DOC was found to enhance the degradation of E1. Experiments performed with the addition of reactive species scavengers (azide ions and 2-propanol) have shown that these two species play a significant role in the photodegradation. Some experiments have been performed with a DOC previously submitted to solar irradiation. Changes in optical and physico-chemical properties of DOC strongly affect its photoinductive properties, and hence its efficiency on E1 degradation. A part of the study consisted in the investigation of photoproducts structures. Five photoproducts were shown by chromatographic analysis: one arising from direct photolysis and the four others from DOC photoinduced degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

HILIC-NMR: Toward the Identification of Individual Molecular Components in Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This article presents research targeted toward the isolation and detection of unique molecular structures from what is believed to be the world's most complex organic mixture: dissolved organic matter (DOM). Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) was used to separate Suwannee River DOM (SRDOM) into 80 fractions, simplified to the extent that detection with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) results in many sharp signals that are indicative of individual compounds, some of which are identifiable with multidimensional NMR. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) was additionally employed on HILIC-simplified fractions to further confirm the effectiveness of the HILIC separations as well as draw insight into how structural characteristics relate to DOM fluorescence signals. Findings suggest that material believed to be derived from both cyclic and linear terpenoids was dominant in the most hydrophobic fractions as were the majority of the fluorescence signals, whereas hydrophilic material was highly correlated with carbohydrate-type structures as well as high contributions from amino acid fluorescence. NMR spectra of DOM, typically featureless mounds, are substantially more detailed with HILIC-simplified fractions to the point where hundreds of signals are present and 2D NMR correlations permit significant structural identifications.																	0013-936X					MAY 1	2011	45	9					3880	3886		10.1021/es103425s						WOS:000289819400014	21469703

We targeted carbamazepine (CBZ) as a model compound to study the tertiary interactions between relatively polar PCs, DOM, and soil. Sorption-desorption behavior of CBZ was studied with bulk clay soil and the corresponding clay size fraction in the following systems: (i) without DOM, (ii) co-introduced with DOM, and (iii) pre-adsorption of DOM before CBZ introduction. Sorption of the DOM to both sorbents was irreversible and exhibited pronounced sorption-desorption hysteresis. Carbamazepine exhibited higher sorption affinity and nonlinearity, and a higher degree of desorption hysteresis with the bulk soil than the corresponding clay size fraction. This was probably due to specific interactions with polar soil organic matter fractions that are more common in the bulk soil. Co-introduction of CBZ and DOM to the soil did not significantly affect the sorption behavior of CBZ; however, following pre-adsorption of DOM by the bulk soil, an increase in sorption affinity and decrease in sorption linearity were observed. In this latter treatment, desorption hysteresis of CBZ was significantly increased for both sorbents. We hypothesize that this was due to either strong chemical interactions of CBZ with the adsorbed DOM or physical encapsulation of CBZ in DOM-clay complexes. Based on this study, we suggest that DOM facilitates stronger interactions of polar PCs with the solid surface. This mechanism can reduce PC desorption ability in soils.																	0047-2425					MAY	2011	40	3					942	948		10.2134/jeq2010.0446						WOS:000289886000028	21546680	
J	Tedetti, M; Cuet, P; Guigue, C; Goutx, M				Tedetti, Marc; Cuet, Pascale; Guigue, Catherine; Goutx, Madeleine			Characterization of dissolved organic matter in a coral reef ecosystem subjected to anthropogenic pressures (La Reunion Island, Indian Ocean) using multi-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												La Saline fringing reef is the most important coral reef complex of La Reunion Island (southwestern Indian Ocean; 21 degrees 07'S, 55 degrees 32'E). This ecosystem is subjected to anthropogenic pressures through river inputs and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The goal of this study was to characterize the pool of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in different water bodies of La Saline fringing reef ecosystem using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectrofluorometry. From EEMs, we identified the different fluorophores by the peak picking technique and determined two fluorescence indices issued from the literature: the humification index (HIX) and the biological index (BIX). The main known fluorophores were present within the sample set: humic-like A, humic-like C. marine humic-like M, tryptophan-like T1 and T2, and tyrosine-like B1 and B2. In some samples, unknown fluorophores ("U") were also detected. The surface oceanic waters located beyond the reef front displayed a typical oligotrophic marine signature, with a dominance of autochthonous/biological material (presence of peaks: Tl>B1>A>T2>M>C; HIX: 0.9 +/- 0.4; BIX: 23 +/- 1.1). In the reef waters, the autochthonous/biological fingerprint also dominated even though the content in humic substances was higher (same relative distribution of peaks; HIX: 1.6 +/- 0.6; BIX: 1.0 +/- 0.1). Sedimentary and volcanic SGD showed very different patterns with a strong terrestrial source for the former (A>T1>C>B1 and A>C>B1; HIX: 9.8 +/- 2.0; BIX: 0.8 +/- 0.0) and a weak terrestrial source for the latter (A>81>U3>82>C and A>U4>C; HIX: 2.4 +/- 0.3; BIX: 0.9 +/- 0.0). In the Hermitage River, both humic substances and protein-like material were abundant (Ti>A>U5>B1>C>B2; HIX: 2.3; BIX: 1.4). We provide evidences for the presence of anthropogenic DOM in some of these water bodies. Some oceanic samples ( presence of peaks U1 and U2) were likely contaminated by oil-derived PAHs from ships navigating around the reef front, whereas the Hermitage River was highly impacted by sewage effluents, numerous in this coastal area of La Reunion Island. We conclude that multi-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) coupled to the determination of HIX and BIX is a good tool for assessing the origin and distribution of DOM in the coral reef ecosystems submitted to anthropogenic impacts.

J	Loureiro, S; Rene, A; Garces, E; Camp, J; Vaque, D				Loureiro, Sofia; Rene, Albert; Garces, Esther; Camp, Jordi; Vaque, Dolors			Harmful algal blooms (HABs), dissolved organic matter (DOM), and planktonic microbial community dynamics at a near-shore and a harbour station influenced by upwelling (SW Iberian Peninsula)	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												The surface microalgal community, including harmful species, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and bacterial and viral populations were studied during an annual cycle (November 2007-October 2008) in a Near-shore (NS) and a Harbour (H) station located in an upwelling area (Sagres, SW Iberian Peninsula). The higher water residence time, water stability and shallowness of harbours in comparison with open waters likely contributed to the differences found between stations regarding chemical variables, statistical correlations and harmful algal proliferations. Also, several differences were noticed from a previous assessment (Loureiro et al., 2005) including higher SST, lower nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations, along with a shift in the microplankton community structure from diatom to nanoflagellate predominance. These variations feasibly reflect the response of this dynamic system to regional environmental modifications contributing to the understanding of common patterns in environmental change trends. The division of the sampling period into (1) non-upwelling (Non-Uw), (2) "spin-up" of upwelling (SU-Uw), and (3) "spin-down" and relaxation-downwelling (SD-Rel) stages allowed the identification of natural groupings of microplankton samples by Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and viruses were the most significant abiotic and biotic variables, respectively, contributing to the dissimilarities between these stages (SIMPER analysis) and, therefore, potentially affecting the microplankton community structure. Harmful algal species and a stable viral community appeared to be favoured by SD-Rel conditions. Data seem to indicate that both Gymnodinium catenatum and Heterosigma akashiwo, the most abundant potentially harmful species, have been imported into the sampling area. Also, the H location, together with potential retention sites developing around the Cabo de Sao Vicente upwelling centre, may contribute to the local accumulation of harmful species. The associations found between harmful algal species and bacterioplankton and virioplankton call for detailed studies in order to evaluate species-specific interactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yamashita, Y; Panton, A; Mahaffey, C; Jaffe, R				Yamashita, Youhei; Panton, Anouska; Mahaffey, Claire; Jaffe, Rudolf			Assessing the spatial and temporal variability of dissolved organic matter in Liverpool Bay using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and parallel factor analysis	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The spatial and diurnal tidal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), as evaluated by high-temperature catalytic oxidation and excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), respectively, were determined in Liverpool Bay. EEM-PARAFAC modeling resulted in six fluorescent components characterized as terrestrial humic-like (two), microbial humic-like (two), and protein-like (two). The spatial distributions of DOC and the four humic-like components were negatively correlated with salinity in the high-salinity waters observed in this study (30.41-33.75), suggesting that terrestrial DOM was conservatively distributed. The spatial patterns of protein-like components were largely different from those of DOC, humic-like components, and chlorophyll a, suggesting that these distributions were the combined result of production and degradation in the bay in addition to river inputs. These findings suggest that the DOM dynamics in Liverpool Bay are strongly controlled by river-dominated allochthonous DOM inputs with some less significant contributions of autochthonous DOM within the bay. In addition, the temporal variations of DOM associated with the diurnal tidal cycles were determined at one inshore (31.34-32.24 salinity) and one offshore (33.64-33.75 salinity) station in the bay. Negative linear relationships between salinity and DOM characteristics, i.e., DOC, humic-like, and protein-like components, were observed at the inshore station. In contrast, no relationship was observed at the offshore station, suggesting that the export of DOM through rivers and possibly tidal flats have a noticeable influence on DOM concentration and composition up to a relatively elevated salinity of around 33 in Liverpool Bay.

J	Dong, WM; Bian, YR; Liang, LY; Gu, BH				Dong, Wenming; Bian, Yongrong; Liang, Liyuan; Gu, Baohua			Binding Constants of Mercury and Dissolved Organic Matter Determined by a Modified Ion Exchange Technique	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Ion-exchange techniques have been widely used for determining the conditional stability constants (logK) between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and various metal ions in aqueous solution. An exception is mercuric ion, Hg2+, whose exceedingly strong binding with reduced sulfur or thiol-like functional groups in DOM makes the ion exchange reactions difficult. Using a Hg-selective thiol resin, we have developed a modified ion-exchange technique which overcomes this limitation. This technique allows not only the determination of binding constants between Hg2+ and DOM of varying origins, but also the discrimination of complexes with varying coordination numbers [i.e., 1:1 and 1:2 Hg:thiol-ligand (HgL) complexes]. Measured logK values of four selected DOM isolates varied slightly from 21.9 to 23.6 for 1:1 HgL complexes, and from 30.1 to 31.6 for 1:2 HgL2 complexes. These results suggest similar binding modes that are likely occurring between Hg2+ and key thiolate functional groups in DOM particularly at a relatively low Hg to DOM ratio. Future studies should further elucidate the nature and precise stoichiometries of binding between Hg2+ and DOM at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Modelling the complexation of Cd in soil solution at different temperatures using the UV-absorbance of dissolved organic matter	GEODERMA												It is well established that the soil temperature impacts on the mobility of Cd in soil but the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality in this process is still unclear. During a 42-day period, soil solutions were sampled from a Cd-contaminated soil incubated at 10,20 or 30 degrees C. The quantity and the quality of DOM were monitored over time as well as the concentration and the speciation of dissolved Cd. The fraction of Cd complexed by ligands (f(CdL)) increased over time and with the rise in soil temperature and exhibited a significant correlation with the absorbance of DOM at 254 nm. In contrast, the quantity of DOM did not much vary between soil solutions. These results suggest that, during incubation, the composition of DOM shifted to more aromatic compounds, assimilated to humic substances (HS), with higher Cd affinity. The kinetics of DOM aromatization and Cd complexation were described using thermal time. A first order model adequately fitted all the experimental data, suggesting that similar microbial processes responsible for the aromatization of DOM occurred at 10,20 and 30 degrees C. The fraction of Cd complexed by ligands was predicted by Visual MINTEQ using the solution properties measured at 140 day-degrees and the specific UV-absorbance of DOM (SUVA) monitored over thermal time. SUVA values were used to adjust the reactivity ratio of DOM (R). The model predictions were highly correlated with the measured values but the overestimated f(CdL). It is concluded that the aromaticity of DOM should be taken into account to predict the impact of soil temperature on the complexation of Cd in rewetted soils. The relation between SUVA values and the HS fraction of DOM still needs, however, to be worked out. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Walker, KM; Boyer, TH				Walker, Krystal M.; Boyer, Treavor H.			Long-term performance of bicarbonate-form anion exchange: Removal of dissolved organic matter and bromide from the St. Johns River, FL, USA	WATER RESEARCH												The goal of this research was to evaluate the long-term performance of magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) treatment using bicarbonate as the mobile counter ion (i.e., MIEX-HCO(3)) and sodium bicarbonate for regeneration. This work is important because there are many unknowns concerning the affinity and regeneration efficiency of bicarbonate-form anion exchange, whereas chloride-form anion exchange (i.e., MIEX-Cl resin) is well-studied. Raw water samples were collected approximately two times per month for one year from a single location on the St. Johns River (SJR), FL, USA. The SJR is characterized by high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 12-26 mg C/L) and bromide (550-1100 mu g,/L), and is being considered as an alternative drinking water supply. Jar tests were conducted using MIEX-HCO(3) resin, and MIEX-Cl resin was used as a baseline for comparison. The same batch of MIEX-HCO(3) and MIEX-Cl resin was used for the entire study, which was accomplished by regenerating the resins after each jar test in concentrated solutions of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, respectively, and resulted in 21 regeneration cycles. Maximum removal efficiency was achieved with fresh MIEX-HCO(3) resin and virgin MIEX-Cl resin. Both forms of fresh/virgin MIEX resin also had the same affinity sequence with sulfate approximate to UV-absorbing substance > DOC > bromide. The removal efficiency of both forms of MIEX resin decreased as the number of regeneration cycles increased, with MIEX-HCO(3) resin showing 7-18% lower removals than MIEX-Cl resin after 21 regeneration cycles. The affinity sequence of regenerated MIEX-HCO(3) and MIEX-Cl resins differed from fresh resin with UV-absorbing substances > DOC > sulfate > bromide. Scanning electron microscopy and simulated MIEX-HCO(3) treatment under rapidly changing water quality were also used to improve the understanding of bicarbonate-form anion exchange. The major contribution of this research is a systematic study of the extended use of bicarbonate-form anion exchange resin in the context of affinity, regeneration efficiency, and changing water quality.

J	Linlin, W; Xuan, Z; Meng, Z				Linlin, Wu; Xuan, Zhao; Meng, Zhang			Removal of dissolved organic matter in municipal effluent with ozonation, slow sand filtration and nanofiltration as high quality pre-treatment option for artificial groundwater recharge	CHEMOSPHERE												In the paper the combination process of ozonation, slow sand filtration (SSF) and nanofiltration (NF) was investigated with respect to dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal as high quality pre-treatment option for artificial groundwater recharge. With the help of ozonation leading to breakdown of the large organic molecules, SSF preferentially removes soluble microbial by-product-like substances and DOM with molecular weight (MW) less than 1.0 kDa. NF, however, removes aromatic, humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances efficiently and specially removes DOM with MW above 1.0 kDa. The residual DOM of the membrane permeate is dominated by small organics with MW 500 Da, which can be further reduced by the aquifer treatment, despite of the very low concentration. Consequently, the O-3/SSF/NF system offers a complementary process in DOM removal. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) can be reduced from 6.5 +/- 1.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg L-1 and from 267 +/- 24 to 52 +/- 6 mu g L-1, respectively. The very low DOC concentration of 0.6 +/- 0.2 mg L-1 and THMFP of 44 +/- 4 mu g L-1 can be reached after the aquifer treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured variability in the Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn affinity of 23 DOM samples isolated by reverse osmosis from freshwaters in natural, agricultural, and urban areas. Affinities at uniform pH and ionic composition were assayed at low, environmentally relevant free Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn activities. The C-normalized metal binding of DOM varied 4-fold (Cu) or about 10-fold (Cd, Ni, Zn) among samples. The dissolved organic carbon concentration ranged only 9-fold in the waters, illustrating that DOM quality is an equally important parameter for metal complexation as DOM quantity. The UV-absorbance of DOM explained metal affinity only for waters receiving few urban inputs, indicating that in those waters, aromatic humic substances are the dominant metal chelators. Larger metal affinities were found for DOM from waters with urban inputs. Aminopolycarboxylate ligands (mainly EDTA) were detected at concentrations up to 0.14 mu M and partly explained the larger metal affinity. Nickel concentrations in these surface waters are strongly related to EDTA concentrations (R-2 = 0.96) and this is underpinned by speciation calculations. It is concluded that metal complexation in waters with anthropogenic discharges is larger than that estimated with models that only take into account binding on humic substances.

The effects of dissolved organic matter and pH on sampling rates for polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS)	CHEMOSPHERE												The effect of solution pH and levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the sampling rates for model pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting substance (EDS) by polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) was investigated in laboratory experiments. A commercially available POCIS configuration containing neutral Oasis HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) resin (i.e. pharmaceutical POCIS) and two POCIS configurations prepared in-house containing MAX and MCX anion and cation exchange resins, respectively were tested for uptake of 21 model PPCPs and EDS, including acidic, phenolic, basic and neutral compounds. Laboratory experiments were conducted with dechlorinated tap water over a pH range of 3,7 and 9. The effects of DOM were studied using natural water from an oligotrophic lake in Ontario, Canada (i.e. Plastic Lake) spiked with different amounts of DOM (the concentration of dissolved organic carbon ranged from 3 to 5 mg L(-1) in uptake experiments). In experiments with the commercial (HLB) POCIS, the MCX-POCIS and the MAX-POCIS, the sampling rates generally increased with pH for basic compounds and declined with pH for acidic compounds. However, the sampling rates were relatively constant across the pH range for phenols with high pKa values (i.e. bisphenol A, estrone, estradiol, triclosan) and for the neutral pharmaceutical, carbamazepine. Thus, uptake was greatest when the amount of the neutral species in solution was maximized relative to the ionized species. Although the solution pH affected the uptake of some model ionic compounds, the effect was by less than a factor of 3. There was no significant effect of DOM on sampling rates from Plastic Lake. However, uptake rates in different aqueous matrixes declined in the order of deionized water > Plastic Lake water > dechlorinated tap water, so other parameters must affect uptake into POCIS, although this influence will be minor. MAX-POCIS and MCX-POCIS showed little advantage over the commercial POCIS configuration for monitoring in natural waters. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, GA; Lin, C; Chen, LA; Yang, H				Chen, Guang; Lin, Chao; Chen, Liang; Yang, Hong			Effect of polar-dissolved organic matter fractions on the mobility of prometryne in soil	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Using two fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with different polarity, we carried out the experiments with standard batch equilibration, soil column leaching, and soil thin layer chromatography to investigate the behavior of the herbicide prometryne in soils. The purpose of the study was to: (1) separate DOM into hydrophilic matter and hydrophobic acid forms and characterize their chemical properties; (2) analyze interaction between the DOM fractions and prometryne in soils. The herbicide prometryne was tested on Eutric gleysols soils. Two forms of DOM were prepared from lake sludge (SL) and rice straw (ST), from which hydrophilic matter (HiM) and hydrophobic acid (HoA) were individually extracted. The sorption and desorption experiments were carried out using the standard batch equilibration method. Soil column leaching was performed with soil samples packed into PVC columns (30 x 4.5 cm i.d.) to a bulk density of about 1.27 g cm(-3). Soil thin layer chromatography was performed using soil (15 g) and water (10 mL) mixture that was spread as a 0.7 mm thick layer over 20 x 10-cm glass plates. Two DOM fractions, HiM and HoA, reduced prometryne sorption to soils and increased mobility of prometryne in soils. The results were supported by soil column and plate analyses. Composition and structure of the two DOM fractions were analyzed using Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra. HiM fractions contained more unsaturated components and functional nitrogen groups and therefore appeared more effective on prometryne mobility than HoA. These results suggest that HoA and HiM differentially affect the environmental behavior of prometryne in soils. DOM extracted from either ST or SL can be grouped into HiM and HoA categories. HiM fractions contained more DOC than HoA fractions. Analysis using FT-IR and EEM fluorescence spectra revealed that HiM fractions contained more unsaturated components and functional nitrogen groups than HoA fractions. The apparent difference may explain the fact that the HiM fractions were more effective on mobility of prometryne in the soil than HoA.																	1439-0108					APR	2011	11	3					395	405		10.1007/s11368-010-0316-1						WOS:000288964700001		
J	Yuan, TA; Yuan, Y; Zhou, SG; Li, FB; Liu, Z; Zhuang, L				Yuan, Tian; Yuan, Yong; Zhou, Shungui; Li, Fangbai; Liu, Zhi; Zhuang, Li			A rapid and simple electrochemical method for evaluating the electron transfer capacities of dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												The evaluation of the electron transfer capacities (ETC) of DOM is important to understand their roles in microbial activity, pollution degradation, and metal mobility. Those currently used methods to quantify ETC, such as Zn and Fe(3+) assays, are normally time consuming and usually require experience and skills to achieve reproducible results. The aim of this paper is to develop a rapid and simple approach to accurately and directly quantify the ETC of DOM. DOM was extracted from sewage sludge compost. Cycle voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the redox behavior of DOM derived from sludge compost. Chronoamperometry (CA) was employed to study the electron-accepting capacities (EAC) and electron-donating capacities (EDC) by applying fixed positive or negative potentials to a working electrode in a conventional three-electrode cell. For comparison, the EAC and EDC of DOM were also determined by chemical methods using Zn as the reductant and Fe(3+) as the oxidant. The reversible electron transfer of DOM was studied electrochemically by CA with a multi-potential step technique. The CV of sludge DOM displayed that a couple of quasi-reversible redox peaks with a formal potential of -0.866 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), demonstrating that the DOM was capable of reversibly transferring electrons. The value of EAC was determined by CA to be 361.6 mu mol(e-) (g C)(-1) at a potential of -0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and the value of initial EDC was 5.0 mu mol(e-) (g C)(-1) at a potential of +0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Both the values of EAC and EDC depended on the applied potentials on the working electrode. The results determined by the proposed method were comparable with those by using chemical methods. A rapid electrochemical approach was employed to investigate the EAC and EDC of DOM extracted from sewage sludge compost. The acquired values of EAC and EDC were comparable with those measured by chemical methods using zinc as the reductant and ferric iron as the oxidant. The determination could be completed in tens of seconds, which was faster and more direct than conventional chemical methods.

Seasonal and hydrologic drivers of dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the upper Kuparuk River, Alaskan Arctic	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												As the planet warms, widespread changes in Arctic hydrology and biogeochemistry have been documented and these changes are expected to accelerate in the future. Improved understanding of the behavior of water-borne constituents in Arctic rivers with varying hydrologic conditions, including seasonal variations in discharge-concentration relationships, will improve our ability to anticipate future changes in biogeochemical budgets due to changing hydrology. We studied the relationship between seasonal water discharge and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) and nutrient concentrations in the upper Kuparuk River, Arctic Alaska. Fluxes of most constituents were highest during initial snowmelt runoff in spring, indicating that this historically under-studied period contributes significantly to total annual export. In particular, the initial snowmelt period (the stream is completely frozen during the winter) accounted for upwards of 35% of total export of DOC and DON estimated for the entire study period. DOC and DON concentrations were positively correlated with discharge whereas nitrate (NO(3) (-)) and silicate were negatively correlated with discharge throughout the study. However, discharge-specific DOC and DON concentrations (i.e. concentrations compared at the same discharge level) decreased over the summer whereas discharge-specific concentrations of NO(3) (-) and silicate increased. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH(4) (+)) were negatively correlated with discharge during the spring thaw, but were less predictable with respect to discharge thereafter. These data provide valuable information on how Arctic watershed biogeochemistry will be affected by future changes in temperature, snowfall, and rainfall in the Arctic. In particular, our results add to a growing body of research showing that nutrient export per unit of stream discharge, particularly NO(3) (-), is increasing in the Arctic.

J	Larmagnat, S; Neuweiler, F				Larmagnat, Stephanie; Neuweiler, Fritz			Exploring a link between Atlantic coral mounds and Phanerozoic carbonate mudmounds: Insights from pore water fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), Pen Duick mounds, offshore Morocco	MARINE GEOLOGY												This study explores a genetic link between modern Atlantic coral mounds and ancient, sponge-rich carbonate mudmounds based on Ca-carbonate authigenesis driven by induced-and-supported organomineralization (ISOM). The potential for ISOM in Atlantic coral mounds is tracked by peak patterns of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) present in pore waters down to 3 m of sediment depth (Gamma mound, Beta mound, Pen Duick escarpment, offshore Morocco). All pore waters display a biological activity (protein-like fluorescence) with two local maxima, occurring from the surface to about 1 m of sediment depth and below 2 m of sediment depth. Protein-like fluorescence correlates well with the fluorescence of porphyrin-like compounds. A sample of bottom water displays a blue-shifted variety of protein-like fluorescence suggesting hydrolysis and diffusion from the benthic realm into the water column. A significant accumulation of refractory FDOM does not occur in shallower than 2 m of sediment depth. It is accompanied by a late stage of biodegradation of organic matter (peak Geol.-A; ex. 224 +/- 2 nm; em. 385 8 nm) and the occurrence of a new fluorescence peak Q that is expressed along an emission band with peak Geol.-A ( peak Q; ex. 295 5 nm; em. 385 1 nm). With caution, peak Q represents a product of exudation from anaerobic microorganisms and/or derives from siderophore-like pigments (pyocyanine-like; from Pseudomonas species). Permineralizing fluids that are characteristic for ISOM are locally present within the shallow subsurface and reach a maximum intensity at about 1 m of sediment depth. However, no ISOM-related authigenic carbonate was observed. Both the lack of organic substrates that is due to the absence of degrading connective tissues from a cryptic community and the high amount of infiltrated mud that acts as a sorbent might explain the absence of ISOM in Gamma mound sediments. Labyrinthine deposits of coral rubble or current-swept coral mounds are prone to host a sponge-rich cryptic community and therefore, in their deeper parts, should provide a variety of substrates for ISOM during suboxic cycling of natural organic matter. In such a view, the modern coral-rich mound system, which by itself appears diverse and with a variety of controlling factors, maintains an excellent potential to drive ISOM and to share a crucial process of early diagenesis with Phanerozoic spongerich carbonate mudmounds.

Vertical change in the composition of marine humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the subtropical western North Pacific and its relation to photoreactivity	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The vertical change in the composition of marine humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOMM) and its controlling factors were examined in the subtropical western North Pacific. Fluorescence intensity and molecular weight distribution were measured on the hydrophobic fraction of FDOMM (O-FDOMM) fractionated with ODS solid phase extraction. Although the same vertical trends with low fluorescence intensity in surface waters and high in deep waters were observed both for bulk FDOMM and O-FDOMM, the contribution of O-FDOMM to bulk FDOMM decreased with depth. A sunlight irradiation experiment of deep seawater revealed that the fluorescence intensity of O-FDOMM as well as bulk FDOMM tended to decrease, whereas the contribution of O-FDOMM to FDOMM increased from 42% to 62% throughout the irradiation experiment. This suggests that the hydrophobic fraction is more refractory to photoirradiation than a hydrophilic one and that the difference of photo-lability results in the vertical change of the contribution of O-FDOMM to FDOMM. Molecular weight ( MW) distributions of O-FDOMM were measured by high-performance size exclusion chromatography. O-FDOMM was composed of three MW fractions throughout the samples examined and the compositional change was noted with an increase in the high MW fraction with depth. The photoirradiation experiment of deep seawater sample clearly showed that a high MW fraction was more susceptible than a low MW fraction of O-FDOMM. The present study strongly suggests that FDOMM is composed of some fractions with different photoreactivity, and that photoirradiation is the main factor controlling the compositional change in FDOMM with depth. The fate of each fraction of FDOMM after photoirradiation is presumably one of the key processes in the biogeochemical cycle of marine DOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Reactions between extraction solvent and DOM might influence data evaluation parameters, which are used to compare DOM of different origin. Potential reactions between methanol and solid-phase extracted marine DOM (SPE-DOM) and their influence on FT-ICR MS data were studied on a molecular level. For elemental formula assignments 9 isotopes were included in the evaluation, and different strategies based on isotope ratios and mass peak intervals were applied to achieve data sets of single assignments. DOM was eluted from the sorbent with methanol, methanol-(13)C-D(4) and acetonitrile and stored at 20 degrees C and -20 degrees C. Under both storage conditions HID exchanges were detected. In addition, esterifications were detected in the extract stored at 20 degrees C. but did not result in significant differences in the mass peak magnitudes. Hence, no changes of the weighted average H/C and O/C ratios or other values such as Kendrick mass defect (KMD) and double bond equivalents (DBE) were observed. Acetonitrile was tested as an alternative solvent. Both, methanol or acetonitrile can be used to extract marine DOM from sorbents if samples are immediately stored at -20 degrees C after the SPE process. However, FT-ICR MS data of DOM samples extracted with different solvents showed substantial differences as expected and should not be directly compared. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The supply and characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Arctic Ocean: Pan Arctic trends and differences	MARINE CHEMISTRY												A comprehensive data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption measurements is analysed in light of tracing the supply and distribution of dissolved organic matter in the Arctic Ocean. Two years of river data from six major Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Oh, Mackenzie, Yenisei, and Yukon) and measurements from a transect across the Arctic Ocean are presented. The results show that although the Lena River currently dominates the supply of DOC and CDOM, climate change induced increases in base flow discharge will likely increase the contribution of the Yenisei River. Seasonal variations in the spectral characteristics of CDOM in the rivers reflected the shift in the dominant source of organic matter from modern plant litter in the spring freshet to older more degraded material during winter low flow periods. Strong correlations were found between the river loading of CDOM and DOC across the systems studied indicating that in situ CDOM sensors could be used in the future to improve estimates of riverine DOC loading. CDOM in the surface waters of the Eurasian Basin was largely characterised as riverine material although extrapolations to riverine end member concentrations suggested that approximately half the riverine CDOM is removed during its transport across the shelf. In contrast the Canadian Basin surface waters were characterised by a much greater proportion of autochthonous CDOM. These differences in DOM quality in the surface waters of the two basins are hypothesised to also influence the extent to which material is remineralised during its passage through the Arctic Ocean.

Two humic-like (Cl and C3), one tryptophan-like (C4) and one possible protein-like (C2) component was identified by PARAFAC and their behavior in the river-estuary-coastal interface was evaluated. The spatial distributions of the maximum fluorescence (F(max)) for the fluorescent components showed a remarkable loss in the upper estuary. The following significant addition of all components in the low salinity turbidity maximum zone suggested the inputs from riverine source, sediment resuspension and the surrounding mangrove ecosystem. Cl, C2 and C3 showed conservative behavior in the middle and lower estuary indicated by the linear relationship between their fluorescence intensities and salinity in the five cruises. However, the tryptophan-like C4 received widespread additions (likely from autochthonous production) in the estuary. Although the humic-like Cl and C3 showed no significant variation in the estuary-coastal interface, C2 and C4 decreased more rapidly beyond this interface, indicating the significant influence of coastal current to this estuarine environment. The seasonal variation of tryptophan-like C4 was characterized by higher F(max) values in the upper to middle estuary in the dry season, which is in contrast to that of the humic-like C3. Correlation analysis with DOC showed that the fluorescence intensity of Cl (or C2 and C3) was suitable for tracing DOC dynamics in this estuary. These results indicated different mixing behavior and temporal variability for different fluorescent components in this dynamic estuarine environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of soil oven-drying on concentrations and speciation of trace metals and dissolved organic matter in soil solution extracts of sandy soils	GEODERMA												Weak salt extracts can be used to assess the availability of trace metals for leaching and uptake by soil organisms and plants in soil. Before extraction, the International Organization for Standardization recommends to dry soils in an oven at a temperature of 40 degrees C. Effects of soil oven-drying on different fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the effect thereof on total concentrations and speciation of trace metals in weak salt extracts have, however, not been quantified yet. In this study, free metal concentrations and DOM speciation were determined in 2 mM Ca(NO(3))(2) extracts obtained from twelve field-contaminated soils in their field-moist state and after drying at 40 degrees C. Free metal concentrations were measured with the Donnan Membrane Technique. DOM was fractioned into humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and hydrophilic (Hy) compounds. Soil oven-drying led to significant increases in the concentrations of total DOM and total dissolved Cu and Ni. For the measurement of total dissolved Cu and Ni concentrations, it is, therefore, better to use field-moist soils. The release of Hy compounds was mainly responsible for the increase in DOM, which accounted for 64 to 77% of the increase in total dissolved organic carbon. Soil oven-drying left the free Cd(2+), Cr(3+), Cu(2+), Ni(2+), and Zn(2+) concentrations unchanged. Both field-moist and oven-dried soils can, therefore, be used for the measurement of free metal concentrations. Free Cd(2+), Cu(2+), Ni(2+), and Zn(2+) concentrations were predicted very well for both field-moist and oven-dried soils using ORCHESTRA, which includes the NICA-Donnan model. However, poor predictions were obtained for Cr(3+), for which better NICA parameters need to be derived. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The origin and function of dissolved organic matter in agro-urban coastal streams	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Streams draining urban and agriculture catchments are often a source of inorganic nutrients to downstream aquatic ecosystems, but little is known about how changes in land use influence the quality and biodegradability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We used parallel factor analysis of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy and biodegradation incubations to examine how DOM composition influences bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface waters of urban and agricultural catchments during summer (low flow), winter (high flow) and spring (flow recession). Percent bioavailable DOC was variable for all catchments (2-57%) and negatively related to percent humic-like fluorescence, but positively related to percent protein-like fluorescence and simple fluorescence metrics of DOM precursor material (fluorescence index and beta:alpha values). Conversely, highly variable DOC concentrations (2-140 mg L(-1)) were negatively related to protein-like fluorescence and positively related to humic-like fluorescence. Elevated concentrations of DOC (> 30 mg L(-1)) in agro-urban streams revealed fluorescence indices (< 1.3) typical of wetland and forest-dominated ecosystems, suggesting that enriched stream DOM is either derived from the destabilization of legacy soil carbon or currently produced from remnant wetlands and patches of native vegetation. Overall, we demonstrate that fluorescence characteristics can be used to predict bioavailable DOC in human-dominated catchments to better understand the flow of carbon and nutrients in aquatic food webs for improved monitoring and management of coastal ecosystems.

Although it is believed that a decrease in metal ion concentration should lead to a decrease in metal bioavailability, previous work has shown that Pb uptake by Mytilus edulis gills is greatly enhanced in the presence of humic acids. In the present work, the effect of more soluble organic matter (fulvic acids and DOM extracted from river) on Pb uptake by mussels and their gills is studied. Pb complexation by these organic substances was measured by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) and it is proven that Pb uptake by mussel gills in the presence of fulvic acids can be successfully predicted according to ASV-labile Pb concentrations. However, Pb uptake by whole mussels in the presence of river DOM is slightly higher than predicted on the basis of ASV measurements. The possible reasons leading to different effects of DOM on Pb uptake by mussels are discussed according to physicochemical properties of DOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of harmful algal species and food concentration on zooplankton grazer production of dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients	HARMFUL ALGAE												Harmful algal blooms (HABs), including toxic species, have been increasing in frequency, range, and duration over the past several decades. The effect of a harmful or toxic algal diet on zooplankton nutrient regeneration, however, has not been previously examined. In this study, we determined the effects of non-bloom and bloom concentrations of non-toxic and toxic cultures of HAB species Prorocentrum minimum and Karlodinium veneficum on grazing and production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP), and inorganic nutrients, ammonium (NH(4)(+)) and phosphate (PO(4)(3-)), by the copepod Acartia tonsa and the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina. Ingestion rates of grazers were significantly higher while feeding on bloom algal concentrations compared to non-bloom algal concentrations, but were always below 1% body C d(-1) for A. tonsa (ingestion rate range of 0.5-31 ng C individual(-1) d(-1)) and below 2% body C d(-1) for O. marina (range of 0.1-8.8 pg C individual(-1) d(-1)). However, rates of inorganic nutrient and dissolved organic matter (DOM) release, when detected, were always >100% of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) ingested. Additionally, the quantity and forms (organic vs. inorganic) of nutrients released by zooplankton were significantly different between non-toxic and toxic algal treatments, and typically higher grazer DOM release occurred while feeding on toxic algal cultures. DOM was the only detected form of nutrient released from O. marina, and DON and DOP were significant portions of total dissolved N and P released for A. tonsa feeding on toxic K. veneficum (69-84% and 73%, respectively). Low grazing rates on all algal diets used in our study, regardless of cell concentration or toxicity, likely resulted in starvation and subsequent catabolism of grazer body tissue. The potential for additional factors affecting variable grazer nutrient release between toxic and non-toxic algal treatments, including algal nutrient quality and direct toxic effects, are discussed. Our results suggest these grazers may not be capable of controlling bloom formation of these HAB species, and that nutrient cycling dynamics in the coastal ocean may change with increases in the presence of harmful and toxic algal blooms.

Variations in chromophoric dissolved organic matter and its influence on the use of pigment-specific fluorimeters in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The variability of colored material (yellow substances, chromophoric dissolved organic matter [CDOM]) in Great Lakes water on the operation of a submersible pigment-based fluorimeter (FluoroProbe) was assessed. The FluoroProbe is designed to account for the influence of ambient CDOM on fluorimetric analysis of natural waters by using background yellow substance content to correct for fluorescence that is not due to phytoplankton. The objective of this study was to assess FluoroProbe performance as well as determine the variability of CDOM that has a bearing on instrument use. This study focused on Lakes Ontario and Huron in spring and summer and employed up to three FluoroProbes for simultaneous comparisons of performance, as assessed by comparing in situ versus extracted concentrations of chlorophyll-a. Conclusions from this study are: FluoroProbes are not equally accurate; yellow substance correction factors obtained by FluoroProbes are instrument specific; there are seasonal differences in yellow substance correction factors between summer and spring and among thermal strata in summer, in Lakes Huron and Ontario.The observed differences among yellow substance correction factors are attributed to chromophoric material that was assessed independently by measuring CDOM using a separate fluorimetric technique and by measuring in situ UV absorption coefficients. These results suggest that the use of FluoroProbes and related instruments for phytoplankton surveillance and monitoring initiatives must account for differences in ambient CDOM.

Eight mesocosms (similar to 1400 L) were filled with natural seawater, and two replicate mesocosms each were incubated by raising temperature by +0, +2, +4 and +6 degrees C, respectively. The enclosed water was initially fertilized with inorganic nutrients to induce the development of phytoplankton blooms, which were then dominated by diatoms. Over a 4-week period, dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) and dissolved amino acids (DAA) were determined as major components of freshly produced, labile to semi-labile DOM. In all mesocosms, the increase in DCCHO concentration occurred sharply after the peak of chlorophyll a concentration, when nutrients became depleted. Rising temperature resulted in an earlier, faster and higher accumulation of DCCHO and of combined glucose predominantly. DCCHO yielded a maximum percentage of 35, 40, 49 and 59% of total combined carbohydrates in the +0, +2, +4 and +6 degrees C treatments, respectively. Accumulation of DAA occurred more continuously and at an average rate of 0.79 +/- 0.20 nmol L(-1) h(-1), but was not affected by rising temperature. Owing to the higher accumulation of DCCHO, the C:N ratio of DOM increased strongly during the course of the bloom, with higher ratios in the warmer treatments. Our study suggests that warming increases the extracellular release of carbohydrates from phytoplankton and, therefore, may affect the bottom-up control of the microbial loop in cold seas in the future.																	0142-7873					MAR	2011	33	3					357	372		10.1093/plankt/fbq122						WOS:000287025500002

We have examined the sorption behaviour of three highly hydrophobic pesticides (the herbicide pendimethalin and the insecticides a-cypermethrin and deltamethrin) on a Mediterranean agricultural soil using the batch equilibration method. We considered wastewater, extracts from urban sewage sludge with different dissolved organic carbon contents, and inorganic salt solutions, using Milli Q water as a control. All pesticides were strongly retained by soil although some sorption occurred on the walls of the laboratory containers, especially when wastewater and inorganic salt solutions were used. The calculation of distribution constants by measuring pesticide concentrations in soil and solution indicated that pendimethalin sorption was not affected whereas a-cypermethrin and deltamethrin retention were significantly enhanced (ca. 5 and 2 times, respectively) when wastewater or salt solutions were employed. We therefore conclude that the increased sorption of the two pesticides caused by wastewater cannot be only the result of its dissolved organic carbon content, but also of the simultaneous presence of inorganic salts in the solution.

Scott			Variability in dissolved organic matter fluorescence and reduced sulfur concentration in coastal marine and estuarine environments	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Fluorescence characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and measurements of Cr-reducible sulfide (CRS) are presented for 72 coastal marine and estuarine water samples obtained from the USA and Canada. Each sample is identified according to source: terrigenous, autochthonous, wastewater or mixed. Fluorescence data are resolved into contributions from humic, fulvic, tyrosine and tryptophan-like fluorophores. Humic and fulvic-like fluorophores correlate well with dissolved organic C (DOC) (r(2) = 0.73 and 0.71, respectively) but tyrosine and tryptophan-like fluorophores show no correlation with DOC. Quality factors are identified by normalization of fluorescence contributions to DOC. Humic and fulvic components show no statistical differences between sources but the amino acid-like fluorescence quality factors show significant variations between source, with highest values for autochthonous sources (0.07 +/- 0.01 arbitrary fluorescence units per mg of C) versus low values (0.015 +/- 0.005) for terrigenous source waters. CRS concentrations are highly variable from 0.07 +/- 0.01 to 7703 +/- 98 nM and do no correlate with DOC except when terrigenous source waters (n = 13) are separated out from the total sample set (r(2) = 0.55). There is an open question in the literature: does DOC source matter in terms of protective effects towards metal toxicity? Here is shown that DOC molecular-level quality does vary and that this variation is mostly in terms of the contributions of amino acids to total fluorescence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Scott			Effects of dissolved organic matter and reduced sulphur on copper bioavailability in coastal marine environments	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Copper-induced toxicity in aqueous systems depends on its speciation and bioavailability. Natural organic matter (NOM) and reduced sulphur species can complex copper, influencing speciation and decreasing bioavailability. NOM composition in estuaries can vary, depending on inputs of terrigenous, autochthonous, or wastewater source material. At a molecular level, variability in NOM quality potentially results in different extents of copper binding. The aims of this study were to measure acute copper EC(50) values in coastal marine and estuarine waters, and identify the relationships between total dissolved copper EC(50) values and measured water chemistry parameters proportional to NOM and reduced sulphur composition. This has implications on the development of marine-specific toxicity prediction models. NOM was characterised using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and fluorescence measurements, combined with spectral resolution techniques, to quantify humic-, fulvic-, tryptophan-, and tyrosine-like fractions. Reduced sulphur was measured by the chromium-reducible sulphide (CRS) technique. Acute copper toxicity tests were performed on samples expressing extreme DOC, fluorescent terrigenous, autochthonous, and CRS concentrations. The results show significant differences in NOM quality, independent of DOC concentration. CRS is variable among the samples: concentrations ranging from 4 to 40 nM. The toxicity results suggest DOC as a very good predictive measure of copper EC(50) in estuaries (r(2)=0.87) independent of NOM quality. Furthermore, for filtered samples, CRS exists at concentrations that would be saturated with copper at measured EC(50), suggesting that while CRS might bind Cu and decrease bioavailability, it does not control copper speciation at toxicologically relevant concentrations and therefore is not a good predictive measure of copper toxicity in filtered samples. 2010 (C) Elsevier Inc.

Tracing the source and fate of dissolved organic matter in soil after incorporation of a C-13 labelled residue: A batch incubation study	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												While dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil solution is a small but reactive fraction of soil organic matter, its source and dynamics are unclear. A laboratory incubation experiment was set up with an agricultural topsoil amended with C-13 labelled maize straw. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in soil solution increased sharply from 25 to 186 mg C L-1 4 h after maize amendment, but rapidly decreased to 42 mg C L-1 and reached control values at and beyond 2 months. About 65% of DOM was straw derived after 4 h, decreasing to 29% after one day and only 1.3% after 240 days. A significant priming effect of the straw on the release of autochthonous DOM was found. The DOM fractionation with DAX-8 resin revealed that 98% of the straw derived DOM was hydrophilic in the initial pulse while this hydrophilic fraction was 20-30% in control samples. This was in line with the specific UV absorbance of the DOM which was significantly lower in the samples amended with maize residues than in the control samples. The delta C-13 of the respired CO2 matched that of DOC in the first day after amendment but exceeded it in following days. The straw derived C fractions in respired CO2 and in microbial biomass were similar between 57 and 240 days after amendment but were 3-10 fold above those in the DOM. This suggests that the solubilisation of C from the straw is in steady state with the DOM degradation or that part of the straw is directly mineralised without going into solution. This study shows that residue application releases a pulse of hydrophilic DOM that temporarily (<3 days) dominates the soil DOM pool and the degradable C. However, beyond that pulse the majority of DOM is derived from soil organic matter and its isotope signature differs from microbial biomass and respired C, casting doubt that the DOM pool in the soil solution is the major bioaccessible C pool in soil.

J	Wenk, J; von Gunten, U; Canonica, S				Wenk, Jannis; von Gunten, Urs; Canonica, Silvio			Effect of Dissolved Organic Matter on the Transformation of Contaminants Induced by Excited Triplet States and the Hydroxyl Radical	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has recently been shown to reduce the transformation rate of various aqueous organic contaminants submitted to oxidation by excited triplet states, apparently by inhibiting the transformation of oxidation intermediates. The main goals of the present study were to evaluate in more detail the effect of concentration and type of DOM on the triplet-induced transformation rate of four selected organic compounds and to check for an analogous inhibition effect in the case of oxidation induced by hydroxyl radical. A marked inhibition by DOM of triplet-induced oxidation was observed for N,N-dirnethylaniline (DMA) and the two antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TRI), with DOM of terrestrial origin being a more effective inhibitor than DOM of aquatic origin. The results are important to understand the role of D OM both as a photosensitizer and as an inhibitor for the triplet-induced transformation of aquatic contaminants. In contrast, no DOM-induced reduction in second-order rate constant could be observed in competition kinetics experiments for the reaction of hydroxyl radical with a series of 15 organic compounds, covering several dasses of aromatic contaminants, indicating that Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) used as reference DOM does not affect this reaction mechanism.																	0013-936X					FEB 15	2011	45	4					1334	1340		10.1021/es102212t						WOS:000287122400027	21271693

Bernard			Estimation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya river plume regions using above-surface hyperspectral remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A method for the inversion of hyperspectral remote sensing was developed to determine the absorption coefficient for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya river plume regions and the northern Gulf of Mexico, where water types vary from Case 1 to turbid Case 2. Above-surface hyperspectral remote sensing data were measured by a ship-mounted spectroradiometer and then used to estimate CDOM. Simultaneously, water absorption and attenuation coefficients, CDOM and chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidities, and other related water properties were also measured at very high resolution (0.5-2 m) using in situ, underwater, and flow-through (shipboard, pumped) optical sensors. We separate a(g), the absorption coefficient a of CDOM, from a(dg) (a of CDOM and nonalgal particles) based on two absorption-backscattering relationships. The first is between a(d) (a of nonalgal particles) and b(bp) (total particulate backscattering coefficient), and the second is between a(p) (a of total particles) and bbp. These two relationships are referred as a(d)-based and a(p)-based methods, respectively. Consequently, based on Lee's quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA), we developed the so-called Extended Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA-E) to decompose a(dg), using both a(d)-based and a(p)-based methods. The absorption-backscattering relationships and the QAA-E were tested using synthetic and in situ data from the International Ocean-Colour Coordinating Group (IOCCG) as well as our own field data. The results indicate the a(d)-based method is relatively better than the a(p) -based method. The accuracy of CDOM estimation is significantly improved by separating a(g) from a(dg) (R(2) = 0.81 and 0.65 for synthetic and in situ data, respectively). The sensitivities of the newly introduced coefficients were also analyzed to ensure QAA-E is robust.

Assessing the optical changes in dissolved organic matter in humic lakes by spectral slope distributions	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY												The impact of photodegradation and mixing processes on the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was examined using a distribution of absorption spectral slopes and fluorescence measurements in two Argentine lakes. By examining the variability of the absorption spectral slopes throughout the ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, it was possible to determine which wavelength intervals were most sensitive to dominant loss processes. For DOM photodegradation, results show that increases in the absorption spectral slope between 265 and 305 nm were highly sensitive to increased exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. A slightly larger wavelength range (265-340 nm) was found to be influenced when both mixing and photodegradation processes were considered, in terms DOM residence time, DOM absorption and UV diffuse attenuation coefficients. This same interval of spectral slopes (265-340 nm) was found to highly correlate with changes in fluorescence emission/excitation in wavelengths that are typically associated with terrestrial humic-like DOM. The identification of specific wavelength intervals, rather than the use of standard wavelength intervals or ratios, improved our ability to identify the dominant dissolved organic matter (humic-like) and major loss mechanisms (photodegradation) in these lakes.

Decomposition of dissolved organic matter released by an isolate of Microcystis aeruginosa and morphological profile of the associated bacterial community	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												This study concerns the kinetics of bacterial degradation of two fractions (molecular mass) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by Microcystis aeruginosa. Barra Bonita Reservoir (SP, Brazil) conditions were simulated in the laboratory using the associated local bacterial community. The extent of degradation was quantified as the amount of organic carbon transferred from each DOM fraction (< 3 kDa and 3-30 kDa) to bacteria. The variation of bacteria morphotypes associated with the decomposition of each fraction was observed. To find the degradation rate constants (k(T)), the time profiles of the total, dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations were fitted to a first-order kinetic model. These rate constants were higher for the 3-30 kDa fraction than for the lighter fraction. Only in the latter fraction the formation of refractory dissolved organic carbon (DOCR) compounds could be detected and its rate of mass loss was low. The higher bacterial density was reached at 24 and 48 hours for small and higher fractions, respectively. In the first 48 hours of decomposition of both fractions, there was an early predominance of bacillus, succeeded by coccobacillus, vibrios and coccus, and from day 5 to 27, the bacterial density declined and there was greater evenness among the morphotypes. Both fractions of DOM were consumed rapidly, corroborating the hypothesis that DOM is readily available in the environment. This also suggests that the bacterial community in the inocula readily uses the labile part of the DOM, until this community is able to metabolise efficiently the remaining of DOM not degraded in the first moment. Given that M. aeruginosa blooms recur throughout the year in some eutrophic reservoirs, there is a constant supply of the same DOM which could maintain a consortium of bacterial morphotypes adapted to consuming this substrate.

J	Wu, J; Zhang, H; He, PJ; Shao, LM				Wu, Jun; Zhang, Hua; He, Pin-Jing; Shao, Li-Ming			Insight into the heavy metal binding potential of dissolved organic matter in MSW leachate using EEM quenching combined with PARAFAC analysis	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in heavy metal migration from municipal solid waste (MSW) to aquatic environments via the leachate pathway. In this study, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) quenching combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis was adopted to characterize the binding properties of four heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd) and DOM in MSW leachate. Nine leachate samples were collected from various stages of MSW management, including collection, transportation, incineration, landfill and subsequent leachate treatment. Three humic-like components and one protein-like component were identified in the MSW-derived DOM by PARAFAC. Significant differences in quenching effects were observed between components and metal ions, and a relatively consistent trend in metal quenching curves was observed among various leachate samples. Among the four heavy metals, Cu(II) titration led to fluorescence quenching of all four PARAFAC-derived components. Additionally, strong quenching effects were only observed in protein-like and fulvic acid (FA)-like components with the addition of Pb(II), which suggested that these fractions are mainly responsible for Pb(II) binding in MSW-derived DOM. Moreover, the significant quenching effects of the FA-like component by the four heavy metals revealed that the FA-like fraction in MSW-derived DOM plays an important role in heavy metal speciation; therefore, it may be useful as an indicator to assess the potential ability of heavy metal binding and migration.

J	Cozzi, S; Cantoni, C				Cozzi, Stefano; Cantoni, Carolina			Stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) composition of particulate organic matter, nutrients and dissolved organic matter during spring ice retreat at Terra Nova Bay	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Concentration and isotope composition of particulate organic matter were analysed from five coastal sites on the annual fast ice and in the underlying water column at Terra Nova Bay. The highest increases of POC (< 2767 mu M C) and PON (< 420 mu M N) were reached in bottom ice and the unconsolidated platelet layer, linked with a large accumulation of nutrients and dissolved organic matter. Isotope POM composition in ice habitats was highly varied (delta C-13(POC): -30.7 to -15.0 parts per thousand, delta N-15(PON): 1.8-9.9 parts per thousand). Constant negative delta C-13(POC) (> -29.3 parts per thousand) and positive delta N-15(PON) (< 9.4 parts per thousand) values characterized the upper ice horizons, indicating the prevalence of aged detritus in these assemblages. By contrast, isotope composition (delta C-13(POC): -15.0 to -29.7 parts per thousand, delta N-15(PON): 1.8-9.6 parts per thousand) and POC/PON ratios (6.2-12.6) changed markedly in bottom ice and interstitial water, even on short time scales, because of the combined effects of internal growth and mixing among freshly produced biomass. Sea ice breakout caused a large settling of particulates in the water column. It changed delta C-13(POC) (from 7.9 to 1.8 parts per thousand) and delta N-15(PON) (7.9-1.8 parts per thousand) values in suspended particulate matter, indicating that inputs from fast ice strongly affect the isotopic signature of the particulate assemblage Antarctic coastal waters.

Results showed that dissolved organic carbon concentration, ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen, and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm were in the range of 0.383-3.502 g kg(-1), 0.388-3.693 and 2.700-4.629 L mg(-1) m(-1), respectively, indicating the stability of MSW. Results obtained from Fourier transform infrared spectra have demonstrated that the stability of excavated MSW was characterized by disappearance of some easily biodegradable compounds; and the 1635/1406 ratio varied from 0.979 to 1.840 and was higher than that of the matured compost. The excitation-emission matrix spectra have shown that the principal components in excavated MSW comprised humic substances and the MSW was stable by the presence of a peak with wavelength pair of similar to 280/420 nm.

J	Kiikkila, O; Kitunen, V; Smolander, A				Kiikkila, Oili; Kitunen, Veikko; Smolander, Aino			Properties of dissolved organic matter derived from silver birch and Norway spruce stands: Degradability combined with chemical characteristics	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from the humus layer under silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.), and mixed stands, and from senescent birch leaves and from spruce needles of the four oldest year-growth were characterized microbiologically and chemically. Samples were collected in the autumn and the solutions were obtained by centrifugation-drainage technique. The degradability of DOM, the availability of DOM to bacteria and fungi, concentrations of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates, and the distribution of carbon and nitrogen into fractions according to the chemical nature and the molecular size were studied. DOM derived from leaves and needles was clearly more labile than DOM derived from the humus layer indicating the importance of studying the DOM originating from fresh litter when assessing the turnover of DOM. DOM derived from spruce needles appeared to differ chemically greatly from all other samples. It had very high concentrations of carbohydrates, probably due to the sampling time, and phenolic compounds. The chemical composition of DOM derived from humus layer did not reflect the composition of DOM derived from needles and leaves. DOM derived from birch leaves degraded more than DOM derived from spruce needles and DOM derived from humus layer collected at the birch sites degraded more than DOM derived from humus layer collected at the spruce sites. The degradability of different compound groups of DOC and DON was studied in a short-term incubation (20 d) of DOM solutions by characterizing the solutions initially and after the incubation. Almost all compound groups appeared to degrade but weak hydrophobic acids, bases, hydrophilic neutrals, the smallest molecular size compounds, carbohydrates, and phenolic compounds degraded the most.

Fluorescence analysis provided a 'fingerprint' technique to trace the mixing of DOM between three tributaries in the upstream of Minjiang River. The nearly constant concentration and composition in the main stream of Minjiang River reflected the effect of dam construction. Correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that humic-like components were principally derived from flushing of watershed soils, while protein-like component was formed from in-situ production which could be used as a proxy of the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). Multi-linear regression of fluorescent components C2 and C3 can be used to trace the variation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration.

Impact of dissolved organic matter on colloid transport in the vadose zone: Deterministic approximation of transport deposition coefficients from polymeric coating characteristics	WATER RESEARCH												Although numerous studies have been conducted to discern colloid transport and stability processes, the mechanistic understanding of how dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects colloid fate in unsaturated soils (i.e., the vadose zone) remains unclear. This study aims to bridge the gap between the physicochemical responses of colloid complexes and porous media interfaces to solution chemistry, and the effect these changes have on colloid transport and fate. Measurements of adsorbed layer thickness, density, and charge of DOM-colloid complexes and transport experiments with tandem internal process visualization were conducted for key constituents of DOM, humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), at acidic, neutral and basic pH and two CaCl(2) concentrations. Polymeric characteristics reveal that, of the two tested DOM constituents, only HA electrosterically stabilizes colloids. This stabilization is highly dependent on solution pH which controls DOM polymer adsorption affinity, and on the presence of Ca(+2) which promotes charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging. Transport experiments indicate that HA improved colloid transport significantly, while FA only marginally affected transport despite having a large effect on particle charge. A transport model with deposition and pore-exclusion parameters fit experimental breakthrough curves well. Trends in deposition coefficients are correlated to the changes in colloid surface potential for bare colloids, but must include adsorbed layer thickness and density for sterically stabilized colloids. Additionally, internal process observations with bright field microscopy reveal that, under optimal conditions for retention, experiments with FA or no DOM promoted colloid retention at solid-water interfaces, while experiments with HA enhanced colloid retention at air-water interfaces, presumably due to partitioning of HA at the air-water interface and/or increased hydrophobic characteristics of HA-colloid complexes.

Characterization of dissolved organic matter across the Subtropical Convergence off the South Island, New Zealand	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated along a gradient across the Subtropical Convergence (STC) off the South Island, New Zealand. Ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), excitation emission matrix fluorescence (EEM) spectroscopy, and molecular lignin analysis techniques were used to study this DOM. The analysis revealed a group of compounds found only in the coastal DOM samples, which were also characterized by an elevated terrestrial DOM fluorescence pattern and elevated lignin content if compared to the offshore samples. This group exhibited a high degree of carbon unsaturation, as evident from high double bond equivalence minus oxygen values (DBE-O>9) and maximum fluorescence intensity. Sulfur-containing molecular formulae for summer DOM samples were much more abundant across the entire transect of the STC compared to winter and exhibited distinctly different hydrogen:carbon and oxygen:carbon elemental ratios, suggesting a possible correlation between biological activity and sulfur compounds. The molecular formulae common to all STC samples were compared with those calculated for DOM extracted from freshwater collected from a stream discharging into Doubtful Sound (West Coast, New Zealand). ESI-FT-ICR-MS measurements undertaken in negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) mode indicated that 30% of the molecular formulae were present in both types of DOM, while in positive ESI mode (ESI+) over 90% of the formulae were present in all samples. Hence, a significant portion of the molecular formulae assigned to the solid-phase extractable DOM pool (SPE-DOM) appear to be identical in oceanic and freshwater samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The distribution of DOC mainly controlled by the hydrography since the relationship between DOC and salinity was significant in both East China Sea. The biological activity had a significant influence on the concentration of DOC with a close correlation between DOC and Chl a. The absorption coefficient of CDOM (a355) decreased with the salinity increasing in the shelf of East China Sea (R-2=0.9045). CDOM and DOC were significantly correlated in ECS where DOC distribution was dominated largely by the Changjiang diluted water. Based on the relationship of CDOM and DOC, we estimated the DOC concentration of the surface in ECS from satellite-derived CDOM images.

J	Shimotori, K; Watanabe, K; Hama, T				Shimotori, Koichi; Watanabe, Keiji; Hama, Takeo			Fluorescence characteristics of humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter produced by various taxa of marine bacteria	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												An experimental study was conducted to assess the difference in humic-like fluorescence characteristics (excitation/emission = 290 to 360 /370 to 460 nm) of dissolved organic matter produced by bacteria isolated from coastal seawater. Ten bacterial strains were isolated, and 1 additional strain was obtained from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms. The strains' nearest phylogenetic neighbors were identified using 16S rRNA gene analysis. Eleven bacterial strains were inoculated in experimental liquid medium and incubated for 7 d. In this incubation experiment, the excitation-emission matrixes of the culture media were analyzed to elucidate the production of humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) between Day 0 and Day 7 of the incubation. The production of humic-like FDOM was found in 8 of the 11 culture media, with a total of 14 humic-like fluorescence peaks detected. Of these peaks, 10 exhibited different fluorescence characteristics. These findings indicate that the fluorescence characteristics of bacterialderived humic-like FDOM differed among the bacterial groups. Several cultures of bacterial strains contained FDOM, with peaks occurring in the spectral region often associated with humic-like material of terrestrial origin. One bacterial strain showed productivity of humic-like FDOM that was 1 order of magnitude higher than most of the bacterial strains. This result implies that the relative importance of humic-like FDOM production is different among bacterial genera in the ocean.																	0948-3055						2011	65	3					249	260		10.3354/ame01552						WOS:000301222500004

DOM was collected from a station in Dona Paula Bay, on the west coast of India, and fractionated into HMW and LMW portions. Each size fraction was inoculated with a natural population of bacteria and incubated over a period of 15 d at room temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C); during this period, sub-samples were removed and the following were measured: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved carbohydrate (TDCHO), free monosaccharide (MCHO), dissolved uronic acid (DURA), delta(13)C, bacterial abundance (BA), and bacterial production (BP). The LMW fraction was isotopically heavier (delta(13)C = -23.7 to -21.7 parts per thousand) than the HMW fraction (delta(13)C = -27.0 to -26.2 parts per thousand), and the initial TDCHO content of these fractions was 25 and 16%, respectively. The initial DURA content was similar in the LMW DOM (7.4% DOC) and the HMW DOM (7.0% DOC). BA and BP were consistently higher in the LMW DOM than in the HMW DOM. In 15 d incubation, greater proportions of DOC (35%), TDCHO (76%) and DURA (36%) were utilized in the LMW DOM than in the HMW DOM. This suggests that the LMW DOM was more biologically reactive, i.e. it was utilized more rapidly, than the HMW DOM. It appears that the bioreactivity and origin of the DOM strongly influenced its utilization by natural heterotrophic bacteria.																	0948-3055						2011	64	3					299	309		10.3354/ame01529						WOS:000296265000008

DOM characteristics in three anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactors (A/O-MBRs) and their correlations with membrane fouling were studied by using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence technology. The fluorescent protein-like substances were present in the samples of all stages of the A/O-MBR processes and in the samples of membrane foulants. Due to the different biochemical environments, the fluorescent characteristics of DOM in the anoxic and the oxic zones were very diverse. The fluorescence intensity (FI) of protein-like substances in DOM of the anoxic zones was higher than that of the oxic zones. Meanwhile, the FT of protein-like substances in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances (TB-EPS) exhibited strong negative correlations with membrane fouling. In addition, protein, fulvic acid and carbohydrate were proved to be the key substances in dissolved membrane foulants in restaurant wastewater treatment processes.

Effect of phosphates on dissolved organic matter release from peat-muck soils	INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS												The impact of phosphates on organic matter release from peat-muck soils was shown. Peat-muck samples were described among others by Water adsorption index, content of amino acids, bulk density, pH, and ash. On the base of obtained data, studied samples were characterized in terms of variable surface charge and possible changes in surface properties of humic acids which might have been under phosphates influence. Nature of studied humic acids were defined by elemental analysis. The release of dissolved organic matter from calcium forms of the humic acids was significantly affected by concentration of added salt. Generally, an increase in concentration of phosphates resulted in increasing of humic substances released to the solution up to 0.025 mol dm(-3) of the added salt. At very low, initial phosphate concentration, the secondary coagulation of dissolved organic matter was observed. Potentiometric titration curves of humic acid solutions without addition of phosphate ions showed that studied organic matter was differentiated in relation to variable surface charge. However, titration curves of humic acids with additions of different phosphates concentrations were identical what could indicate that under experiment conditions, phosphates did not influence on structure of humic acid surface.																	0236-8722						2011	25	2					173	180								WOS:000290697700010

Source, biogeochemical cycling, and fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter in an agro-urban estuary	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence characteristics were combined with weekly to bi-weekly measurements of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) (including particulate, dissolved organic and inorganic forms) and chlorophyll to determine how riverine inputs and autochthonous production influence DOM and nutrient dynamics in the Swan-Canning estuary, Western Australia. Estuarine concentrations of C, N, and P were influenced by multiple factors, including the seasonal riverine flux of DOM, N, and P, the regeneration of mainly inorganic N and P from benthic anoxia, and the delivery of DOM and nutrients from urban drains. Parallel factor analysis of excitation-emission matrices identified eight fluorescence components that were used to fingerprint three distinct sources of estuarine DOM: (1) riverine DOM derived mainly from vascular plant material, (2) autochthonous DOM recently produced within the estuary (indicated by tryptophan-like fluorescence), and (3) autochthonous DOM originating from within the lower estuary or coastal marine environment enriched in marine humic-like and tyrosine-like fluorescence. Overall, fluorescence DOM characteristics shifted from humic-like in the upper and mid-estuary to protein-like in the lower estuary, which likely reflects the increased contribution of autochthonous relative to terrigenous DOM closer to the estuary mouth. Our findings show that DOM composition varies with season and estuary position as riverine DOM inputs, mainly from terrestrial plant material, are supplemented by autochthonous DOM contributions associated with discrete inputs of inorganic nutrients.

Although DOM is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, it represents only a small proportion of the total organic matter in soil. However, DOM, being the most mobile and actively cycling organic matter fraction, influences a spectrum of biogeochemical processes in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Biological fixation of atmospheric CO2 during photosynthesis by higher plants is the primary driver of global carbon cycle. A major portion of the carbon in organic matter in the aquatic environment is derived from the transport of carbon produced in the terrestrial environment. However, much of the terrestrially produced DOM is consumed by microbes, photo degraded, or adsorbed in soils and sediments as it passes to the ocean. The majority of DOM in terrestrial and aquatic environments is ultimately returned to atmosphere as CO2 through microbial respiration, thereby renewing the atmospheric CO2 reserve for photosynthesis. Dissolved organic matter plays a significant role in influencing the dynamics and interactions of nutrients and contaminants in soils and microbial functions, thereby serving as a sensitive indicator of shifts in ecological processes. This chapter aims to highlight knowledge on the production of DOM in soils under different management regimes, identify its sources and sinks, and integrate its dynamics with various soil processes. Understanding the significance of DOM in soil processes can enhance development of strategies to mitigate DOM-induced environmental impacts. This review encourages greater interactions between terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemists and ecologists, which is essential for unraveling the fundamental biogeochemical processes involved in the synthesis of DOM in terrestrial ecosystem, its subsequent transport to aquatic ecosystem, and its role in environmental sustainability, buffering of nutrients and pollutants (metal(loid)s and organics), and the net effect on the global carbon cycle.

Composition of dissolved organic matter within a lacustrine environment	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Freshwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of chemical components that are central to many environmental processes, including carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, questions remain as to its chemical characteristics, sources and transformation mechanisms. Here, we employ 1- and 2-D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the structural components of lacustrine DOM from Ireland, and how it varies within a lake system, as well as to assess potential sources. Major components found, such as carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) are consistent with those recently identified in marine and freshwater DOM. Lignin-type markers and protein/peptides were identified and vary spatially. Phenylalanine was detected in lake areas influenced by agriculture, whereas it is not detectable where zebra mussels are prominent. The presence of peptidoglycan, lipoproteins, large polymeric carbohydrates and proteinaceous material supports the substantial contribution of material derived from microorganisms. Evidence is provided that peptidoglycan and silicate species may in part originate from soil microbes.

Competitive Adsorption of Dissolved Organic Matter by Carbon Nanotubes and Activated Carbon in Aqueous Phase	ADVANCES IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING	Advances in Biomedical Engineering				International Conference on Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering	FEB 20-21, 2011	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA					Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT-1030) and Activated carbon (AC) were employed as adsorbents to study the competitive adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on three types of surface water representing urban runoff, agricultural drainage, forest stream in Guangzhou. The adsorption on humic acid solution was also examined for referred purpose. Characteristic changes of DOM in the experiments were assessed by measuring UV absorbance, fluorescence excitation emission matrix, spectroscopy (EEMs) and dissolved organic carbon concentration. Results of our experiments showed that surface water in Guangzhou contained significant levels of aromatic protein II (indicating by Ex200-250/Em330-380), fulvic acid-like, soluble microbial byproduct-like. Both SWNT and MWNT-1030 had greater adsorption capacity than AC. SWNT and MWNT-1030 reduced 40% and 14% UV(254) when compared to AC, respectively. CNTs selectively adsorbed DOM in aromatic protein II, fulvic acid-like, and humic acid-like DOM, whereas soluble microbial byproduct-like DOM was not affected in the experiments. The adsorption dynamics of DOM on CNTs was best described with pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.979 on average.																	2160-0589		978-0-9831693-9-0				2011							361	364								WOS:000289665600094

The results indicate that degradation of EEDs followed a pseudo-first-order. Photosensitised transformation of EEDs occurred because of the light absorption of DOM under sunlight irradiation while distinctive retardation effects were observed under UV/TiO2 irradiation, which is related to the structure and concentration of DOM. These results reported here have significance not only to the design of a practical photocatalysed oxidation system, but also to the selection of a feasible and effective wastewater treatment technique.																	0957-4352	1741-5101					2011	45	1-3					69	80								WOS:000288536500007		
J	Wada, S; Suzuki, S				Wada, S.; Suzuki, S.			Inhibitory effect of zinc on the remineralisation of dissolved organic matter in the coastal environment	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												To understand the role of zinc (Zn) in the biogeochemical cycle in coastal environments, we examined the bacterial remineralisation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with 2 composite experiments using microcosms supplemented with Zn. In Expt 1, using samples collected from 2 stations in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, we found that a decrease in DOM due to bacterial remineralisation during a 14 d experimental period had negative responses to Zn at both sites, but we found an inhibitory effect on bacterial abundance only at a station in the western part of the Seto Inland Sea. In Expt 2, comparison of the response of the remineralisation process to Zn among 3 kinds of organic substrate showed that Zn has little effect on 2 authentic standards (laminarin and bovine serum albumin) and that remineralisation of DOM originating from natural seawater was significantly suppressed by the addition of Zn. Based on the regression curves, we estimated the potential impact of Zn on the remineralisation of DOM. At a water quality standard of Zn concentration (86 mu g Zn l(-1)), DOM concentrations at the end of the experimental period (Day 14) increased 2.4 to 6.9%, and turnover time prolonged with a timescale of weeks to months. These potential shifts induced by Zn suggest that the allochthonous input of Zn into the coastal environment leads to suppression of energy flow in the microbial loop and enhances transport of DOM from coastal to offshore areas.																	0948-3055	1616-1564					2011	63	1					47	59		10.3354/ame01481						WOS:000287818000005		
J	Brockmeyer, B; Spitzy, A				Brockmeyer, Berit; Spitzy, Alejandro			Effects of sugar cane monocultures on origin and characteristics of dissolved organic matter in the Manguaba lagoon in northeast Brazil	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Brazil has extensive sugar cane monocultures, which significantly alter hydrogeochemical material fluxes. We studied dissolved organic matter (OM) fluxes in the Manguaba lagoon-estuary system, which drains a sugar cane monoculture-dominated hinterland and discharges into the Atlantic coastal ocean. The OM fluxes into the lagoon originate from baseflow, field runoff and sugar cane factory effluents. In the study, dissolved organic carbon (DOG) concentration, delta C-13 DOG and UV absorbance were analysed along a freshwater-seawater salinity gradient that encompasses river (DOC 9-11 mg l(-) (1), delta C-13 -22.2 parts per thousand to -25.5 parts per thousand); lagoon (4-11 mg l(-1), -20.5 parts per thousand to -24.8 parts per thousand); estuary (3-9 mgl(-1), -22.6 parts per thousand to -25.3 parts per thousand) and coastal waters (1.64 mg l(-1), -21 parts per thousand) with different intra-seasonal runoff conditions. We used the carbon isotope data to quantify the sugar cane derived DOG. Where river water meets brackish lagoon water, substantial loss of DOG occurs during rainy conditions, when suspended sediment from eroded fields in the river is very high. During dry weather, at much lower suspension levels, DOG increases, however, presumably from addition of photolysed resuspended sedimentary OM. In the estuary, mixing of DOG is strictly conservative. Ca. 1/3 of riverine DOM discharged into the lagoon has a sugar cane source. Within the lagoon on avg. 20% of the bulk DOM is comprised of sugar cane DOM, whereas during heavy rainfall the amount increases to 31%, due to intensified drainage flow and soil erosion. In the estuary, 14-26% is of sugar cane origin. The sugar cane-derived component follows the mixing patterns of bulk DOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The absorption spectra of DOM from this polluted saline lake resembled that of DOM from other natural environments. The spatial distribution of absorption coefficients at 280 nm (a280) indicated that sewage discharge was the main source of CDOM in this lagoon. A notable seasonal variation of a280 was observed from spring of 2008 to spring of 2009, indicating the reduction in sewage discharge from municipal works. Most values of spectral slope ratio (SR) of CDOM absorption were >1, implying that sewage-derived DOM has a low molecular weight. There was a significant linear correlation between a280 and the DOC concentration, demonstrating the feasibility to use optical properties of DOM to assess the degree of organic pollution in highly-polluted aquatic environments.

Ferric chloride (FeCl3) and Polyaluminium Chloride (PAC) were employed in the coagulation process. The results showed that both FeCl3 and PAC were effective for remove Turbidity and TP, the removal efficiency were all above 90% when the dosages was reasonable; optimal removal efficiency of COD were appropriate of 60-70%; but the removal efficiency of NH4+-N and TN were 10-20% only. The comparison results of removal efficiency of COD, Turbidity, NH4+-N, TN and TP in different concentration of raw wastewater with the same dosages of FeCl3 and PAC were also investigated. The results showed that water quality of raw wastewater was one of the influential parameters for the optimized treatment of the wastewater. The MW distribution of DOM of the raw wastewater and coagulated samples was analysis by gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and ultrafiltration technology. Compared with the initial wastewater, coagulated samples had much narrower distributions of MW. DOM fraction MW>30kDa can be removed by both FeCl3 and PAC. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The initial fractionation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Baltic Sea ice was studied through two freezing experiments and by sampling natural sea ice. DOM was characterized by the spectral absorption of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and the parallel factor analysis of DOM fluorescence. Molecular weight measurements of DOM were applied to assess changes in the molecular size distribution of DOM in new sea ice relative to parent sea water. Both in the newly formed artificial and the natural sea ice, CDOM was enriched by 34-39% relative to salinity. The same three identified DOM fluorophores were present both in sea water and ice but enriched by 15-54% relative to salinity in ice. After the incorporation of DOM into ice, the ageing of ice decreased the spectral slope coefficient and the molecular weight of DOM. This study shows that physical processes during freezing of brackish water enrich chromo- and fluorophoric DOM relative to salts in sea ice.																	0260-3055	1727-5644					2011	52	57	2				233	241								WOS:000289655800008

Betaproteobacteria growth and nitrification rates during long-term natural dissolved organic matter decomposition experiments	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												As a first attempt to relate net nitrification rates with bacterial community structure in the coastal embayment of the Ria de Vigo (NW Spain), a set of 6 long-term (lasting 53 to 74 d) dissolved organic matter decomposition experiments were conducted in the dark and at a constant temperature of 15 degrees C with surface seawater collected in January, February, April, and June 2008. Net nitrification rates were estimated from nitrate concentration changes. Evolution of bacterial community composition was followed using catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescent in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and specific probes for 6 relevant bacterial groups, including Beta-and Gammaproteobacteria. The growth rates of Betaproteobacteria showed a significant linear positive relationship with nitrification rates that explained 82% of the observed variability, which strongly suggests that the main nitrifying microorganisms during the incubations belonged to the Beta subclass of Proteobacteria. A positive relationship was found between net nitrification rates and both ammonium (r(2) = 0.92) and phosphate (r(2) = 0.97) concentrations, which suggests a tight link among the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, likely as a result of the role of phosphate as the bacterial growth-limiting nutrient.

J	Vazquez, E; Amalfitano, S; Fazi, S; Butturini, A				Vazquez, Eusebi; Amalfitano, Stefano; Fazi, Stefano; Butturini, Andrea			Dissolved organic matter composition in a fragmented Mediterranean fluvial system under severe drought conditions	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												In Mediterranean regions, drought is one of the main factors shaping fluvial ecosystems. Droughts cause a shift from lotic to lentic conditions, triggering a gradual fragmentation of the longitudinal hydrological continuum, and a severe alteration of water chemical properties. However, within a biogeochemical perspective, little is known about how and to which extend droughts modify the chemical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, the variability of DOM properties along a fragmented fluvial system is explored, during a summer severe drought, by means of (a) the ratio between dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations (DOC:DON); (b) DOC bioavailability (BDOC) and (c) DOM optical properties (SUVA index, fluorescence index, and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices). DOM and water measurements were collected from isolated water parcels that became disconnected from the fluvial continuum at different times, and were compared with data obtained in the following autumn, when the fluvial continuum was re-established. Analysis of DOM chemical properties evidenced that these properties during drought clearly differed from those observed in autumn, but changes did not follow an arbitrary pattern. Thus, the sampling sites with lotic water bodies showed DOM properties similar to those observed in autumn reflecting the dominance of terrestrial inputs. But, once hydrological fragmentation occurred, there was a gradual increase in the contribution of autochthonous DOM as the time elapsed since the pools were established, and the geochemical conditions shifted from oxidized to reduced conditions. In consequence, the fragmentation of fluvial continuum generates a set of distinct biochemical hot spots (i.e., each water parcel), revealing that extreme drought greatly amplifies the qualitative heterogeneity of organic matter in a fluvial system.

J	Benner, R; Kaiser, K				Benner, Ronald; Kaiser, Karl			Biological and photochemical transformations of amino acids and lignin phenols in riverine dissolved organic matter	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The photo- and bio-degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water from the Broad River were investigated in laboratory experiments using a solar simulator to control the intensity and exposure of samples to irradiation. The water samples included a natural assemblage of microorganisms, and the daily exposure of samples to irradiation was varied to distinguish the relative contributions of photochemical and biological degradation. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and specific components of DOM, including chromophoric DOM (CDOM), lignin phenols and amino acids, were monitored to investigate the reactivity and predominant pathway of degradation of these DOM components. Biodegradation was primarily responsible for the overall remineralization of DOC and losses of the amino acid component of DOM, whereas photodegradation was primarily responsible for losses of the chromophoric and lignin phenol components of DOM. The rates of photodegradation of lignin phenols were strongly influenced by the presence of methoxy groups on the aryl ring. Syringyl (S) phenols have two methoxy substitutions, vanillyl (V) phenols have one methoxy substitution, and p-hydroxy (P) phenols are not substituted with methoxy groups. Photochemical decay constants were highest for S phenols, lowest for P phenols and followed a consistent pattern (S > V > P) in the experiments. The carbon-normalized yields of amino acids and lignin phenols were found to be useful molecular indicators of the highly reactive (i.e. labile) components of biodegradable and photodegradable DOM, respectively.

Proposed attempts to return the Everglades to more natural flow conditions will result in changes to the present transport of DOM from the Everglades Agricultural Area and the northern conservation areas to Florida Bay. In part, the restoration plan calls for increasing water flow throughout the Everglades by removing some of the manmade barriers to flow in place today. The land- and water-use practices associated with the plan will likely result in changes in the quality, quantity, and reactivity of DOM throughout the greater Everglades ecosystem. The authors discuss the factors controlling DOM concentrations and chemistry, present distribution of DOM throughout the Everglades, the potential effects of DOM on key water-quality issues, and the potential utility of dissolved organic matter as an indicator of success of restoration efforts.

J	Hur, J; Lee, TH; Lee, BM				Hur, Jin; Lee, Tae-Hwan; Lee, Bo-Mi			Estimating the removal efficiency of refractory dissolved organic matter in wastewater treatment plants using a fluorescence technique	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												The spectroscopic characteristics and relative distribution of refractory dissolved organic matter (R-DOM) in sewage have been investigated using the influent and the effluent samples collected from 15 large-scale biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Correlation between the characteristics of the influent and the final removal efficiency was also examined. Enhancement of specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and a higher R-DOM distribution ratio were observed for the effluent DOM compared with the influent DOM. However, the use of conventional rather than advanced biological treatments did not appear to affect either the effluent DOM or the removal efficiency, and there was no statistical significant difference between the two. No consistent trend was observed in the changes in the synchronous fluorescence spectra of the DOM after biological treatment. Irrespective of the treatment option, the removal efficiency of DOM was greater when the influent DOM had a lower SUVA, reduced DOC-normalized humic substance-like fluorescence, and a lower R-DOM distribution. These results suggest that selected characteristics of the influent may provide an indication of DOM removal efficiency in WWTPs. For R-DOM removal efficiency, however, similar characteristics of the influent did not show a negative relationship, and even exhibited a slight positive correlation, suggesting that the presence of refractory organic carbon structures in the influent sewage may stimulate microbial activity and inhibit the production of R-DOM during biological treatment.																	0959-3330						2011	32	16					1843	1850		10.1080/09593330.2011.565078						WOS:000300178500002

They are key issues to understand the biogeochemical processes in the aquatic environments. Typically, FDOM undergoes photochemical transformation and is recalcitrant to microbial degradation, except for the aromatic amino acids that are microbiologically degraded under dark conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity of various FDOM components is depleted upon irradiation (in the hours to 70 days time scale), approximately by 20-85% for fulvic acid, by 12-95% for fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) or commercial detergents, and by 5-60% for trytophan. Microbial degradation is able to decompose the amino acid tryptophan and similar compounds, by approximately 13-24% in unfiltered river waters, 67% in unfiltered sewerage samples, and 11% in filtered river samples. The photoreactivity of FDOM is greatly decreased when passing from freshwater (river and lakes) to marine waters, but deep waters in lakes or marine environments are often more sensitive to photodegradation processes than surface waters. The high reactivity of FDOM toward photodegradation could be understood on the basis of its (however complex) chemical structure, considering that many FDOM components can undergo photoionization or otherwise photosensitized oxidation under sunlight. The controlling factors to the photochemical and microbial degradation of FDOM for a variety of waters are extensively discussed. One of the important functions of FDOM is the formation of complexes with transition metals in the aquatic environments, and this review discusses the mechanisms by which FDOM interacts with metals. Further investigations on FDOM, namely the identification of still unknown FDOM components, the metal-FDOM interactions as well as the photochemical and microbial reactivity will give invaluable information on the DOM dynamics in the aquatic environments.

The interaction between DOM and HOPs minimizes the bioavailability of HOPs and their potential health effects. In addition, DOM is also the precursor of disinfection by-products. It is very important to understand the relationship between free and bound HOPs and DOM in drinking water. This chapter will explore the binding phenomenon between HOPs and DOM in raw and treated water from water treatment plants. This chapter introduces the analytical methodologies for characterizing DOM and the hazardous potential of HOPs and thus understanding their relationship. Initial studies have been completed and showed that monitoring both the free and bound forms of HOPs as well as disinfection by-products (such as trihalomethanes) and their relationship to DOM during drinking water treatment processes is necessary to better understand drinking water quality.																	0097-6156		978-0-8412-2634-0				2011	1086						61	77								WOS:000313023300005

Removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from raw water by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in raw water is a precursor for the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during chlorination at a water treatment plant in southern Taiwan. The presence of DOM also has a large impact on the behavior of nanoparticles. The adsorption kinetics of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was investigated in the presence of DOM as a possible technique for the pretreatment of DBP precursors. pH, ionic strength and temperature are major factors in adsorption tests. Experimental results indicated that adsorption reached equilibrium after 120 min. Additionally, the adsorption capacity of SWCNTs increased with an increasing DOM concentration and decreased with an increasing ionic strength. The optimum adsorption model out of a selection including the Modified Freundlich equation, the Pseudo-first-order equation and Pesudo-second order equation, was the Modified Freundlich equation model. The intraparticle diffusion equation model was also examined. The adsorption process was controlled by pore diffusion that was confirmed by the fits of intra-particle diffusion model. The maximum adsorption capacity was 26.1-20.8 mg/g at 4 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Isotherm adsorption results demonstrated that the adsorption of DOM onto SWCNTs was favorable at a high initial DOM concentration and at low ionic strength, pH and temperature. These findings highlighted the importance of pretreatments and the presence of DOM on the adsorption behavior of nanomaterials.																	1093-4529						2011	46	12					1357	1365		10.1080/10934529.2011.606688						WOS:000297550900006	21942388

In this study, the influence of DOM from different sources (DOMR, DOMS and DOMH, extracted from rice straw, compost and humic soil respectively) on mercury reduction was investigated. The molecular weight distribution and chemical composition of DOM from each source were determined using ultrafiltration membrane technique and elemental analysis respectively. The result showed that mercury release from DOM-added samples was much lower than the control; the lowest mercury release flux was observed in the treatment of DOMH, 25.02% of the control, followed by DOMS and DOMR, 62.46% and 64.95% of the control, respectively. The higher saturation degree and lower molecular weight of DOMH was responsible for the highest inhibition degree on the mercury release. The link between DOMH, concentration and mercury flux was also estimated and the result showed that mercury flux was increased with DOMH at lower concentration, while decreased with DOMH at higher concentration. Different mechanism dominated the influence of DOM on mercury release with variation of DOM concentration.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2011	23	6					912	917		10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60497-4						WOS:000292120200005	22066213

Batch experiments were conducted under various adsorbent dosages, pH, contact time, temperatures and DOM fractional characteristics. Under the optimum conditions of fly ash dosage of 15 g/L, temperature of 303 K and contact time of 180 min, a removal of 22.5% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 23.7% of UV-254, 25.9% of the trihalomethanes precursors in secondary effluent was obtained. The adsorption of DOM fractions onto fly ash all followed the pseudo second-order kinetic model, and the hydrophilic fraction adsorption by fly ash also fitted the intraparticle diffusion model quite well. Freundlich and Langmuir models were applicable to the fly ash adsorption and their constants were evaluated. The maximum adsorption capacities of the adsorptions revealed that fly ash was more effective in adsorbing hydrophilic fraction than the acidic fractions. Structure changes of the DOM fractions after fly ash adsorption were also characterized via spectrum analyzing. Those mechanisms presented critical step toward improved efficiencies of fly ash adsorption via further surface-modification.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2011	23	7					1057	1065		10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60597-9						WOS:000293201900001	22125896

Experiments to investigate aerobic biodegradation of leachate DOM were carried out using untreated and treated leachate samples collected from two UK municipal solid waste landfills, L1 and L2. Leachate samples collected at different stages of the aerobic treatment processes were characterized by conventional methods (chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved organic carbon content (DOC)) and also by UV spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. The laboratory-scale aerobic treatment system achieved reductions in COD and DOC in all of the leachates. Results obtained from UV spectrophotometry indicated that the aromatic character of the leachate decreased during aerobic biodegradation. Additionally, the fluorescence intensity of the leachates decreased to various extents, suggesting degradation of humic, fulvic or protein-like structures during biodegradation. Initial results showed strong relations between fluorescent DOC and fluorescent COD and suggest that the strength of these correlations could be a useful tool in distinguishing sources and biodegradability of DOC cheaply and quickly, although further research using different types of leachates is required.																	2220-1319						2011	1	2					78	87		10.2166/wrd.2011.032						WOS:000209030800002

The coagulation process was operated with 20 mg/L polyaluminum chloride (PACl) at pH 7. The MF used had a pore size of 0.1 mu m and the UF was of immersible polysulfone hollow fiber membrane with a pore size of 0.008 mu m. The hybrid coagulation-UF process could effectively reduce DOM in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV-254 by 64% whereas the hybrid MF-UF membrane process yielded lower efficiency, 58% DOC reduction and 50% UV-254, respectively. In regards to trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) analysis, the hybrid coagulation-UF membrane process showed slightly higher efficiency in THMFP reduction than that of the hybrid MF-UF process, 87.6 and 87.1%, respectively. The resin adsorption technique using DAX-8 was also employed to fractionate DOM in all water samples into two fractions; hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophillic (HPI) organic matter. Significantly, HPO was the major fraction of DOM in the raw water source and it was the main precursor of THMFP.																	0003-7214						2011	60	8					494	501		10.2166/aqua.2011.001						WOS:000298411500004

Potential uptake of dissolved organic matter by seagrasses and macroalgae	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) acts as a large reservoir of fixed nitrogen. Whereas DON utilization is common in the microbial community, little is known about utilization by macrophytes. We investigated the ability of the coexisting temperate marine macrophytes Zostera noltii, Cymodocea nodosa, and Caulerpa prolifera to take up nitrogen and carbon from small organic substrates of different molecular complexities (urea, glycine, L-leucine, and L-phenylalanine) and from dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from algal and bacterial cultures (substrates with a complex composition). In addition to inorganic nitrogen, nitrogen from small organic substrates could be taken up in significant amounts by all macrophytes. Substrate uptake by the aboveground tissue differed from that of the belowground tissue. No relationships between carbon and nitrogen uptake of small organics were found. The preference for individual organic substrates was related to their structural complexity and C:N ratio. Uptake of algae-derived organic nitrogen was of similar magnitude as inorganic nitrogen, and was preferred over bacteria-derived nitrogen. These results add to the growing evidence that direct or quick indirect DON utilization may be more widespread among aquatic macrophytes than traditionally thought.

The photochemical transformation of DOM increased the biomass and the production of heterotrophic bacteria, flagellates, and ciliates in the following 10 d bioassay. The succession of heterotrophic plankton indicated a 3-level trophic transfer of photoproduced bioavailable DOM through bacteria and flagellates to ciliates. The photochemical transformation of DOM also stimulated the biomass and the production of phytoplankton through the photoproduction of bioavailable N initially incorporated into bacterial biomass. The grazing of bacterioplankton supplied N to phytoplankton directly, presumably due to mixotrophy, and indirectly by releasing dissolved N. The carbon stable isotope signature of plankton biomass was similar to that of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the photochemical transformations concerned primarily terrestrial DOM and therefore represented a microbial link between terrestrial DOM and planktonic production. The bacterial production stimulated by the photochemically produced labile DOM was related to the number of photons absorbed during the photochemical transformation of DOM for the determination of apparent quantum yield. According to the apparent quantum yield, the calculated summertime photoproduction of labile substrates contributes 2 to 5% to total bacterial production in the northern Baltic Sea. According to this study, the photochemical transformation of terrestrial DOM influences not only the initial production of bacterioplankton but can also stimulate higher trophic levels and autotrophic plankton in coastal waters.																	0171-8630						2011	423						1	14		10.3354/meps09010						WOS:000287965900001

Chemosynthetic origin of C-14-depleted dissolved organic matter in a ridge-flank hydrothermal system	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Hydrothermal fluids circulate through extensive areas of the upper oceanic crust. Most hydrothermal circulation occurs on ridge flanks(1,2), where low-temperature fluids flow through porous basalts. These fluids contain variable levels of dissolved organic carbon, but the source and composition of this carbon are uncertain. Here, we report Delta C-14 and delta C-13 measurements of dissolved organic carbon in ridge-flank and on-axis hydrothermal fluids sampled from the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Dissolved organic carbon from two independent ridge-flank sites was characterized by low delta C-13 and Delta C-14 values. The delta C-13 values ranged from -26 to -35 parts per thousand, and were consistent with a chemoautotrophic origin. The C-14 ages of the dissolved organic carbon ranged from 11,800 to 14,400 years before present, revealing that the carbon was around three times older than dissolved organics in the deep ocean. The Delta C-14 values of the ridge-flank dissolved organic matter also corresponded closely to those of dissolved inorganic carbon in the same fluid samples. Taken together, the data suggest that chemosynthetic crustal microbial communities synthesize dissolved organic carbon from inorganic carbon in ridge-flank fluids. We suggest that ridge-flank circulation may support an indigenous biosphere extensive enough to export substantial fixed carbon, with distinct isotopic and probably compositional character, to the overlying ocean.

Removal of inorganic mercury and methylmercury from surface waters following coagulation of dissolved organic matter with metal-based salts	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The presence of inorganic mercury (IHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in surface waters is a health concern worldwide. This study assessed the removal potential use of metal-based coagulants as a means to remove both dissolved IHg and MeHg from natural waters and provides information regarding the importance of Hg associations with the dissolved organic matter (DOM) fraction and metal hydroxides. Previous research indicated coagulants were not effective at removing Hg from solution; however these studies used high concentrations of Hg and did not reflect naturally occurring concentrations of Hg. In this study, water collected from an agricultural drain in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta was filtered to isolate the dissolved organic matter (DOM) fraction. The DOM was then treated with a range of coagulant doses to determine the efficacy of removing all forms of Hg from solution. Three industrial-grade coagulants were tested: ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, and polyaluminum chloride. Coagulation removed up to 85% of DOM from solution. In the absence of DOM, all three coagulants released IHg into solution, however in the presence of DOM the coagulants removed up to 97% of IHg and 80% of MeHg. Results suggest that the removal of Hg is mediated by DOM-coagulant interactions. There was a preferential association of IHg with the more aromatic, higher molecular weight fraction of DOM but no such relationship was found for MeHg. This study offers new fundamental insights regarding large-scale removal of Hg at environmentally relevant regarding large-scale removal of Hg at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Based on the fieldworks of water qualities experiments at Taihu lake, China, on 27 and 28 October, 2003, the present paper used the Landsat/TM imageries to study and estimate the distribution pattern of CDOM concentration at Taihu lake. According to the study results, it was found that CDOM was a strong absorber at TM1 band, where there was a wave trough at that corresponding wavelength. Taking the reflectance at TM1 as a remote sensing parameter, the remote sensing technology could perfectly retrieval the CDOM concentration from the Landsat/TM imagery at TM1 band. Compared with the validation dataset at two stations, the mean bias between modeled prediction and in situ measurements was 0. 922 mg . L(-1) and the corresponding relative bias was 14. 85%. Additionally, the retrieval results show that the spatial distribution of CDOM concentration was higher in the south and center of the lake, but lower in the east and west lake.																	1000-0593					JAN	2011	31	1					34	38		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2011)01-0034-05						WOS:000286290900008

J	Labanowski, J; Feuillade, G				Labanowski, Jerome; Feuillade, Genevieve			Dissolved organic matter: Precautions for the study of hydrophilic substances using XAD resins	WATER RESEARCH												This study concerns the possible changes in the repartition and the molecular characteristics of hydrophilic substances (HyS) isolated by XAD resins from the same source of organic matter as a function of the distribution coefficient k' and the DOM concentration. We tested that on two different sources of organic matter (a surface water and a landfill leachate). Breakthrough curves column experiments highlighted a modification of the repartition between hydrophilic and humic substances according to the k' value applied. But, we find that the composition of HyS is significantly modified between k' = 50 and 100. Our observations tend to suggest a higher contribution of humic-like matter (high-molecular weight aromatic compounds) with an increase of the k' value. This results in a shift of fluorescence bands to longer wavelengths and changing patterns of the SEC profiles and molecular fingerprints performed by flash pyrolysis. Our results show that DOM concentration also influences the composition of HyS while little effect is observed on their quantification at k' = 50 or 100. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

There are distinctive chemical characteristics associated with DOM origins. Australian sourced DOM had higher hydrophobic acid (HoA) content and exhibited a more pronounced humic character, indicating a higher influence from allochthonous organics (decayed plant bodies from vegetated catchments). The higher content of hydrophobic base and neutral components found in Chinese DOM, may be attributed to the effects of increasing pollution caused by the rapid urbanization in China. The molecular weights (MWs) of aquatic HoA are predominantly in the moderate (e.g. 1-10 kDa) or small (e.g. <1 kDa) ranges. This suggests that aquatic HoA should not be assumed as high MW organics without experimental validation. It is also found that some of the low MW compounds in our samples were hydrophobic, which could explain the observation of low MW organic compounds being able to be removed by conventional treatment processes.				wei, qunshan/A-2352-2012; CAS, KLUEH/G-8978-2016	wei, qunshan/0000-0002-5484-4087; 												0273-1223						2011	64	1					171	177		10.2166/wst.2011.432						WOS:000293070600023	22053472

In our study, seven water samples collected from Wuliangsuhai Lake in Inner Mongolia were used. UV-visible spectra and synchronous fluorescence spectra were applied to investigate the humification degree and aromatic structure of dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from water samples. The results showed that both samples from W1 site and W3 site display lower humification degree and less aromatic structure, where industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and reclaimed water of farmland irrigation, were accepted respectively. After computing the values of SUVA(254), A(280), A(250/365), A(253/203) and A(226-400), we reached the conclusion that they have a consistent trend (W4> W6> W5> W2> W7> W1> W3). Fluorescence index (f(450/500)) was always utilised to interpret the origin of organic matter in a complex aquatic environment system. Values of f(450/500) are closer to 1.60, indicating that humic substances derived from terrestrial sources and biological sources. Our study demonstrated that reclaimed water of farmland irrigation, industrial wastewater and domestic sewage will definitely influence the humification degree and amount of the aromatic structure of DOM.

J	Hakala, JA; Chin, YP				Hakala, Jacqueline Alexandra; Chin, Yu-Ping			Abiotic Reduction of Pendimethalin and Trifluralin in Controlled and Natural Systems Containing Fe(II) and Dissolved Organic Matter	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												The environmental fate of dinitroaniline herbicides is poorly understood, despite their classification as Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxins by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This study investigated the abiotic reduction of pendimethalin and trifluralin in controlled laboratory systems in the presence of Fe(II) and fulvic acids isolated from various surface waters and in sediment pore waters containing naturally abundant levels of dissolved Fe(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM). It was found that Fe(II) was necessary for pendimethalin and trifluralin reduction to occur in controlled systems and that higher concentrations of DOM slowed Fe(II)-mediated reactions. Pendimethalin and trifluralin reduction in natural pore waters was roughly an order of magnitude slower compared to controlled Fe(II) DOM solutions, indicating that the reactive Fe(II) species responsible for reduction are concentration-limited in natural pore waters relative to controlled systems. The results show that caution must be exercised when extrapolating results from controlled system reactions to natural systems and that abiotic reduction of both trifluralin and pendimethalin is observed within 3-7 days in anaerobic sedimentary pore waters containing high concentrations of both dissolved Fe(II) and DOM.																	0021-8561					DEC 22	2010	58	24					12840	12846		10.1021/jf102814b						WOS:000285236400038	21087048

Kinetics of superoxide reactions with dissolved organic matter in tropical Atlantic surface waters near Cape Verde (TENATSO)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The decay kinetics of superoxide (O-2(-)) reacting with organic matter was examined in oligotrophic waters at, and nearby, the TENATSO ocean observatory adjacent to the Cape Verde archipelago. Superoxide is the short-lived primary photochemical product of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photolysis and also reacts with CDOM or trace metals (Cu, Fe) to form H2O2. In the present work we focused our investigations on reactions between CDOM and superoxide. O-2(-) decay kinetics experiments were performed by adding KO2 to diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) amended seawater and utilizing an established chemiluminescence technique for the detection of O-2 at nM levels. In Cape Verdean waters we found a significant reactivity of superoxide with CDOM with maximal rates adjacent to the chlorophyll maximum, presumably from production of new CDOM from bacteria/phytoplankton. This work highlights a poorly understood process which impacts on the biogeochemical cycling of CDOM and trace metals in the open ocean.

Measurement of Dissolved Organic Matter Fluorescence in Aquatic Environments: An Interlaboratory Comparison	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are often studied in order to infer DOM characteristics in aquatic environments, including source, quantity, composition, and behavior. While a potentially powerful technique, a single widely implemented standard method for correcting and presenting fluorescence measurements is lacking, leading to difficulties when comparing data collected by different research groups. This paper reports on a large-scale interlaboratory comparison in which natural samples and well-characterized fluorophores were analyzed in 20 laboratories in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. Shortcomings were evident in several areas, including data quality-assurance, the accuracy of spectral correction factors used to correct EEMs, and the treatment of optically dense samples. Data corrected by participants according to individual laboratory procedures were more variable than when corrected under a standard protocol. Wavelength dependency in measurement precision and accuracy were observed within and between instruments, even in corrected data. In an effort to reduce future occurrences of similar problems, algorithms for correcting and calibrating EEMs are described in detail, and MATLAB scripts for implementing the study's protocol are provided. Combined with the recent expansion of spectral fluorescence standards, this approach will serve to increase the intercomparability of DOM fluorescence studies.

Comparison between DAX-8 and C-18 solid phase extraction of rainwater dissolved organic matter	TALANTA												Rainwater is a very low concentrated matrix and, for dissolved organic matter (DOM) characterization, an efficient extraction procedure is essential. Isolation procedures based on the adsorption onto XAD-8 and C-18 sorbents have been used in the literature for rainwater DOM isolation, but a comparison between these procedures is lacking. In this work, UV-visible and molecular fluorescence spectroscopies highlighted differences between rainwater DOM isolated by DAX-8 (replacement for XAD-8) and by C-18. It was possible to recover higher rainwater DOM percentage by the C-18 based procedure than by the DAX-8 one. Rainwater protein-like compounds were better concentrated by the C-18 procedure than by the DAX-8 one, while humic-like compounds were similarly concentrated by both procedures. Furthermore, rainwater DOM extracted by the C-18 procedure was more representative of the global matrix, while DAX-8 preferentially extracted humic-like compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and pH on the abundance of 16S RDNA, nirK and nirS gene copies in four spruce forest sites. Soil samples for molecular based quantification (qPCR) were taken from the organic litter and humus layers. The amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN) were much lower in highly acidified soils. We found a strong correlation between nirK denitrifiers and the amount of available P (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), which suggested a higher nutrient sensitivity of this group of denitrifying bacteria. Additionally, we found that correlations between the amount of nirK denitrifiers and DOC and pH are exponentional showing two important threshold values, being 4.8 mol kg(-1) and 5, respectively. The amount of nirK denitrifiers rapidly decreased below these values. The amount of nirK and nirS denitrifiers was higher in the organic litter horizon than the organic humus horizon at all sampling sites.																	0168-2563					DEC	2010	101	1-3					123	132		10.1007/s10533-010-9430-9						WOS:000285096700010

The process involves the very fast reactions of the excited triplet state (3)AQ2S(star) and its 520-nm absorbing exciplex with water, at different time scales (ns and mu s, respectively). Quinones are ubiquitous components of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in surface waters and AQ2S was adopted here as a proxy of CDOM Using a recently developed model of surface-water photochemistry, we found that the oxidation of nitrite to NO2 by (CDOM star)-C-3 could be an important NO2 source in water bodies with high [NO2-] to [NO3-] ratio, for elevated values of column depth and NPOC.

Within the gneissic Valabres rockfall area in the southern French Alps, two sites, in the unstable massif and in the collapse area, were continuously monitored for electrical conductivity and for DOM natural fluorescence using a field fluorometer, and analyzed weekly for hydrochemical data. Two main results were found. From a methodological point of view, DOM natural fluorescence was a relevant tracer of fast infiltration in fissured media, knowing that continuous measurements improved the study of infiltration processes at the event time scale. From a hydrogeological point of view, the unstable fractured massif showed delayed dilution phenomena and the collapse areas showed fast and slow infiltration by piston-type flows via more or less open fractures. Consequently, from this conceptual model one may suppose that, unlike the collapse zones, the fractured hillslope threatening the valley is not submitted to strong pore-water pressure variations.

By using simplified least squares differentiation methods presented by Savitzky and Goly, the first-order partial derivatives for emission wavelength and excitation wavelength were calculated. As the fitting polynomial has the smoothing function in the calculation of derivative spectra, a separate smoothing method is not required to remove spectrometry noise. The regression model was calculated by partial least square for 4-dimension fluorescence data including emission wavelength, excitation wavelength and their first-order derivatives. The Experimental results for detecting total organic carbon (TOG) in water show that the proposed method has obvious advantage over the conventional fluorescence spectrometry analysis methods in the aspect of the root mean square error of prediction and correlation coefficient.																	1000-0593					DEC	2010	30	12					3268	3271		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)12-3268-04						WOS:000284987600023

The effects of redox condition were significant on 3DEEM fluorescence spectra of DOM, and in the aerobic condition, the peak intensities of protein-like fluorophores were both higher than those of the humic-like fluorophores, however, the phenomenon of the oxidative degradation of humic-original DOM could be seen. While in anaerobic condition, the peak intensities of the humic-like fluorescence were increased with increasing the incubation time. After the 21 day anaerobic incubation, the peak intensities of the humic-like fluorescence can be as 3. 51 and 3. 78 times higher than those of protein-like fluorescence. The differences in the DOM fluorescence parameters, e.g., peak intensities, locations and fluorescence index, indicate the difference in the chemical structures and various origins of the DOM in the overlying water between sediment-water interfaces.																	1000-0593					DEC	2010	30	12					3272	3276		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)12-3272-05						WOS:000284987600024

Based on the measured data of CDOM absorption coefficient in March 2009 in the north area of Yellow Sea, the present paper analyzed near ultraviolet absorption spectral properties of CDOM. The results showed that due to the impact of near-shore terrigenous input, the composition of CDOM is quite different in the north area of Yellow Sea, and this area is a typical case II water; fitted slope with specific range of spectral band and absorption coefficient at specific band can indicate the relative size of CDOM molecular weight, correlation between spectral slope of the S(g,275-300), S(g,300-350) S(g,350-400) and S(g,250-275) and the relative size of CDOM molecular weight indicative parameter M increases in turn and the highest is up to 0. 95. Correlation between a(g) (lambda) and M value increases gradually with the increase in wavelength, and the highest is up to 0. 92 at 400 nm; being correlated or not between spectral slope and absorption coefficient is decided by the fitting-band wavelength range for the spectra slope and the wavelength for absorption coefficient. Correlation between S(g,275-300) and a(g)(400) is the largest, up to 0.87.																	1000-0593					DEC	2010	30	12					3379	3383		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)12-3379-05						WOS:000284987600048

Three simulations are conducted: (1) the reference simulation based on Le Fouest et al. (2005), in which light attenuation by CDOM is not considered and maximum growth rate (mu(max)) of phytoplankton and zooplankton are not temperature-dependent (REF simulation); (2) light attenuation by CDOM is added to REF simulation (CDOM simulation); and (3) in addition to CDOM, the mu(max) of phytoplankton and zooplankton are regulated by temperature (CDOM + TEMP simulation). CDOM simulation shows that CDOM substantially reduces phytoplankton biomass and production in the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary (LSLE), but slightly reduces overall primary production in the GSL. In the LSLE, the spring phytoplankton bloom is delayed from mid-March to mid-April, resulted from light attenuation by CDOM. The CDOM + TEMP simulation shows that the spring phytoplankton bloom in the LSLE is further delayed to July, which is more consistent with observations. Annual primary production is reduced by 33% in CDOM + TEMP simulation from REF and CDOM simulations. Zooplankton production is the same in all three simulations, and export of organic matter to depth is reduced in CDOM + TEMP simulation, suggesting that temperature controlled growth of phytoplankton and zooplankton enhances the coupling between primary production and zooplankton production under the seasonal temperature cycle of the GSL.

J	Tian, L; Dell, E; Shi, W				Tian, Lei; Dell, Emily; Shi, Wei			Chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in agroecosystems: Correlations with soil enzyme activity and carbon and nitrogen mineralization	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Soil enzyme-catalyzed depolymerization of organic matter results in the production of low molecular weight and dissolved organic compounds. This fraction of soil organic matter is the immediate energy, carbon and other nutrient substrates for microbial catabolic pathways and thus likely plays an important role in soil processes. The purpose of this study was to elucidate interrelationships among dissolved organic matter, soil enzyme activity, and soil C and N mineralization from diverse agroecosystems. These systems included a conventional cropping, organic cropping, integrated crop-livestock, plantation forestry, and succession from an abandoned agricultural field. We collected surface soil samples from 0 to 10 cm depth in early spring 2009 and examined the concentrations of soil-derived dissolved organic C and N. soluble phenolics, reducing sugars, and amino acids, the activities of beta-glucosidase, exoglucanase, phenol oxidase, peroxidase, and beta-glucosaminidase, and the rates of soil C and N mineralization. The integrated crop-livestock system showed the highest concentrations of dissolved soil organic C (78 mu g C g(-1) soil) as well as phenolic compounds (1.5 mu g C g(-1) soil), reducing sugars (23 jig C g(-1) soil), and amino acids (0.76 mu g N g(-1) soil), and these components were up to 3-fold greater than soils under the other systems. However, soil beta-glucosidase activity in the integrated crop-livestock system was significantly lower than the other systems and appeared to reflect the inhibitory role of soluble phenolics on this enzyme; this enzymatic disparity was also revealed in our preliminary study conducted in 2008. Among the five enzyme activities examined, only peroxidase activity was correlated significantly with the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter as well as soil C and N mineralization. Soil peroxidase activity was negatively related to the relative abundance of reducing sugars (i.e., reducing sugar C as a fraction of dissolved organic C, r = -0.92, P<0.05) and positively with soil C and N mineralization (r = 0.86, P<0.1 for C mineralization; r = 0.85. P<0.1 for N mineralization). Furthermore, relative abundance of reducing sugars was negatively associated with soil C mineralization (r = -0.80, P<0.1) and so was relative abundance of amino acids with soil N mineralization (r = -0.97, P<0.01). Our results suggested that diverse agroecosystems differed in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter and the differences could be correlated with soil peroxidase activity and soil C and N mineralization.

The results show that ozone pre-oxidation enhanced the photobacteria acute toxicity of the water samples. DOM before and after ozone pre-oxidation was fractionated by resins into six kinds of hydrophobic and hydrophilic organics. The six fractions were chlorinated individually and the photobacteria acute toxicity before and after chlorination was tested. It was found that the percentage of hydrophilic organics in DOM significantly increased after ozone pre-oxidation and hydrophilic organics exhibited remarkably higher acute toxicity than hydrophobic organics. In view of potentiometric titration and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, the hydrophilic organics showed a rather higher content of ph-OH structures than hydrophobic organics.																	1674-7291					NOV	2010	53	11					2394	2398		10.1007/s11426-010-4040-x						WOS:000284078200027

During composting a reduction of carbohydrates and an increase of aromatic, phenolic, carboxylic and carbonylic C were observed. The highest increase in alkyl C and the lowest increase in aromatic C were explained by the presence of hardly degradable pine needles in the substrate, whereas the highest reduction in carbohydrates and the highest increase of the alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio were attributed to the presence of highly degradable materials such as spent yeast from beer production.

J	Hulatt, CJ; Thomas, DN				Hulatt, Chris J.; Thomas, David N.			Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in microalgal photobioreactors: A potential loss in solar energy conversion?	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY												Microalgae are considered to be a potential alternative to terrestrial crops for bio-energy production due to their relatively high productivity per unit area of land. In this work we examined the amount of dissolved organic matter exuded by algal cells cultured in photobioreactors, to examine whether a significant fraction of the photoassimilated biomass could potentially be lost from the harvestable biomass. We found that the mean maximum amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released measured 6.4% and 17.3% of the total organic carbon in cultures of Chlorella vulgaris and Dunaliella tertiolecta, respectively. This DOM in turn supported a significant growth of bacterial biomass, representing a further loss of the algal assimilated carbon. The release of these levels of DOC indicates that a significant fraction of the photosynthetically fixed organic matter could be lost into the surrounding water, suggesting that the actual biomass yield per hectare for industrial purposes could be somewhat less than expected. A simple and inexpensive optical technique, based on chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurements, to monitor such losses in commercial PBRs is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the environmental dynamics of DOM within wetlands have not been well documented on large spatial scales. To better assess DOM dynamics within large wetlands, we determined high resolution spatial distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM quality by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) in a subtropical freshwater wetland, the Everglades, Florida, USA. DOC concentrations decreased from north to south along the general water flow path and were linearly correlated with chloride concentration, a tracer of water derived from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), suggesting that agricultural activities are directly or indirectly a major source of DOM in the Everglades. The optical properties of DOM, however, also changed successively along the water flow path from high molecular weight, peat-soil and highly oxidized agricultural soil-derived DOM to the north, to lower molecular weight, biologically produced DOM to the south. These results suggest that even though DOC concentration seems to be distributed conservatively, DOM sources and diagenetic processing can be dynamic throughout wetland landscapes. As such, EEM-PARAFAC clearly revealed that humic-enriched DOM from the EAA is gradually replaced by microbial- and plant-derived DOM along the general water flow path, while additional humic-like contributions are added from marsh soils. Results presented here indicate that both hydrology and primary productivity are important drivers controlling DOM dynamics in large wetlands. The biogeochemical processes controlling the DOM composition are complex and merit further investigation.

Using Two-Dimensional Correlations of C-13 NMR and FTIR To Investigate Changes in the Chemical Composition of Dissolved Organic Matter along an Estuarine Transect	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Applying two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy to C-13 NMR and FTIR spectra of the high molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM) isolated along an Elizabeth River/Chesapeake Bay salinity transect shows that HMW-DOM consists of three major components that have different biogeochemical reactivities. The first appears to be a heteropolysaccharide (HPS) component and its contribution to carbon increases as we approach the marine offshore. The second appears to be composed of carboxyl-rich compounds (CRC); its carbon percentage decreases. The third component contains the major functional group of amide/amino sugar (AMS) and its carbon percentage stays almost constant along the salinity transect It seems that the HPS and CRC are present in many aquatic environments at different relative ratios. The 2D-correlation maps reveal that each of these components is composed of dynamic mixtures of compounds that share similar backbone structures but have significant functional group differences. Two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy is a powerful new biogeochemical tool to track the changes in complex organic matter as a function of space, time, or environmental effects.																	0013-936X					NOV 1	2010	44	21					8044	8049		10.1021/es100898x						WOS:000283484000014	20942450

Degradation of Ozone-Refractory Organic Phosphates in Wastewater by Ozone and Ozone/Hydrogen Peroxide (Peroxone): The Role of Ozone Consumption by Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Ozonation is very effective in eliminating micropollutants that react fast with ozone (k > 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)), but there are also ozone-refractory (k < 10 M(-1) s(-1)) micropollutants such as X-ray contrast media, organic phosphates, and others. Yet, they are degraded upon ozonation to some extent, and this is due to (center dot)OH radicals generated in the reaction of ozone with organic matter in wastewater (DOM, determined as DOC). The elimination of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and tris-2-chloroisopropyl phosphate (TCPP), added to wastewater in trace amounts, was studied as a function of the ozone dose and found to follow first-order kinetics. TnBP and TCPP concentrations are halved at ozone to DOC ratios of similar to 0.25 and similar to 1.0, respectively. The (center dot)OH rate constant of TCPP was estimated at (7 +/- 2) x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1) by pulse radiolysis. Addition of 1 mg H(2)O(2)/L for increasing the (center dot)OH yield had very little effect. This is due to the low rate of reaction of H(2)O(2) with ozone at wastewater conditions (pH 8) that competes unfavorably with the reaction of ozone with wastewater DOC. Simulations based on the reported (Nothe et al., ES&T 2009, 43, 5990-5995) (center dot)OH yield (13%) and (center dot)OH scavenger capacity of wastewater (3.2 x 10(4) (mgC/ L)(-1) s(-1)) confirm the experimental data. Based on a typically applied molar ratio of ozone and H(2)O(2) of 2, the contribution of H(2)O(2) addition on the (center dot)OH yield is shown to become important only at high ozone doses.

RESULTS: The characteristic behavior of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was examined for the stratum matrix configurations of both natural soil and a mixture of soil and FA. Incubation and fractionation experiments indicated that FA additive within the SAT columns would enhance the bulk adsorption of hydrophobic fractions, but decrease the biodegradation of the hydrophilic fraction simultaneously. The configuration design of an upper 0.25 m soil layer and a mixture of FA and soil underneath could make use of the functions of both FA adsorption and biodegradation within soil, which could lead to a further fractional removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). Moreover, FA additive in the SAT columns could result in a significant decrease of tryptophan-like aromatic proteins and fulvic-like components (C=C and C=O related), while the setting of the top 25 cm soil layer would lead to a further reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, FA might serve as a supplementary material for enhancing the reduction of DOM during SAT operation.

Fluorescence spectroscopy opens new windows into dissolved organic matter dynamics in freshwater ecosystems: A review	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The biochemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influences its biogeochemical role in freshwater ecosystems, yet DOM composition measurements are not routinely incorporated into ecological studies. To date, the majority of studies of freshwater ecosystems have relied on bulk analyses of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen to obtain information about DOM cycling. The problem with this approach is that the biogeochemical significance of DOM can only partially be elucidated using bulk analyses alone because bulk measures cannot detect most carbon and nitrogen transformations. Advances in fluorescence spectroscopy provide an alternative to traditional approaches for characterizing aquatic DOM, and allow for the rapid and precise characterization of DOM necessary to more comprehensively trace DOM dynamics. It is within this context that we discuss the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to provide a novel approach to tackling a long-standing problem: understanding the dynamics and biogeochemical role of DOM. We highlight the utility of fluorescence characterization of DOM and provide examples of the potential range of applications for incorporating DOM fluorescence into ecological studies in the hope that this rapidly evolving technique will further our understanding of the biogeochemical role of DOM in freshwater ecosystems.

We determined CDOM absorption, fluorescence, composition, and source in 38 lakes on the Yungui Plateau at altitudes of 1516 to 4591 m above sea level. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations significantly increased with increasing trophic state, and decreased with altitude. The CDOM absorption coefficient a(CDOM)(280) significantly increased with increasing trophic state, but not with altitude. There were significant and negative correlations between altitude and TN, TP, Chl a concentrations, and a(CDOM)(280). Parallel factor analysis identified two humic-like and two protein-like fluorescent components. Humic-like component 1 was terrestrially derived and positively correlated to CDOM absorption. Component 2 was similar to a marine humic-like substance originating from biological degradation of phytoplankton. Components 3 and 4 were autochthonous tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like fluorophores. CDOM was, thus, a mixture of material from the catchment and autochthonous material produced by biota in the lake. CDOM fluorescence characteristics of oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes were dominated by the spectral signatures of protein-like components, but marine and terrestrial humic-like components dominated in eutrophic lakes. The fluorescence indices FI(255), FI(310), and FI(370) were useful tools for readily defining and classifying CDOM characteristics in the Yungui Plateau lake waters.

Influence of bedrock geology on dissolved organic matter quality in stream water	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												A field study was conducted to determine the linkage between dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and bedrock geology. Sediment and water samples were collected from six streams, three flowing over sandstone and three flowing over limestone bedrock in the Bankhead National Forest, Alabama. Various stream water and sediment characteristics were determined by standard limnological methods and DOM quality was determined by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with sample introduction by electrospray ionization (ESI FT-ICR MS). Stream waters from limestone streams showed higher concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium, sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon, as well as higher pH and acid neutralizing capacity, and were enriched in condensed hydrocarbons. In contrast, stream waters from sandstone streams showed higher concentrations of aluminum and iron and were enriched in tannin-like compounds. ESI FT-ICR MS analysis indicated that stream water DOM consisted of between 2950 and 3700 individual compounds ranging from 250 to 1000 Dalton. DOM compounds were grouped into 35 heteroatom (NnOoSs) classes based on molecular formula assignments and multivariate statistical analysis was applied to reveal the patterns of variation of the DOM quality and identify environmental parameters associated with the variation. Partial redundancy analysis indicated that the variation in stream water DOM quality correlated with stream location and water chemistry parameters associated with bedrock type. A similar analysis including three previously published ESI FT-ICR MS analyses of stream water DOM showed similar correlations with location and stream water chemistry, indicating that bedrock geology via stream water chemistry influences DOM quality.

J	Wang, R; Wang, WX				Wang, Rui; Wang, Wen-Xiong			Importance of Speciation in Understanding Mercury Bioaccumulation in Tilapia Controlled by Salinity and Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We explored the roles of mercury speciation on the bioaccumulation (both aqueous and dietary uptake and elimination) of inorganic mercury (Hg[II]) and methylmercury (MeHg) in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) by controlling the mercury binding to inorganic and organic ligands. For the aqueous uptake, we showed that the uptake rates of Hg(II) were significantly higher at 0 psu compared with those at 10 psu and 28 psu. Based on the mercury-Cl complexes distribution, we found a positive relationship between the Hg(II) aqueous uptake rate and the abundance of neutral HgCl2. Such relationship was further confirmed by the uptake experiments conducted over a lower salinity range (0-6 psu), suggesting that HgCl20 was the predominant species taken up by tilapia. In the presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from different sources (Suwannee River and natural local waters), mercury uptake rates all decreased dramatically over a wide range of salinity, especially for Hg(II), indicating the overwhelming influence of DOC as opposed to the single effect of salinity. Using the mercury-Cl-DOC model, we demonstrated for the first time that the inhibition of DOC was dependent on the Cl-, which was less significant at middle salinity level for both mercury forms. In contrast to the complex influence of water conditions on dissolved uptake, we found no significant influence of acclimated salinity on the dietary assimilation and elimination of both mercury species in tilapia. Our results demonstrated the importance of speciation in understanding the mercury bioaccumulation in various natural systems and its broad biogeochemical cycling.

The experimental results showed that there was no precipitation production during the titrating process, and the complexation ratios between Hg(II) and the fluorescence group in DOMs were nearly 1:1; the conditional stability constants and the percentage of fluorophores participating in the complexation between Hg(II) and protein-like matter with different ages were 4. 3 - 5. 7 and 54. 1% - 92. 3%, respectively, while those between Hg(II) and fulvic-like matter with different ages were 4. 35 - 4. 98 and 35. 8% - 60. 1%, respectively. The complexation ability between Hg(II) and fulvic-like matter decreases with the increase of landfill time, though the percentage of fluorophores participating in the complexation increased. Besides, the complexation process was easily affected by the pH value, especially under the acidity or alkality circumstance.																	0253-3820					OCT	2010	38	10					1417	1422		10.3724/SP.J.1096.2010.01417						WOS:000283904400007

Multivariate Statistical Approaches for the Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter Analyzed by Ultrahigh Resolution Mass Spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We apply multivariate statistics to explore the large data sets encountered from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectra of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Molecular formula assignments for the individual constituents of DOM are examined by hierarchal cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), to measure the relationships between numerous DOM samples. We compare two approaches: (1) using averages of elemental ratios and double bond equivalents calculated from the formulas, and (2) employing individual formulas and either their presence/absence or relative magnitude in each sample. With approach 2, PCA deciphers which of the thousands of formulas are significant to particular samples, and then a van Krevelen diagram highlights what types of compounds are molecular signatures to the samples. Our dual approach, especially approach 2, allows for complex data sets to be more easily interpreted, aiding in the characterization of DOM from various sources. By applying this methodology, clear trends can be delineated, trends that are not apparent from currently employed methods. Terrestrial DOM contains various lignin-derived compounds, tannins, and condensed aromatics. Marine DOM contains aliphatic compounds with heteroatom functionalities, as well as lignin-like molecules.

J	Nguyen, HVM; Hur, J; Shin, HS				Nguyen, Hang Vo-Minh; Hur, Jin; Shin, Hyun-Sang			Changes in Spectroscopic and Molecular Weight Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Matter in a River During a Storm Event	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics were investigated during a storm event in the Kyungan River using UV-visible, fluorescence spectroscopy, resin fractionation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Water samples were collected at nine sampling times to reflect a variation of the river water level. A dramatic increase was observed for chemical oxygen demand (COD) versus biochemical oxygen demand, suggesting that non-biodegradable organic components may be more contained in the organic matters driven by the storm. Specific UV absorbance values increased from 2.15 to 3.16 L/mgC-m, reaching the maximum level at the highest water level. The storm runoff resulted in the reduction of protein-like fluorescence (PLF), the increase of fulvic-like and humic-like fluorescence for the synchronous fluorescence spectra of DOM. Weight-average molecular weight (MW(w)) values increased from 1,100 to 1,510 Da due to the increment of high MW fractions in the SEC chromatograms. Overall changes in DOM composition may be explained by the inflow of soil-derived DOM from the upstream basins brought by the storm. The humification index (HIX) exhibited a positive correlation with MW(w) values, suggesting that HIX may be suggested to a prediction descriptor for DOM MW during the storm event. PLF presented a negative correlation with DOM MW, suggesting that protein-like fluorescent compounds are associated with low MW components in the river. More input of humic substances by the storm runoff appears to shift DOM into a higher MW value as revealed by a positive correlation between MW(w) and hydrophobic fraction.																	0049-6979					OCT	2010	212	1-4					395	406		10.1007/s11270-010-0353-9						WOS:000281983900034

Microbial community transcriptomes reveal microbes and metabolic pathways associated with dissolved organic matter turnover in the sea	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains as much carbon as the Earth's atmosphere, and represents a critical component of the global carbon cycle. To better define microbial processes and activities associated with marine DOM cycling, we analyzed genomic and transcriptional responses of microbial communities to high-molecular-weight DOM (HMWDOM) addition. The cell density in the unamended control remained constant, with very few transcript categories exhibiting significant differences over time. In contrast, the DOM-amended microcosm doubled in cell numbers over 27 h, and a variety of HMWDOM-stimulated transcripts from different taxa were observed at all time points measured relative to the control. Transcripts significantly enriched in the HMWDOM treatment included those associated with two-component sensor systems, phosphate and nitrogen assimilation, chemotaxis, and motility. Transcripts from Idiomarina and Alteromonas spp., the most highly represented taxa at the early time points, included those encoding TonB-associated transporters, nitrogen assimilation genes, fatty acid catabolism genes, and TCA cycle enzymes. At the final time point, Methylophaga rRNA and non-rRNA transcripts dominated the HMWDOM-amended microcosm, and included gene transcripts associated with both assimilatory and dissimilatory single-carbon compound utilization. The data indicated specific resource partitioning of DOM by different bacterial species, which results in a temporal succession of taxa, metabolic pathways, and chemical transformations associated with HMWDOM turnover. These findings suggest that coordinated, cooperative activities of a variety of bacterial "specialists" may be critical in the cycling of marine DOM, emphasizing the importance of microbial community dynamics in the global carbon cycle.

Source water controls on the character and origin of dissolved organic matter in streams of the Yukon River basin, Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate warming and permafrost degradation at high latitudes will likely impact watershed hydrology, and consequently, alter the concentration and character of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in northern rivers. We examined seasonal variation of DOC chemistry in 16 streams of the Yukon River basin, Alaska. Our primary objective was to evaluate the relationship between source water (shallow versus deep groundwater flow paths) and DOC chemical composition. Using base cation chemistry and principal component analysis, we observed high contributions of deep groundwater to glacial and clearwater streams, whereas blackwater streams received larger contributions from shallow groundwater sources. DOC concentration and specific ultraviolet absorbance peaked during spring snowmelt in all streams, and were consistently higher in blackwater streams than in glacial and clearwater streams. The hydrophobic acid fraction of DOC dominated across all streams and seasons, comprising between 35% and 56% of total DOC. The hydrophilic acid fraction of DOC was more prominent in glacial (23% +/- 3%) and clearwater streams (19% +/- 1%) than in blackwater streams (16% +/- 1%), and was enriched during winter base flow (29% +/- 1%) relative to snowmelt and summer base flow. We observed that an increase in the contribution of deep groundwater to streamflow resulted in decreased DOC concentration, aromaticity, and DOC-to-dissolved organic nitrogen ratio, and an increase in the proportion of hydrophilic acids relative to hydrophobic acids. Our findings suggest that future permafrost degradation and higher contributions of groundwater to streamflow may result in a higher fraction of labile DOM in streams of the Yukon basin.																	0148-0227					SEP 17	2010	115								G03025	10.1029/2009JG001153						WOS:000282013200001

As anions and cations in soil solution affect SC, the sorption properties can also be modified by electrolytes. This issue is particularly important in alkaline soils. In order to describe the effect of electrolyte type on SC properties and DOM sorption we comparatively investigated in column and batch experiments the release and retention behaviors of DOM of a Vertisol from the Nile River Delta. As electrolytes we have chosen NaCl, Na(2)SO(4), and CaCl(2), which are commonly found in soil solution. CaSO(4) was included to investigate the effect of gypsum application to the soil on the tested factors. The SC of the clay fraction was quantified at the initial soil pH of 8.3 at electrolyte concentrations of 0-10 mmol(c) l(-1) and a DOM application between 0 and 25 mg DOC l(-1). The kind of anion had strong effects on SC of the clay fraction. At 10 mmol(c) L(-1) the SC was -2.6 and -4.1 mmol(c) kg(-1) for NaCl and Na(2)SO(4), respectively. Strong negative SC at presence of Na(2)SO(4) led to repulsive forces, which hindered the sorption of DOM on clay particles and induced high DOM release in column experiments. At 10 mmol(c) L(-1) concentration of CaCl(2) and CaSO(4), the values of SC were -0.9 and -0.7 mmol(c) kg(-1), respectively, indicating that Ca(2+) is much stronger adsorbed than Sai under the alkaline conditions. In the DOM-clay system, most negative SC values were obtained in deionized water as compared to the electrolyte solutions, indicating that in the absence of electrolytes the strongest repulsive forces hindered the sorption of DOM on clay particles. The sorbed amounts of DOM on fine soil were large not only for both CaCl(2) and CaSO(4) electrolytes, but also for NaCl electrolyte with almost the same values. The fact that NaCl increased DOM sorption can be explained by soluble Ca(2+) and ion exchange as distinct amounts of Ca(2+) were released during percolation from the sample which stabilize DOM by Ca(2+) bridging. Despite some negative impact of applied SW on stable aggregation and DOM leaching, for agricultural practice the application of CaSO(4) is superior to that of CaCl(2), since the former removes Na(+) more efficiently.

Attenuation of in situ UV radiation in Mackenzie Delta lakes with varying dissolved organic matter compositions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In 2004, ultraviolet-B (UVB) and ultraviolet-A (UVA) attenuation were measured in Mackenzie Delta lakes spanning gradients in water renewal rate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition. DOM compositions (ratio of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) to non-chromophoric DOM) in Delta lakes are complex, evolving seasonally via flooding, dilution, macrophyte production, photobleaching, and bacterial metabolism. Attenuation was more strongly related to CDOM absorption coefficients (a(330); UVB r(2) = 0.69, p < 0.0001; UVA r(2) = 0.58, p < 0.0001) than to DOC concentrations due to variable DOM compositions. Attenuation in one set of lakes was well related (linear models) to a330 and total suspended solids (UVB R(2) = 0.80, p < 0.0001; UVA R(2) = 0.81, p < 0.0001). When these models were applied to other Delta lakes, however, attenuation of UVB was overestimated in 17 of 19 cases and attenuation of UVA was overestimated in all 18 cases. This bias indicates that models are not transferrable among Delta lakes, and likely cannot be applied in other circumpolar delta lakes with similarly complex DOM compositions. Although attenuation is high in Delta lakes (KdUVB 17.1-33.4 m(-1); K(d)UVA 7.7-19.2 m(-1)), plankton and photoreactive solutes may be exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) because Delta lakes are shallow, UVB and UVA penetrate the top 19% and 31% of water columns, respectively, and day lengths are extended during open water. Thus, climate change effects on DOM compositions may significantly alter in situ UVR environments in circumpolar delta lakes.																	0043-1397					SEP 10	2010	46								W09516	10.1029/2009WR008747						WOS:000281758800004

Characterization of dissolved organic matter in fogwater by excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in fogwater samples collected in southeastern Louisiana and central-eastern China has been characterized using excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy. The goal of the study was to illustrate the utility of fluorescence for obtaining information on the large fraction of organic carbon in fogwaters (typically >40% by weight) that defies characterization in terms of specific chemical compounds without the difficulty inherent in obtaining sufficient fogwater volume to isolate DOM for assessment using other spectroscopic and chemical analyses. Based on the findings of previous studies using other characterization methods, it was anticipated that the unidentified organic carbon fraction would have characteristic peaks associated with humic substances and fluorescent amino acids. Both humic- and protein-like fluorophores were observed in the fogwater spectra and fluorescence-derived indices for the fogwater had similar values to those of soil and sediment porewater. Greater biological character was observed in samples with higher organic carbon concentrations. Fogwaters are shown to contain a mixture of terrestrially- and microbially-derived fluorescent organic material, which is expected to be derived from an array of different sources, such as suspended soil and dust particles, biogenic emissions and organic substances generated by atmospheric processes. The fluorescence results indicate that much of the unidentified organic carbon present in fogwater can be represented by humic-like and biologically-derived substances similar to those present in other aquatic systems, though it should be noted that fluorescent signatures representative of DOM produced by atmospheric processing of organic aerosols may be contributing to or masked by humic-like fluorophores.

Sources and ages of dissolved organic matter in peatland streams: evidence from chemistry mixture modelling and radiocarbon data	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Monitoring data over the period 1994-2007 were analysed for three streams (Cottage Hill Sike, CHS; Rough Sike, RS; Trout Beck, TB) draining blanket peat underlain by glacial clay and limestone-rich sub-strata at Moor House (Northern England). Dissolved organic carbon concentration, [DOC], showed complex relationships with both discharge and calcium concentration, [Ca]. A model based on [Ca] was constructed to simulate stream [DOC] by mixing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from shallow peat, quantified by measured [DOC] (15-30 mg l(-1)) in peat porewater, with DOM assumed to be present at a constant concentration (c. 5 mg l(-1)) in groundwater. A temperature-based adjustment to the measured porewater [DOC] was required to account for relatively low streamwater [DOC] during winter and spring. The fitted model reproduced short-term variation in streamwater [DOC] satisfactorily, in particular variability in RS and TB due to groundwater contributions. Streamwater DOM is largely derived from surface peat, which accounts for more than 96% of the total DOC flux in both RS and TB, and 100% in CHS. Model outputs were combined with streamwater and porewater (DOC)-C-14 data to estimate the C-14 contents, and thereby the ages, of DOM from peat and groundwater. The peat-derived DOM is 5 years old on average, with most of it very recently formed. The derived age of groundwater DOM (8,500 years) is comparable to the 4,000-7,000 years estimated from the (DOC)-C-14 of water extracts of clay underlying the peat, suggesting that the clay is the source of groundwater DOM.

The present study investigated the instream DOM release from POM, varying in size and chemical quality. We produced large and medium sized fine particulate organic matter (L-FPOM, 250-500 mu m; M-FPOM, 100-250 mu m) of defined quality by feeding five types of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) to shredding amphipods (Gammarus spp.). Microscopic observations showed that L-FPOM and M-FPOM mainly consisted of the fecal pellets of amphipods, and incompletely eaten plant fragments, respectively. DOM release experiments were conducted by exposing CPOM and M- and L-FPOM fractions in natural stream water over a two week period. For CPOM, the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by leaching was highest during the first 6 h (3.64-23.9 mg C g C(-1) h(-1)) and decreased rapidly afterwards. For M- and L-FPOM, the DOC release remained low during the entire study period (range: 0.008-0.15 mg C g C(-1) h(-1)). Two-way ANOVA revealed that the DOC release rate significantly differed with POM source and size fraction, both at day 1 and after a week of exposure. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant correlation of elemental contents and lignin content to DOC release rate after a week of exposure. Overall, the results indicated that DOC release rate of FPOM, on a carbon basis, is comparable to that of CPOM after leaching, while size and source of POM significantly affect DOC release rate.

Elimination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from paper mill effluent was studied using three treatment options, ion exchange resin (IER), granular activated carbon (GAC) and nanofiltration (NF). The removal efficiency was analysed based on hydrophobicity, molecular weight and fluorogenic origin of the DOM fractions. For IER, GAC and NF treatments, overall removal of dissolved organic carbon was 72%, 76% and 91%, respectively. Based on the hydrophobicity. all the three treatment methods majorly removed hydrophobic acid fractions (HPhoA). Further, IER acted on all fractions, 57% of HPhoA, 44% of transphilic acid and 18% of hydrophilics, substantiating that the removal is by both ion exchange and adsorption. Based on the molecular weight, IER and GAC treatments acted majorly on the high molecular weight fractions, whereas NF eliminated all molecular weight fractions. After GAC adsorption, some amount of humic hydrolysates and low molecular weight neutrals persisted in the effluent. After IER treatment, amount of low molecular weight compounds increased due to resin leaching. Qualitative analysis of fluorescence excitation emission matrices showed that the fulvic acid-like fluorophores were more recalcitrant among the various DOM fractions, considerable amount persisted after all the three treatment methods. Three treatment methods considerably differed in terms of removing different DOM fractions; however, a broad-spectrum process like NF would be needed to achieve the maximum elimination.

J	Kim, SJ; Kwon, JH				Kim, Su-Jin; Kwon, Jung-Hwan			Determination of Partition Coefficients for Selected PAHs between Water and Dissolved Organic Matter	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The fate and transport of highly hydrophobic chemicals are affected by the partitioning between water and dissolved organic carbon. Large variation in the partition coefficient (K(DOCw)) is often found, due to the selection of model organic matter or potential experimental artifacts. To investigate the roles of the type of organic matter on the partitioning of highly hydrophobic compounds, the partition coefficients of eight selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with 3-6 aromatic rings, were determined using a passive dosing/extraction method between water and model dissolved organic matter (humic acid, fulvic acid, sodium dodecyl sulfate micelle (SOS), and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin). Although the K(DOCw) values for 3-4 ring PAHs in this study were close to those reported in the literature, experimental KD(OCw) values between Aldrich humic acid (AHA) and water were higher than values reported in the literature for 5-6 ring PAHs. The K(DOCw), values were highest for AHA, followed by SDS and Suwannee river fulvic acid (SFA). The slopes of the linear regression between log K(DOCw) and log K(ow) were 1.23 (+/- 0.13), 0.82 (+/- 0.09), and 0.59 (+/- 0.13) for AHA, SDS, and SEA, respectively. The differences in the K(DOCw) values between AHA and the other organic matter (SDS, SFA, and CD) increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the PAHs, showing that the sorption of highly hydrophobic chemicals to the humic acid fraction may be important in the presence of mixed organic matter.

J	D'Amore, DV; Fellman, JB; Edwards, RT; Hood, E				D'Amore, David V.; Fellman, Jason B.; Edwards, Richard T.; Hood, Eran			Controls on dissolved organic matter concentrations in soils and streams from a forested wetland and sloping bog in southeast Alaska	ECOHYDROLOGY												Understanding the sources and removal mechanisms for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is critical to determining the importance of peatlands in influencing streamwater DOM concentrations. Soil saturation and soil temperature are the primary factors that influence DOM cycling in soils, but the relationships among these factors vary by soil type and climate. Despite the extent of peatlands that occur within Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) watersheds, there is little information describing how DOM storage and export patterns are related to soil saturation and temperature in the region. We measured soil water tables, soil temperatures and redox potential and compared these measurements to fluctuations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations in a forested wetland and sloping bog in southeast Alaska to address this key information gap. DOC concentrations ranged from 5 to 140 mg C l(-1) in wetland soils, 11 to 46 mg C l(-1) in streams, and varied greatly in response to changes in water table, redox potential and soil temperature. Similarly, DON concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 2.4 mg N l(-1) in wetland soils, 0.2 to 0.6 mg N l(-1) in streams and concentrations also reflected seasonal changes in physical measures. Depth to water table and soil temperature were significant factors related to the concentration of DOC in forested wetland soils and streams, while soil temperature was a significant factor that influenced stream DOC and DON concentrations. Comparing soil solution and stream DOM concentrations indicated that N is retained in bogs, while both dilution and biotic/abiotic retention mechanisms control DOM export in forested wetlands. The relationships among soil saturation, temperature and concentrations of DOC and DON provide preliminary models for estimating DOM fluxes from wetland soils in the CTR. Furthermore, these results can help calibrate regional watershed carbon flux models to predict the potential impacts of climate shifts and management activities on future wetland soil and stream DOM concentrations in CTR watersheds.

J	Zhou, JM; Chen, HL; Huang, WL				Zhou, Jiangmin; Chen, Hualin; Huang, Weilin			EFFECTS OF RICE STRAW-DERIVED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER ON PYRENE SORPTION BY SOIL	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The objectives of the present study were to elucidate the chemical and structural properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from aerobic decay of rice straw and to quantify the effect of the DOM on the sorption of pyrene on soil. The DOM samples were obtained from microcosms incubated at 0, 21, 63, and 180 d. The bulk DOM samples were fractionated to four fractions: hydrophilic matter (HIM), acid-insoluble matter (AIM), hydrophobic acid (HOA), and hydrophobic neutral (HON) fractions. The bulk DOM and the four DOM fractions were characterized for their elemental compositions and functionalities. The results showed that HIM had the highest H/C atomic ratios, whereas HOA and AIM had the lowest H/C, atomic ratios. These DOM samples were used as the background DOMs in the initial aqueous solutions for measuring sorption of pyrene on a paddy soil. The results indicated that, among the four DOM fractions, HOA, HON, and AIM significantly lowered the pyrene sorption coefficients, but HIM had little or no effect on the pyrene sorption by the soil. It appears that less polar AIM and HON had stronger binding affinities for pyrene in water, reducing the sorption coefficient for the soil, whereas more polar and less aromatic HIM had much weaker binding affinity for pyrene in water, causing little or no effect on the pyrene sorption by the soil. The present study showed that rice straw derived DOM may enhance desorption and transport of organic pollutants in soil water systems. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:1967-1975.

During a visible surface slick, MAA concentrations reached 290 mu g L(-1) in the SSM, which correlated with an increase in abundance of the dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum micans (>4000 cells mL(-1)) and covaried with low Ekman transport. High levels of colored dissolved organic material (CDOM) were also found in the SSM, and a prominent absorption shoulder between 300 and 340 nm was evident in the CDOM absorption spectra, indicative of MAAs in the dissolved fraction. Low CDOM slope ratios (S(CDOM)(275-295) : (350-400)) during the development of the surface slick suggest microbial production of CDOM, possibly exuded from the sudden proliferation in P. micans. In the absence of a well-defined SSM, higher S(CDOM)(275-295) : (350-400) ratios were found, suggesting photobleaching of CDOM at the surface. The particulate absorption spectra of MAAs (a(PMAA)(lambda)) were effective at absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation in a narrow spectral band between 310 and 350 nm. Since a(CDOM)(lambda) exhibits an exponential rise in absorption in the UV and was high in the SSM and the subsurface compared with a(PMAA)(lambda), CDOM would be the principal mechanism of UVA and B attenuation in the water column, providing an additional sunscreen to phytoplankton.

Evidence for the production of marine fluorescence dissolved organic matter in coastal environments and a possible mechanism for formation and dispersion	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A positive linear relationship between salinity and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) was observed on several occasions along the West Florida shelf at salinities greater than 36.5. This represents a departure from the typical inverse relationship between FDOM and salinity observed in most coastal regions caused by the mixing of riverine FDOM with clear oceanic water. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrices showed that the high-salinity, high-FDOM water had blue-shifted spectra characteristic of autochthonous, marine FDOM, with peak M concentrations eight times higher than previously reported for seawater. The blue-shifted fluorescence endmember at high salinity was clearly distinguishable from a photobleached FDOM endmember. A high-resolution time series collected in a shallow embayment with significant Gulf of Mexico influence supplemented cruise data and provided a possible mechanism for the formation of high-salinity, high-FDOM water. During a dry period of spring tides, high-salinity, high-FDOM water was exported at ebb tide and lower-salinity, low-FDOM water was imported during flood tide. During neap tide, FDOM and salinity demonstrated no evidence of either export or dilution from incoming seawater. After a significant rain event, a more typical inverse relationship between salinity and FDOM was observed. Production of FDOM-rich water in shallow embayments has not been observed previously. This is likely an important source of organic matter and dispersion of this material may explain observations of a high-salinity, high-FDOM water in adjacent coastal regions.

Results showed that the absorbance spectra of CDOM in rain samples decreased exponentially with wavelength. The absorbance coefficient at 300 nm [a(300)] ranged from 0. 27 to 3. 45 m(-1), which would be used as an index of CDOM abundance, and the mean value was 1. 08 m(-1). The content of earlier stage of precipitation events was higher than that of later stage of precipitation events, which implied that anthropogenic sources or atmospheric pollution or air mass types were important contributors to CDOM levels in precipitation. EEMs spectra showed 4 types of fluorescence signals (2 humic-like fluorescence peaks and 2 protein-like fluorescence peaks) in rainwater samples, and there were significant positive correlations of peak A with C and peak B with S, showing their same sources or some relationship of the two humic-like substance and the two protein-like substance. The strong positive correlations of the two humic-like fluorescence peaks with a(300), suggested that the chromophores responsible for absorbance might be the same as fluorophores responsible for fluorescence. Results showed that the presence of highly absorbing and fluorescing CDOM in rainwater is of significant importance in atmospheric chemistry and might play a previously unrecognized role in the wavelength dependent spectral attenuation of solar radiation by atmospheric waters.

We used parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate changes in the biochemical composition and lability of terrigenous DOM in three estuaries of coastal southeastern Alaska: 1) a watershed with high glacial coverage, 2) low glacial coverage, and 3) low glacial coverage and high wetland coverage. Laboratory BDOC incubations were conducted for each site by inoculating filtered river water with microbial inocula collected from four different salinities (0, 2, 10 and 25) along the estuarine transect. The percent BDOC for all three sites ranged from 22 to 44% for the 28-day incubations and was greatest in the estuary draining the highly glaciated watershed. Moreover, percent BDOC was greatest for river water samples inoculated with marine compared to freshwater bacteria suggesting marine bacterioplankton were able to utilize a larger fraction of the terrigenous DOM pool than riverine microbes. PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence EEMs showed non-conservative estuarine mixing behavior for DOM including removal at low salinities and addition at mid-high salinities for all three sites. For example, tyrosine-like fluorescence decreased dramatically between salinity values 0 and 0.5 and was undetectable by salinity 2 for all three estuaries. However. humic-like C4 (correlated with aliphatic carbon content) and tryptophan-like fluorescence increased non-conservatively during estuarine mixing, likely associated with an increase in bacterioplankton growth. These results indicate that terrigenous DOM, particularly from glacial runoff, is an important source of carbon and nutrients to near-shore coastal zones of southeast Alaska. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Particulate-dissolved transformations as a sink for semi-labile dissolved organic matter: Chemical characterization of high molecular weight dissolved and surface-active organic matter in seawater and in diatom cultures	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chemical characterizations of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW DOM) have shown that a compositionally well-defined family of acylated polysaccharides (APS) contributes a large fraction of DOM in the surface ocean. One process that might affect APS cycling is physical removal by aggregation. To investigate the importance of this mechanism, we compared the chemical composition and transparent exopolymer particle (TEP) abundances of seawater HMW DOM with surface-active organic matter (SAOM) that accumulates as standing sea surface foam during intense wind events. We further simulated the aggregation of SAOM using bubble-adsorption of HMW DOM isolated from laboratory cultures of the diatom Chaetoceros neogracile. H-1-NMR spectroscopy and molecular-level analysis of natural and laboratory-produced HMW DOM and SAOM show important contributions from polysaccharides, acetate, and aliphatic organic matter and similar yields and distributions of neutral sugars after hydrolysis. Microbial degradation of Chaetoceros neogracile DOM removes proteins and mannose-rich polysaccharides to produce HMW DOM with spectral and molecular-level characteristics that resemble seawater APS. These results imply that APS and hydrolysable sugars are resistant to microbial degradation over the time frame of our degradation experiment (40 days). As revealed by H-1-NMR spectroscopy and by the neutral monosaccharide data, there are important similarities in the composition of APS in HMW DOM and natural and laboratory-produced SAOM foamy material, rich in TEP. Although these samples are operationally classified in two distinct pools (dissolved vs. particulate) in seawater, they exhibit similar chemical and spectral characteristics. Finally. TEP concentration measurements in SAOM samples indicate that freshly-produced diatom DOM yields SAOM with TEP concentration similar to seawater and natural SAOM, but seven times higher than SAOM produced after bubble-adsorption of degraded BMW DOM.

Biogeochemical relationships between ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter and picoplankton activity in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We targeted the warm, subsurface waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) to investigate processes that are linked to the chemical composition and cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater. The apparent respiration of semi-labile DOC accounted for 27 +/- 18% of oxygen consumption in EMS mesopelagic and bathypelagic waters; this value is higher than that observed in the bathypelagic open ocean, so the chemical signals that accompany remineralization of DOC may thus be more pronounced in this region. Ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) collected from four deep basins at depths ranging from 2 to 4350 m exhibited bulk chemical ((1)H-NMR) and molecular level (amino acid and monosaccharide) abundances, composition, and spatial distribution that were similar to previous reports, except for a sample collected in the deep waters of the N. Aegean Sea that had been isolated for over a decade. The amino acid component of UDOM was tightly correlated with apparent oxygen utilization and prokaryotic activity, indicating its relationship with remineralization processes that occur over a large range of timescales. Principal component analyses of relative mole percentages of monomers revealed that oxygen consumption and prokaryotic activity were correlated with variability in amino acid distributions but not well correlated with monosaccharide distributions. Taken together, this study elucidates key relationships between the chemical composition of DOM and heterotrophic metabolism. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yamashita, Y; Cory, RM; Nishioka, J; Kuma, K; Tanoue, E; Jaffe, R				Yamashita, Youhei; Cory, Rose M.; Nishioka, Jun; Kuma, Kenshi; Tanoue, Eiichiro; Jaffe, Rudolf			Fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter in the deep waters of the Okhotsk Sea and the northwestern North Pacific Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM), a fraction of chromophoric DOM, is known to be produced in the deep ocean and is considered to be bio-refractory. However, the factors controlling fluorescence properties of DOM in the deep ocean are still not well understood. In this study, we determined the fluorescence properties of DOM in the deep waters of the Okhotsk Sea and the northwestern North Pacific Ocean using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). One protein-like, two humic-like components, and one uncertain component, which might be derived from a fluorometer artifact, were identified by EEM-PARAFAC. Fluorescence intensity levels of the protein-like component were highest in the surface waters, decreased with depth, but did not change systematically in the bathypelagic layer (1000 m - bottom). Fluorescence characteristics of the two humic-like components were similar to those traditionally defined as marine and terrestrial humiclike fluorophores. The fluorescence intensity levels of the two humic-like components were lowest in the surface waters, increased with depth in the mesopelagic layer (200 - 1000 m), and then slightly decreased with depth in the bathypelagic layer. The ratio of the two humic-like components remained in a relatively narrow range in the bathypelagic layer compared to that in the surface layer, suggesting a similar composition of humic-like fluorophores in the bathypelagic layer. In addition, the fluorescence intensities of the two humic-like components were linearly correlated to apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) in the bathypelagic layer, suggesting that both humic-like components are produced in situ as organic matter is oxidized biologically. These findings imply that optical characteristics of humic-like fluorophores once formed might not be altered further biologically or geochemically in the deep ocean. On the other hand, relationships of fluorescence intensities with AOU and Fe(III) solubility were different between the two humic-like components in the mesopelagic layer, suggesting different environmental dynamics and biogeochemical roles for the two humic-like components.

Diatom derived dissolved organic matter as a driver of bacterial productivity: The role of nutrient limitation	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Variable inorganic nutrient concentrations were used to generate silicate (Si) or nitrogen (N) limited conditions in cultures of the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) harvested in the nutrient limited phase of these cultures was added to a natural bacterial community. Enhanced bacterial abundance and bacterial production were observed, in comparison to un-supplemented controls, when Si-limited (Si-DOM) rather than N-limited (N-DOM) diatom derived DOM or inorganic nutrients was added. This indicates that the bacterial population was limited by organic rather than inorganic resources but only Si-DOM had sufficient lability to alleviate this. Within the bacterial assemblage, a notable increase in the proportion of gamma-Proteobacteria was evident on receipt of only Si-DOM. Assessment of the composition of the added DOM suggested that the observed dynamics were related to organic matter composition rather than molecular size as, within the Si- and N-DOM, the proportions of low and high molecular weight compounds were similar, but the polysaccharide and protein signatures were different.

Modeling the dynamics and export of dissolved organic matter in the Northeastern US continental shelf	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Continental shelves are believed to play a major role in carbon cycling due to their high productivity. To improve our understanding of carbon dynamics on continental margins, a dissolved organic matter (DOM) model was developed and imbedded within an existing coupled ocean circulation-biogeochemical model of the U.S. East coast. A model simulation with the DOM module was compared with the reference model (without the DOM module) to illustrate the role of DOM dynamics in coastal ocean biogeochemical cycling. Model results reveal that the progressive release of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the ocean's upper layer during summer increases the regenerated primary production by 30-300%, which, in turn, enhances the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production mainly from phytoplankton exudation in the upper layer and solubilization of particulate organic matter (POM) deeper in the water column. This analysis suggests that DOM is a necessary component for representing ecosystem functioning and organic fluxes in models because DOM (1) is a major organic pool directly related to primary production, (2) decouples partially the carbon and nitrogen cycles (through carbon excess uptake, POM solubilization and DOM mineralization) and (3) is intimately linked to the residence time of water masses for its distribution and export. The seasonally produced DOC on the shelf can be exported to the open ocean by horizontal transport at comparable rates (1-2 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) to particulate organic carbon burial in the southern U.S. Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB).

Three different periods defined by stages of the hydrologic regime of the region, (1) post dry flushing period, (2) intermediary period, and (3) start of the dry period/post flush, were sampled. Temporal variability in DOM quantity and quality was observed with highest DOC, lignin concentration (Sigma(8)) and carbon-normalized (Lambda(8)) values during the flushing period attributed to greater surface runoff and leaching of organic-rich horizons, with lowest values in the dry period/post flush once source materials were well leached. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM) was strongly correlated to DOC and Sigma(8) (r(2) = 0.85 and 0.83, respectively; p < 0.001), and CDOM quality measurements (SUVA(254), spectral slope ratio and fluorescence index) were strongly correlated to Lambda(8) values (r(2) = 0.77, 0.69, and 0.75, respectively; p < 0.001), demonstrating the ability to derive DOC and lignin export and to track DOM quality in tropical riverine systems from simple optical measurements. This study demonstrates similar effects in the variability of DOM quantity and quality due to changing hydrologic inputs for a tropical river as has been previously reported for temperate and northern high-latitude rivers. Therefore, flushing periods in tropical rivers warrant further study, as they are critical toward understanding ecosystem biogeochemistry as maximal export of freshly leached plant material occurs during this time period.

The Effects of Salinity, pH, and Dissolved Organic Matter on Acute Copper Toxicity to the Rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis ("L" Strain)	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												This paper presents data from original research for use in the development of a marine biotic ligand model and, ultimately, copper criteria for the protection of estuarine and marine organisms and their uses. Ten 48-h static acute (unfed) copper toxicity tests using the euryhaline rotifer Brachionus plicatilis ("L" strain) were performed to assess the effects of salinity, pH, and dissolved organic matter (measured as dissolved organic carbon; DOC) on median lethal dissolved copper concentrations (LC50). Reconstituted and natural saltwater samples were tested at seven salinities (6, 11, 13, 15, 20, 24, and 29 g/L), over a pH range of 6.8-8.6 and a range of dissolved organic carbon of < 0.5-4.1 mg C/L. Water chemistry analyses (alkalinity, calcium, chloride, DOC, hardness, magnesium, potassium, sodium, salinity, and temperature) are presented for input parameters to the biotic ligand model. In stepwise multiple regression analysis of experimental results where salinity, pH, and DOC concentrations varied, copper toxicity was significantly related only to the dissolved organic matter content (pH and salinity not statistically retained; alpha = 0.05). The relationship of the 48-h dissolved copper LC50 values and dissolved organic carbon concentrations was LC50 (mu g Cu/L) = 27.1 x DOC (mg C/L)(1.25); r (2) = 0.94.				Smith, D.

Spatio-temporal variation in the characteristics of dissolved organic matter in the streams of boreal forests: Impacts on modelled copper speciation	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important constituent of natural waters that controls numerous biogeochemical processes such as the toxicity and mobility of metals. In order to predict how metals behave in the presence of DOM, it is necessary to understand its acidic properties. In this study, we report the variations in the acid character of aquatic organic acids using 30 years of sampling data collected from three boreal streams. Based on a charge balance model, significant spatial and temporal variation in carboxylic acid site density was observed. The seasonal average carboxylic group density ranged from 8.01 +/- 1.47 to 12.0 +/- 1.90 mu eq mg C(-1) and the overall (multi-site) average site density (winter excluded) was 9.66 +/- 0.125 mu eq mg C(-1) (n = 3193). Both different sources of DOM and seasonal differences in source availability were found to contribute to variations in site density. In the deciduous catchment where wetland contributions to DOM were negligible, the seasonal variability in site density was highly marked with increases of up to 50% observed between spring and fall. Less seasonal variation was noted at the coniferous sites, which had relatively high wetland source contributions. The geochemical equilibrium speciation model MINTEQA2 showed that the increase in site density observed from winter to fall coincided with a decrease in free copper concentration. We conclude that some source-based differences in DOM that may result from variation in both catchment characteristics and seasonal DOC loadings necessitate the determination of location-specific and/or seasonal site density values due to the resulting variability in metal speciation that has been predicted through modelling.

J	Wu, QY; Hu, HY; Zhao, X; Li, Y				Wu, Qian-Yuan; Hu, Hong-Ying; Zhao, Xin; Li, Yi			Effects of chlorination on the properties of dissolved organic matter and its genotoxicity in secondary sewage effluent under two different ammonium concentrations	CHEMOSPHERE												Recently, NH(4)(+) has been reported to induce potential risks during wastewater chlorination. Thus, the effects of chlorination on genotoxicity and fluorescence spectra of secondary sewage effluents, were investigated in this study before and after adding a high NH(4)(+) quantity. Chlorination decreased the genotoxicity of secondary sewage effluent, while the presence of a high level of NH(4)(+) inhibited this decrease. By further ultrafiltration following XAD-8 resin fractionation, it was found that, with a high NH(4)(+) concentration, the genotoxicity in the fraction of hydrophobic acids (HOA) increased after chlorination and a sub-fraction of HOA with molecular weight less than 1 kDa was the key fraction resulting in this increase. Similar to genotoxicity changes, NH(4)(+) was also found to influence the changes in fluorescence spectra during chlorination. After chlorination, the fluorescence intensity of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) notably decreased, and the emission band of DOM fluorescence spectra shifted to a lower wavelength. However, the presence of NH(4)(+) inhibited both the decrease in intensity and shift. The changes in fluorescence spectra suggested that the fluorescent structure of secondary effluent may decompose during chlorination, but NH(4)(+) could inhibit this decomposition.

Parallel factor analysis was used to extract the features of excitation-emission matrix spectra of dissolved organic substances in red tide algae growth process. The characteristic spectra of each alga were obtained. Then the similarities and dissimilarities of characteristic spectra of each alga were compared, to provide a basis for the identification of red tide algae based on the excitation-emission matrix spectra of dissolved organic substances in red tide algae growth process. The relationships between the fluorescence intensities and algae growth phases were also investigated. The results show that the characteristic spectrum of each alga is different from each other. In the exponential phase, the positive relationships between the protein-like, humic-like fluorescence intensities and cell densities were observed. It implied that the fluorescent substances accumulated during the exponential phase. In the stationary and decadency phases, the protein-like and humic-like fluorescence intensities increased quickly, which suggested that the two kinds of fluorescent substances were produced by the broken algal cells and the degradation by marine bacteria. The results show that PARAFAC model can be successfully applied to extract the fluorescent spectra features of dissolved organic substances in red tide algae growth process and can be used to investigate the relationship between fluorescence intensities and algae growth phase.																	0253-3820	1872-2040				AUG	2010	38	8					1144	1150		10.3724/SP.J.1096.2010.01144						WOS:000281530100012

Correlations between Dissolved Organic Matter Optical Properties and Quantum Yields of Singlet Oxygen and Hydrogen Peroxide	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Various aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples produce singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) with quantum yields of 0.59 to 4.5% ((1)O(2) at 365 nm) and 0.017 to 0.053% (H(2)O(2), 300-400 nm integrated). The two species' yields have opposite pH dependencies and strong, but opposite, correlations with the E(2)/E(3) ratio (A(254) divided by A(365)). Linear regressions allow prediction of both quantum yields from E(2)/E(3) in natural water samples with errors ranging from -3% to 60%. Experimental evidence and kinetic calculations indicate that less than six percent of the H(2)O(2) is produced by reaction between (1)O(2) and DOM. The inverse relationship between the (1)O(2) and H(2)O(2) yields is thus best explained by a model in which precursors to these species are populated competitively. A model is presented, which proposes that important precursors to H(2)O(2) may be either charge-transfer or triplet states of DOM.																	0013-936X					AUG 1	2010	44	15					5824	5829		10.1021/es101005u						WOS:000280367200028	20593853

Dissolved organic matter leaching in some contrasting New Zealand pasture soils	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Leaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from pastoral soils is increasingly seen as an important but poorly understood process. This paper examined the relationship between soil chemical properties, microbial activity and the losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) through leaching from six pasture soils. These soils differed in carbon (C) (4.6-14.9%) and nitrogen (N) (0.4-1.4%) contents and in the amount of organic C and N that had accumulated or been lost in the preceding 20+ years (i.e. -5131 to +1624 kg C ha-1 year-1 and -263 to +220 kg N ha-1 year-1, respectively). The paper also examined whether between-soil-type differences in DOC and DON leaching was a major explanatory factor in the observed range of soil organic matter (SOM) changes in these soils. Between 280 and 1690 kg C ha-1 year-1 and 28-117 kg N ha-1 year-1 leached as DOC and DON, respectively, from the six soils in a lysimeter study, with losses being greater from two poorly drained gley soils. Losses of C and N of this magnitude, while at the upper end relative to published data, could not fully explain the losses at Rawerawe, Bruntwood and Lepperton sites reported by Schipper et al. (2007). The study highlights the leaching of DOM as a significant pathway of loss of C and N in pasture soils that is often ignored or given little attention in predictive models and nutrient budgeting. Leaching losses of DOC and DON alone, or in combination with slightly increased respiration losses of SOM given a 0.2 degrees C increase in the mean annual soil temperature, do not fully explain long-term changes in the SOM observed at these sites. When soils examined in the present study were separated on the basis of drainage class, the losses of DOC by leaching were correlated with both total and hot-water extractable C (HWC), the latter being a measure of the labile SOM fraction. Basal microbial CO(2) respiration rates, which varied between 1 and 3.5 mu g CO(2)-C g-1 soil hour-1 in surface soils (0-75-mm depth), was also linked to HWC and the quantities of C lost as DOC. Adoption of the HWC method as an approach that could be used as a proxy for the direct measurement of the soil organic C lost by leaching as DOC or respired needs to be examined further with a greater number of soils. In comparison, a poor relationship was found between the hot-water extractable N (HWN) and loss of DON by leaching, despite HWN previously being shown to be a measure of the mineralizable pool of N in soils, possibly reflecting the greater competition for N than C in these soils.

Exoenzyme activities as indicators of dissolved organic matter composition in the hyporheic zone of a floodplain river	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. We measured the hyporheic microbial exoenzyme activities in a floodplain river to determine whether dissolved organic matter (DOM) bioavailability varied with overlying riparian vegetation patch structure or position along flowpaths. 2. Particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity and temperature were sampled from wells in a riparian terrace on the Queets River, Washington, U.S.A. on 25 March, 15 May, 20 July and 09 October 1999. Dissolved nitrate, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus were also collected on 20 July and 09 October 1999. Wells were characterised by their associated overlying vegetation: bare cobble/young alder, mid-aged alder (8-20 years) and old alder/old-growth conifer (25 to > 100 years). POM was analysed for the ash-free dry mass and the activities of eight exoenzymes (alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta -N-acetylglucosaminidase, xylosidase, phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, esterase and endopeptidase) using fluorogenic substrates. 3. Exoenzyme activities in the Queets River hyporheic zone indicated the presence of an active microbial community metabolising a diverse array of organic molecules. Individual exoenzyme activity (mean +/- standard error) ranged from 0.507 +/- 0.1547 to 22.8 +/- 5.69 mu mol MUF (g AFDM)-1 h-1, was highly variable among wells and varied seasonally, with the lowest rates occurring in March. Exoenzyme activities were weakly correlated with DO, DOC and inorganic nutrient concentrations. 4. Ratios of leucine aminopeptidase : beta-glucosidase were low in March, May and October and high in July, potentially indicating a switch from polysaccharides to proteins as the dominant component of microbial metabolism. 5. Principal components analysis indicated that there were patch effects and that these effects were strongest in the summer. 6. DOM degradation patterns did not change systematically along hyporheic flowpaths but varied with overlying forest patch type in the Queets River hyporheic zone, suggesting that additional carbon inputs exist. We hypothesise that the most likely input is the downward movement of DOM from overlying riparian soils. Understanding this movement of DOM from soils to subsurface water is essential for understanding both the hyporheic metabolism and the carbon budget of streams and rivers.				yang, lixia/D-7815-2011													0046-5070					AUG	2010	55	8					1603	1615		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02383.x						WOS:000279734300002

The fate of most of this exported material is remineralization to CO(2), which accumulates in deep waters until it is eventually ventilated again at the sea surface. However, a proportion of the fixed carbon is not mineralized but is instead stored for millennia as recalcitrant dissolved organic matter. The processes and mechanisms involved in the generation of this large carbon reservoir are poorly understood.

Characterization of dissolved organic matter in northern peatland soil porewaters by ultra high resolution mass spectrometry	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) was used to identify the qualitative differences between dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fen and bog porewaters from the Red Lake II system in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (CLAP) of northern Minnesota. Approximately 80% of the molecular composition in surface porewater was maintained throughout the upper portion of the bog profile (0.17-2.50 m). The qualitative stability of the composition of the DOM was accompanied by a quantitative increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with depth. The composition of DOM in the fen was significantly different at depth, with slightly varying DOC levels. Aromaticity index (AI) values were used to identify condensed aromatic and phenol-type compounds in the porewater of both peatlands. Surface bog and deep fen DOM had surprisingly similar molecular composition. Differences in enzymatic degradation rates via phenol oxidase in the bog and surface fen horizons, slower transport down the bog vertical profile and the presence of a stratum of Sphagnum-woody peat at depth in the fen are suggested as being responsible for the observed variations in DOM composition.

Temperature and Hydrologic Controls on Dissolved Organic Matter Mobilization and Transport within a Forest Topsoil	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Variations in concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in streams and rivers reflect, in part, coupled biogeochemical and hydrological processes that govern DOM mobilization and transport through soils. We explore the effects of temperature and rainfall characteristics on the quantity and composition of DOM mobilized from laboratory columns packed with an unsaturated forest soil. Our observations demonstrate that changes in temperature and a five-month drought period affect the mass and structure of DOM mobilized during soil-water infiltration, while changes in rainfall intensity and hourly to daily changes in the frequency of rainfall affect only the mass of DOM mobilized. The spectroscopic analyses indicate that DOM mobilized at low temperature is less humified and tends to be less condensed and lower in molecular weight. The C:N ratios of effluent DOM decline with cumulative rainfall volume during successive rainfall events and decrease by an average of 36% owing to the extended drought period. A two-region model that accounts for rate-limited DOM desorption from soil-water interfaces present within inter-aggregate and intra-aggregate pore spaces closely describes the time-series data on total concentrations of DOM eluted from the soil columns during the rainfall events.																	0013-936X					JUL 15	2010	44	14					5423	5429		10.1021/es1002296						WOS:000279747100021	20552956

Organic C and N mineralization as affected by dissolved organic matter in paddy soils of subtropical China	GEODERMA												In this study, dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and mineralization of soil organic C and N in subtropical China were investigated. Paddy and upland soils were derived from Tertiary sandstone, Quaternary red clay and river alluvium with low, middle, and high levels of soil fertility. Dissolved organic carbon contents (DOC) varied from 3.8 to 68.7 mg/kg and dissolved organic nitrogen contents (DON) ranged from 2.9 to 18.3 mg/kg, respectively, during the experimental period. Both DOC and DON increased with increasing soil fertility. The content of DOM was characterized by strong seasonal fluctuation in soils, and seasonal patterns showed the maximum value in Nov and the minimum in July. The contribution of DOM to mineralization of C and N was significantly affected by soil types and seasons. DOM removal significantly decreased the cumulative organic C mineralization in soils derived from Tertiary sandstone and River alluvium (by 1.6%-20.3% with an average of 7.1%), while it did not significantly change those in soils derived from Quaternary red clay. Similarly, the cumulative mineralization of N in paddy soils after DOM removal decreased by 6.7%-27.3% over seasons. In this study, DOM played an important role in soil C and N mineralization in subtropical China. It appears that contribution of DOM to minerilization of C and N in paddy soils was possibly related to DOM content and composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A combination of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) + aeration corrosive cell-Fenton (ACF) + granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption in series was proposed for the purpose of removing pollutants in the leachate. Fractionation was also performed to investigate the composition changes and characteristics of the leachate DOM in each treatment process. Experimental results showed that organic matter, in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD(5)), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), was reduced by 97.2%, 99.1%, and 98.7%, respectively. To differentiate the DOM portions. leachates were separated into five fractions by XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N), and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The predominant fraction in the raw leachate was HPO-A (36% of DOC), while the dominant fraction in the final effluent was HPI (53% of DOC). Accordingly, macromolecules were degraded to simpler ones in a relatively narrow range below 1000 Da. Spectral and chromatographic analyses also showed that most humic-like substances in all fractions were effectively removed during the treatments and led to a simultaneous decrease in aromaticity.

Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) variability in Barataria Basin using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) variability in Barataria Basin, Louisiana, USA,was examined by excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). CDOM optical properties of absorption and fluorescence at 355 nm along an axial transect (36 stations) during March, April, and May 2008 showed an increasing trend from the marine end member to the upper basin with mean CDOM absorption of 11.06 +/- 5.01, 10.05 +/- 4.23, 11.67 +/- 6.03 (m(-1)) and fluorescence 0.80 +/- 037, 0.78 +/- 0.39, 0.75 +/- 0.51 (RU), respectively. PARAFAC analysis identified two terrestrial humic-like (component 1 and 2), one non-humic like (component 3), and one soil derived humic acid like (component 4) components. The spatial variation of the components showed an increasing trend from station 1 (near the mouth of basin) to station 36 (end member of bay; upper basin). Deviations from this increasing trend were observed at a bayou channel with very high chlorophyll-a concentrations especially for component 3 in May 2008 that suggested autochthonous production of CDOM. The variability of components with salinity indicated conservative mixing along the middle part of the transect. Component 1 and 4 were found to be relatively constant, while components 2 and 3 revealed an inverse relationship for the sampling period. Total organic carbon showed increasing trend for each of the components. An increase in humification and a decrease in fluorescence indices along the transect indicated an increase in terrestrial derived organic matter and reduced microbial activity from lower to upper basin. The use of these indices along with PARAFAC results improved dissolved organic matter characterization in the Barataria Basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Albinet, A; Minero, C; Vione, D				Albinet, Alexandre; Minero, Claudio; Vione, Davide			Photochemical generation of reactive species upon irradiation of rainwater: Negligible photoactivity of dissolved organic matter	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This paper focuses on the study of the photochemical activity of dissolved organic matter present in rainwater. Formation rates of the reactive species hydroxyl radical (OH(center dot)), singlet oxygen CO(2)) and dissolved organic matter triplet states ((3)DOM*) were determined by irradiation (UV-A) of wet-only rainwater samples collected in Turin (Italy) in the presence of specific scavengers (benzene, furfuryl alcohol and phenol, respectively). Photo-formation rates of OH(center dot) (approximate to 3.10(-11) M s(-1)) and (1)O(2) (approximate to 10(-14) M s(-1)) were lower (1 or 2 orders of magnitude) or largely lower (4 to 10 orders of magnitude) than those determined for fog and cloud samples in previous studies. (3)DOM* formation rate values were either negligible or quite low (approximate to 10(-12) M s(-1)) by comparison with those evaluated for surface water samples. Deduced steady-state [OH(center dot)] were in the same range as those reported for fog samples in the literature (8.7 . 10(-16) to 1.5 . 10(-15) M), while [(1)O(2)] was often several orders of magnitude lower and, therefore, could be considered as negligible. Nitrite (NO(2)(-)) constituted the main source of OH(center dot) (69 +/- 21 to 138 +/- 36%), and the deduced contribution of DOM was low or nil. All the results obtained in this study tend to demonstrate that DOM (including HUmic LIke Substances, HULIS) present in rainwater is poorly or not photoactive. Therefore, there could be considerable difference between rainwater DOM (HULIS included) and the organic matter present in surface waters, particularly the humic substances, as far as the photochemical activity is concerned.

In this study, we systematically examine the effect of humic acid (HA) on surface charge status and aggregation potential of magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) NPs, selected as a model for metal oxide NPs, over a wide range of solution pH and ionic strength. Through zeta potential (ZP) measurements, we found that HA can adsorb to magnetite particles hence modifying their surface charge status. At low loadings, the presence of HA can induce a shift in the point zero of charge of due to partial neutralization of the positive charges on magnetite NPs. At high loadings, however. HA is capable of completely cover magnetite particles giving rise to a suspension ZP profile similar to its own (observed in presence of 20 mg L(-1) HA). These impacts on surface charge correspond well with the observed aggregation behaviors in the absence and presence of HA. From the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, fast aggregation, which is independent of solution chemistry, took place when the pH is close to the point zero charge (PZC) and the ionic strength is above the critical coagulation concentration (CCC). At high ionic strength, a small dose (2 mg L(-1)) of HA stabilized the NPs' suspension significantly. This stabilization effect is substantially enhanced with increasing HA concentration. The calculated DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) interaction energy profiles, using experimentally determined values of Hamaker constant, adequately support the experimental observations. The DLVO analysis further reveals the possible presence of secondary energy minima and the possibility of deaggregation of magnetite agglomerates. The complexation of HA-NPs and the HA effects on NPs aggregations were confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (a(g)(412) in m(-1)) showed an inversed linear relationship with salinity, indicating conservative mixing between freshwater and seawater, although the relationship changed with seasons and locations. On average, except in the vicinity of two major rivers (Minjiang River and Jiulongjiang River), a(g)(412) was higher in October (dry season) (0.173 +/- 0.036 m(-1)) than in April (wet season) (0.123 +/- 0.059 m(-1)). This observation is counter intuitive but consistent with those derived from MODIS satellite measurements. Combined with the CDOM EEM spectra (fluorescence excitation-emission matrix), the results suggest that 1) Minjiang River and jiulongjiang River were the primary land-based CDOM sources; 2) The marine end-members were controlled by the South China Sea Warm Current in April and the Zhe-Min Coastal Water in October; 3) The land-based CDOM was more from sewage than from soil leaching; and 4) Light absorption in the blue wavelengths was dominated by CDOM and detritus.

Effects of storm events on mobilisation and in-stream processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a Welsh peatland catchment	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Peatlands are important contributors of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to downstream aquatic systems. We investigated the effects of storm events on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM quality in a stream draining a Welsh peatland catchment. Intensive stream samples were collected and analysed for pH, DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), absorbance and fluorescence. Soil water samples and samples of sphagnum pore water were also collected, and a simple end-member mixing model was applied to account for changes occurring during the events. Fluorescence data were interpreted using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). DOC concentrations increased and pH decreased during the storm events. The soil water data and the mixing model indicated that this was due to a change of flow paths and draining of the DOC-rich acrotelm. Absorbance indices and the DOC/DON ratio suggested that the DOM released during events was less degraded. There was a striking, inversely related diurnal pattern in absorbance and fluorescence after the discharge peak. The diurnal pattern and a lack of fit with the mixing model suggested that fluorescing DOM was mainly produced in-stream. Fluorescence has been found to peak in the morning and decline during day-time due to photo-bleaching. We hypothesise that the input of additional DOM during events causes a change in the diurnal pattern, giving a peak at mid-day, when the processing of the additional DOM is highest.

Molecular characterization of dissolved organic matter associated with the Greenland ice sheet	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Subsurface microbial oxidation of overridden soils and vegetation beneath glaciers and ice sheets may affect global carbon budgets on glacial interglacial timescales. The likelihood and magnitude of this process depends on the chemical nature and reactivity of the subglacial organic carbon stores. We examined the composition of carbon pools associated with different regions of the Greenland ice sheet (subglacial, supraglacial, proglacial) in order to elucidate the type of dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in the subglacial discharge over a melt season. Electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry coupled to multivariate statistics permitted unprecedented molecular level characterization of this material and revealed that carbon pools associated with discrete glacial regions are comprised of different compound classes. Specifically, a larger proportion of protein-like compounds were observed in the supraglacial samples and in the early melt season (spring) subglacial discharge. In contrast, the late melt season (summer) subglacial discharge contained a greater fraction of lignin-like and other material presumably derived from underlying vegetation and soil. These results suggest (1) that the majority of supraglacial DOM originates from autochthonous microbial processes on the ice sheet surface, (2) that the saglacial DOM contains allochthonous carbon derived from overridden soils and vegetation as well as autochthonous carbon derived from in situ microbial metabolism, and (3) that the relative contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous material in subglacial discharge varies during the melt season. These conclusions are consistent with the hypothesis that, given sufficient time (e.g., overwinter storage), resident subglacial microbial communities may oxidize terrestrial material beneath the Greenland ice sheet.

Changes in the compound classes of dissolved organic matter along an estuarine transect: A study using FTIR and C-13 NMR	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In this work, we use Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13 NMR) data to quantify the changes of major chemical compound classes (carboxylic acid, amide, ester, aliphatic, aromatic and carbohydrate) in high molecular weight (HMW, >1 kDa) dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated along a transect through the Elizabeth River/Chesapeake Bay system to the coastal Atlantic Ocean off Virginia, USA. Results show that carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds are lost along the transect, while H M W DOC becomes enriched in carbohydrate moieties that could have a mid-transect source, perhaps the intensive red tide bloom (Choclodinium polykrikoides) which occurred during our sampling period. Taking the second derivative of the FTIR spectra resolved three pools of de-protonated carboxylic acids at our Dismal Swamp site (used to represent terrestrial organic matter in this area): one carboxylic acid pool, complexed with iron, seems to be lost between the Dismal Swamp and river sites; the second appears biogeochemically active throughout the riverine transect, disappearing in the coastal ocean sample; the third seems refractory, with the potential to be transported to and to accumulate within the open ocean. Five-member ring esters (gamma-lactones) were the major ester form in the Dismal Swamp; aliphatic and acetate esters were the dominant esters in the estuary/marine DOM. No amide groups were detectable in Dismal Swamp DOM; secondary amides were present at the estuarine/marine sites. Coupling FTIR with C-13 NMR provides new insights into the biogeochemical roles of carboxylic acid, amide and ester compounds in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
