In the present study, surface sediment samples were collected from different outfalls of the Nanfei River, an important urban river in Chaohu Lake Basin, China. Fluorescence and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrums were used to analyze the components and characteristics of surface sediment DOM. The results showed that four fluorescent components were resolved by analyzing the three dimensional fluorescence spectrum matrix data of the DOM from fluvial sediments with the PARA-FAC model. Humic-like substances are the main component, and microbiological degradation is the primary source, these results indicated that microorganisms played an important role in the formation of DOM in the sediments. For different types of outfalls, sediment DOM from the rainwater outfalls has a low value of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and proteinoid; and sediment DOM from rainwater, sewage outfalls and tributaries outfalls have more microbiological degradation components. The fluorescence index (FI) is sensitive enough to indicate both the different types of outfalls and the microbiological degradation components of humic-like substances. The spectral slope ratio from 275 nm to 295 nm (S275-295) has a certain relationship with the microbiological degradation components, and S350-400 increases when the proteinoid component becomes larger. The difference of DOM quantity between different types of outfalls suggests that foreign water has intensive effects on sediment DOM fractions in the urban fluvial system, and the spectral fingerprint of DOM acts as a proxy for revealing the origins and formation processes in the sediment.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	1					56	62								WOS:000351332300008

A new algorithm to retrieve chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption spectra in the UV from ocean color	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Accurate estimation of the absorption coefficient (a(g)) for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) over ultraviolet (UV) and short visible radiation wavelengths (with =275-450 nm) is crucial to provide a robust assessment of the biogeochemical significance of UV in the global ocean. Using a training data set spanning a variety of water types from the clearest open ocean to dynamic inshore waters, a novel algorithm to accurately resolve CDOM absorption spectra from ocean color is presented. Employing a suite of multivariate statistical approaches (principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and multiple linear regression), this new algorithm was developed with matched field data for CDOM spectra and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) bands. Freed from any presupposition about CDOM spectral shape or conventional spectral extrapolations from visible data, our algorithm allows direct retrieval of a fully resolved CDOM absorption spectrum over UV wavelengths from visible R-rs and further enables a global scale view of the dynamics of CDOM over different water types. Accuracy of a(g) retrieval is good, with a mean absolute percent difference for a(g) in the UV of approximate to 25%. With fully resolved spectra, maps of calculated CDOM spectral slopes (S275-295, S350-400) and slope ratios (S-R) are presented with the potential to provide new information about the chemical composition (e.g., molecular weight and aromaticity), sources, transformation, and cycling pathways of CDOM on global as well as regional scales. The new algorithm will contribute to improved accuracy for photochemical and photobiological rate calculations from ocean color.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JAN	2015	120	1					496	516		10.1002/2014JC010241						WOS:000349890000029

Effects of molecular weight on the diffusion coefficient of aquatic dissolved organic matter and humic substances	CHEMOSPHERE												In situ measurements of labile metal species using diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) passive samplers are based on the diffusion rates of individual species. Although most studies have dealt with chemically isolated humic substances, the diffusion of dissolved organic matter (DOM) across the hydrogel is not well understood. In this study, the diffusion coefficient (D) and molecular weight (MW) of 11 aquatic DOM and 4 humic substances (HS) were determined. Natural, unaltered aquatic DOM was capable of diffusing across the diffusive gel membrane with D values ranging from 2.48 x 10(-6) to 5.31 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1). Humic substances had diffusion coefficient values ranging from 3.48 x 10(-6) to 6.05 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1), congruent with previous studies. Molecular weight of aquatic DOM and HS samples (similar to 500-1750 Da) measured using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) strongly influenced D, with larger molecular weight DOM having lower D values. No noticeable changes in DOM size properties were observed during the diffusion process, suggesting that DOM remains intact following diffusion across the diffusive gel. The influence of molecular weight on DOM mobility will assist in further understanding and development of the DGT technique and the uptake and mobility of contaminants associated with DOM in aquatic environments.

Origin and fate of particulate and dissolved organic matter in a naturally iron-fertilized region of the Southern Ocean	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Natural iron fertilization of high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters induces annually occurring spring phytoplankton blooms off the Kerguelen Islands (Southern Ocean). To examine the origin and fate of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM), D- and L-amino acids (AA) were quantified at bloom and HNLC stations. Total hydrolyzable AA accounted for 21-25% of surface particulate organic carbon (% POCAA) at the bloom sites, but for 10% at the HNLC site. A marked decrease in % POCAA with depth was observed at the most productive stations leading to values between 3 and 5% below 300 m depth. AA contributed to only 0.9-4.4% of dissolved organic carbon (%DOCAA) at all stations. The only consistent vertical trend was observed at the most productive station (A3-2) where %DOCAA decreased from similar to 2% in the surface waters to 0.9% near 300 m. These AA yields revealed that POM and DOM were more rapidly altered or mineralized at the bloom sites compared to the HNLC site. Alteration state was also assessed by trends in C / N ratio, % D-AA and degradation index. Different molecular markers indicated that POM mostly originated from diatoms and bacteria. The estimated average proportion of POM from intact phytoplankton cells in surface waters was 45% at the bloom station A3-2, but 14% at the HNLC site. Estimates based on D-AA yields indicated that similar to 15% of POM and similar to 30% of DOM was of bacterial origin (cells and cell fragments) at all stations. Surprisingly, the DOM in HNLC waters appeared less altered than the DOM from the bloom, had slightly higher dissolved AA concentrations, and showed no sign of alteration within the water column. Unfavorable conditions for bacterial degradation in HNLC regions can explain these findings. In contrast, large inputs of labile organic molecules and iron likely stimulate the degradation of organic matter (priming effect) and the production of more recalcitrant DOM (microbial carbon pump) during iron-fertilized blooms.

Therefore, we investigated the photolysis of different species of NOR and the impact of a ubiquitous component of natural water - dissolved organic matter (DOM), which has a special photochemical activity and normally acts as a sensitizer or inhibiter in the photolysis of diverse organics; furthermore, scavenging experiments combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were performed to evaluate the transformation of NOR in water. The results demonstated that NOR underwent direct photolysis and self-sensitized photolysis via hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) based on the scavenging experiments. In addition, DOM was found to influence the photolysis of different NOR species, and its impact was related to the concentration of DOM and type of NOR species. Photolysis of cationic NOR was photosensitized by DOM at low concentration, while zwitterionic and anionic NOR were photoinhibited by DOM, where quenching of center dot OH predominated according to EPR experiments, accompanied by possible participation of excited triplet-state NOR and 10 identification of different NOR species in solutions with/without DOM indicated that NOR underwent different photodegradation pathways including dechlorination, cleavage of the piperazine side chain and photooxidation, and DOM had little impact on the distribution but influenced the concentration evolution of photolysis intermediates. The results implied that for accurate ecological risk assessment of emerging ionizable pollutants, the impact of DOM on the environmental photochemical behavior of all dissociated species should not be ignored.

DOM was rejected from the ice phase and accumulated in the remaining liquid phase during water freezing. Moreover, the decrease in freezing temperature, as well as the increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of feed water, caused an increase in DOM captured in the ice phase. The ultraviolet-absorbing compounds, trihalomethane precursors, as well as fulvic acid- and humic acid-like fluorescent materials, were more liable to be to be rejected from the ice phase and were more easily retained in the unfrozen liquid phase during water freezing, as compared with organics (on average) that comprise DOC. In addition, it was also found a higher accumulation of these organics in the unfrozen liquid phase during water freezing at higher temperature. The freeze/thaw processes altered the quantity, optical properties, and chlorine reactivity of DOM. The decrease in ultraviolet light at 254 nm as well as the production of aromatic protein- and soluble microbial byproduct-like fluorescent materials in DOM due to freeze/thaw were consistently observed. On the other hand, the changes in DOC, trihalomethane formation potential, and fulvic acid- and humic acid-like fluorescence caused by freeze/thaw varied significantly between samples.

Field experiments were conducted under normal flow conditions in the Kumaki River, which is located in the central part of the Noto Peninsula in Japan, during the period 2009-2010. The concentrations and structural properties of fulvic acid-like components, which are the major components of DOM, were determined using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. The relative fluorescence intensity for fulvic acid-like components at an excitation wavelength of 305-335 nm and an emission wavelength of 425-440 nm increased from the upper forest area to the lower paddy field area and increased seasonally in this river system in the following order: winter, autumn, spring, summer. Fulvic acid-like components with a higher molecular weight were observed in the summer samples. These results suggest that higher precipitation and agricultural activity in the summer season increase the amount of fulvic acid-like components with higher molecular weight that are transported from the watershed into the river.																	1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2015	16	1					55	68		10.1007/s10201-014-0441-4						WOS:000348982900006		
J	Ya, C; Anderson, W; Jaffe, R				Ya, Chao; Anderson, William; Jaffe, Rudolf			Assessing dissolved organic matter dynamics and source strengths in a subtropical estuary: Application of stable carbon isotopes and optical properties	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in subtropical coastal bays are complex. For example, variations in DOM characteristics and sources in Florida Bay are believed to be mainly driven by both hydrology and associated runoff of terrestrial DOM, and by primary productivity mostly from seagrass sources. However, confirmation and quantification of different DOM sources are still incomplete and needed for carbon budget assessments. Optical parameters based on excitation emission matrix fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) that had previously been tentatively assigned to both terrestrial and seasgrass sources. These correlated linearly with determined delta C-13 values, confirming an allochthonous, hydrologically-driven terrestrial source for the humic-like fluorescent components, while autochthonous DOM reflected by the protein-like fluorescence is mainly derived through primary productivity of seagrass communities. This study demonstrated the feasibility of combining optical signatures and stable isotopes in advancing the understanding of DOM dynamics in estuarine systems. Using stable carbon isotopic signatures of DOM, and applying a simple two endmember mixing model, the relative contributions of these two sources to the DOM pool in the bay were estimated. Results indicate that the highest proportion of DOM (ca. 72%) during the dry season was seagrass-derived, but clear variations were observed on both spatial and temporal scales. Limitations to the application of optical properties for the quantitative estimation of DOM sources in such coastal systems are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Turnover time of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the dark global ocean	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the largest reservoirs of reduced carbon on Earth. In the dark ocean (4200 m), most of this carbon is refractory DOM. This refractory DOM, largely produced during microbial mineralization of organic matter, includes humic-like substances generated in situ and detectable by fluorescence spectroscopy. Here we show two biquitous humic-like fluorophores with turnover times of 435 +/- 41 and 610 +/- 55 years, which persist significantly longer than the similar to 350 years that the dark global ocean takes to renew. In parallel, decay of a tyrosine-like fluorophore with a turnover time of 379 +/- 103 years is also detected. We propose the use of DOM fluorescence to study the cycling of resistant DOM that is preserved at centennial timescales and could represent a mechanism of carbon sequestration (humic-like fraction) and the decaying DOM injected into the dark global ocean, where it decreases at centennial timescales (tyrosine-like fraction).

Variable C: N: P stoichiometry of dissolved organic matter cycling in the Community Earth System Model	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the ocean's biological carbon pump by providing an advective/mixing pathway for similar to 20% of export production. DOM is known to have a stoichiometry depleted in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) compared to the particulate organic matter pool, a fact that is often omitted from biogeochemical ocean general circulation models. However the variable C: N: P stoichiometry of DOM becomes important when quantifying carbon export from the upper ocean and linking the nutrient cycles of N and P with that of carbon. Here we utilize recent advances in DOM observational data coverage and offline tracer-modeling techniques to objectively constrain the variable production and remineralization rates of the DOM C : N: P pools in a simple biogeochemical-ocean model of DOM cycling. The optimized DOM cycling parameters are then incorporated within the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and validated against the compilation of marine DOM observations. The optimized BEC simulation including variable DOM C: N: P cycling was found to better reproduce the observed DOM spatial gradients than simulations that used the canonical Redfield ratio. Global annual average export of dissolved organic C, N, and P below 100 m was found to be 2.28 PgC yr(-1) (143 TmolC yr(-1)), 16.4 Tmol Nyr(-1), and 1 Tmol P yr(-1), respectively, with an average export C : N: P stoichiometry of 225 : 19 : 1 for the semilabile (degradable) DOM pool. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export contributed similar to 25% of the combined organic C export to depths greater than 100 m.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	1					209	221		10.5194/bg-12-209-2015						WOS:000347960800013

Air oxidation of a fresh coal tar was chosen to simulate the abiotic natural attenuation impact on PAC-contaminated soils. Water-leaching experiments were subsequently performed on fresh and oxidized coal tars to study the influence of oxidation on dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity. The characterization of the DOM was performed using a combination of molecular and spectroscopic techniques (high-performance liquid chromatography-size-exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC), 3D fluorescence, and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)) and compared with the DOM from contaminated soils sampled on the field exposed to natural attenuation for several decades. An increase in the oxygenated polycyclic aromatic compound concentrations was observed with abiotic oxidation both in the coal tar and the associated DOM. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the leachates exceeded pure water solubility limits, suggesting that co-solvation with other soluble organic compounds occurred. Furthermore, emission excitation matrix analysis combined with synchronous fluorescence spectra interpretation and size-exclusion chromatography suggests that oxidation induced condensation reactions which were responsible for the formation of higher-molecular weight compounds and potentially mobilized by water. Thus, the current composition of the DOM in aged soils may at least partly result from (1) a depletion in lower-molecular weight compounds of the initial contamination stock and (2) an oxidative condensation leading to the formation of a higher-molecular weight fraction. Abiotic oxidation and water leaching may therefore be a significant combination contributing to the evolution of coal tar-contaminated soils under natural attenuation.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2015	22	2					1431	1443		10.1007/s11356-014-3465-8						WOS:000348047400067	25146121

However, estimating DOC from optical remote sensing requires a robust relationship between CDOM and DOC. This is particularly problematic for reservoirs because they have variable dissolved organic matter composition that complicates the CDOM-DOC relationship. We investigated six manmade reservoirs along a temperate to tropical gradient that represent a range of reservoir types and watershed conditions to determine whether a linear relation between CDOM and DOC could be established. We measured CDOM absorption and DOC concentration during the wet and dry seasons in the six reservoirs. We found the CDOM absorption coefficient and CDOM spectral slope were uncorrelated due to exogenous DOC inputs from multiple sources. Alone, the absorption coefficient of CDOM was a poor predictor of DOC concentration. Including both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope in a multiple regression accounted for both composition and concentration, significantly improving the regression r(2). By using both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope, we identify a framework for a potential solution to overcome the influence of dissolved organic matter source and transformation history on the CDOM-DOC relationship. We conclude that local variability, seasonality and optical complexity should be considered in remote sensing based approaches for global freshwater DOC estimation.

EEMs spectra showed 2 types of fluorescence signals in DOM samples, three humic-like fluorescence peaks and two protein-like fluorescence peaks, respectively. The former included UVC peak A (Ex/Em: 230/430 nm) UVA peak C (Ex/Em: 350/440 nm), and UVA peak M (Ex/Em: 300/380,similar to 400 nm), while the latter included tryptophan-like peaks R (Ex/Em: 230/355 375 nm) and N (Ex/Em: 280 similar to 300/365 similar to 380 run). Peak N was more like a combination of Peak M and Peak R. Moreover, free tyrosine-like molecules in DOM from the seagrass-beds ecosystem did not exist because the tyrosine-like fluorescence was not found. There were significant positive correlations of peak N with M and R (0. 97 and 0. 54 for R-2, respectively), and peak A with C (0. 86 for R-2), showing their same sources and biogeochemical behaviors. The change law of mean fluorescence intensities of those fluorescence signals was R (0. 304 RU) >A (0. 194 RU) >M (0. 147 RU) >N (0. 125 RU) >C (0. 051 RU). And, higher center dot L-1 concentrations of all the fluorescence occurred in the coastal waters inshore, with low values in two small regions located in the southwest and southeast of the bay where the seagrasses flourished. The distributions of those fluorescence signals in Xincun Bay suggested that the dynamics responsible for the humic-like fluorescence might be the same as that responsible for the protein-like fluorescence. The high fluorescence index (F1: 1. 81), high biological index (BIX: 1. 44) and low humification index (HDCa: 4. 2 and HIX13: 0. 81) showed that the DOM from the seagrass-dominant ecosystem has a strong autochthonous contribution and poor humification degree. The results clearly suggested that the DOM in this region has a rather unique fluorescence characteristic and is quite different from other aquatic environments.																	1000-0593					JAN	2015	35	1					141	145		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)01-0141-05						WOS:000347672500030		
J	Wang, ZG; Cao, J; Meng, FG				Wang, Zhigang; Cao, Jing; Meng, Fangang			Interactions between protein-like and humic-like components in dissolved organic matter revealed by fluorescence quenching	WATER RESEARCH												Numerous reports have documented the interactions of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) with other compounds such as metals and trace contaminants by characterizing the fluorescence quenching of the FDOM components. As FDOM is composed of numerous components, inter-component interactions can potentially take place. This study investigated the interactions between protein-like and humic-like components in FDOM using titration experiments and end-member mixing tests. We found that the co-occurrence of protein-like and humic-like components in FDOM samples resulted in an overlap behavior between their fluorescence peaks related to inter-component interactions. Our results suggest that the fluorescence of the protein-like components could be greatly quenched by the humic-like components in the FDOM samples, e.g., the humic-like components from Suwannee River and Nordic Reservoir FDOM yielded significant quenching effect for tyrosine (52% and 46%, respectively) and tryptophan (35% and 36%, respectively) in the titration experiments. The fluorescence of the humic-like components, however, was not impacted by the protein-like components. With the help of complexation modeling, we found that the binding capability between protein-like and humic-like components was dependent on their sources. This study could enhance our current knowledge on the role of FDOM in water and it is also important to the monitoring of FDOM by fluorescence spectroscopy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Relationships between molecular weight and fluorescence properties for size-fractionated dissolved organic matter from fresh and aged sources	WATER RESEARCH												Relationships between the molecular weight (MW) and fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are important considerations for studies seeking to connect these properties to water treatment processes. Relationships between the size and fluorescence properties of nine allochthonous DOM sources (i.e. leaf leachates, grass, and headwaters) were measured using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) with on-line absorbance and fluorescence detectors. Correlations between optical properties and MW were readily apparent using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) coupled to self-organizing maps (SOM): protein/polyphenol-like fluorescence (peaks B and T) was highest at lower molecular weights (<0.5 kDa), fulvic/humic-like fluorescence (peaks A, C, and M) was highest at mid-weights (0.5-1 kDa), and humic-like fluorescence (Peaks A + C) was highest at larger molecular weights (>1 kDa). Proportions of peaks B, T, and A + C were significantly correlated with MW (p <0.001). The first principal component (PC1, 42% of variation in fluorescence properties) was a significant predictor of sample MW (R2 = 0.63, p < 0.05), while scores on PC2 (27% of total variance) traced a source-based gradient from deciduous leachates/headwaters through to coniferous leachates/headwaters. PC3 (13% of var.) was also correlated with MW (p <0.005). A secondary peak in peak T fluorescence was associated with larger size fractions in aged sources, and scores on PC1 also traced a path from the leachates of fresher leaves, through more humified leaves, to headwaters. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the structure of aged DOM arises through supramolecular assembly.																	0043-1354					JAN 1	2015	68						487	497		10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.013						WOS:000347756900044	25462755

Mobility of Dissolved Organic Matter from the Suwannee River (Georgia, USA) in Sand-Packed Columns	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Transport of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the Suwannee River and of synthetic polystyrene sulfonates (PSSs) was investigated in columns packed with naturally Fe/Al-oxide-coated sands from Oyster, Virginia. Surface-water samples were collected in May 2012 and processed by XAD-8 (humic substances; HPOA), XAD-4 (transphilic acids [TPIAs]), and reverse osmosis (broad range of components; NOM). Median transport time (R-o) of PSSs increased with molecular weight (MW) from 1,000 to 8,000 Da but decreased for the largest PSS (18,000 Da), which is consistent with previous observations of MW effects on DOM adsorption and transport. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of HPOAs and NOM were similar whereas TPIA transport was distinct; although all DOM samples had similar R-o values, BTC asymmetry and dispersivity were greater for TPIAs. All samples exhibited power-law tailing that is characteristic of heterogeneous sorbent/sorbate interactions, potentially including kinetic effects. The one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation was unable to capture the tailing but it was captured well using a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) model. CTRW parameters were similar for the NOM and HPOA samples but distinctly different for TPIAs, which had more pronounced tailing. While retardation of organics generally tends to increase with MW, the lower average MW of TPIAs did not result in decreased overall retardation, which suggests the importance of compositional differences. Results suggest that while TPIAs tend to be a relatively minor component of DOM, their transport behavior differs from that of the predominant HPOA fraction, and they might thus have different impacts on pollutant transport.

Quantum Yields for the Formation of Reactive Intermediates from Dissolved Organic Matter Samples from the Suwannee River	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Photochemical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are of interest due to their effects on natural and engineered systems, including the fate and transport of organic contaminants and pathogen inactivation. DOM absorbs energy and produces different reactive intermediates (RI), including the hydroxyl radical (HO center dot), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), and excited triplet states ((DOM)-D-3*). Recently, a new set of DOM samples, including natural organic matter (NOM), the hydrophobic organic acid fraction (HPOA), and the transphilic acid fraction (TPIA) from the Suwannee River, were collected. Apparent quantum yields for the formation of HO center dot, O-1(2), and (DOM)-D-3* were measured for DOM samples using a solar simulator. Values were 2.09-4.20x10(-4) for triplet states, 2.74-6.54x10(-2) for singlet oxygen, and 0.95-1.65x10(-5) for hydroxyl radical for the different samples. In addition, fluorescence quantum yields were measured with obtained values between 0.79-1.3x10(-2). In some cases, values obtained were different from older DOM samples, indicating potential changes in properties of DOM in the Suwannee River over time.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				JAN 1	2015	32	1			SI		31	37		10.1089/ees.2014.0280						WOS:000347689600005

Concentrations and Distributions of Metals Associated with Dissolved Organic Matter from the Suwannee River (GA, USA)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Concentrations and distributions of metals in Suwannee River (SR) raw filtered surface water (RFSW) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) processed by reverse osmosis (RO), XAD-8 resin (for humic and fulvic acids [FA]), and XAD-4 resin (for "transphilic" acids) were analyzed by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF). SR samples were compared with DOM samples from Nelson's Creek (NLC), a wetland-draining stream in northern Michigan; previous International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) FA and RO samples from the SR; and an XAD-8 sample from Lake Fryxell (LF), Antarctica. Despite application of cation exchange during sample processing, all XAD and RO samples contained substantial metal concentrations. AsFlFFF fractograms allowed metal distributions to be characterized as a function of DOM component molecular weight (MW). In SR RFSW, Fe, Al, and Cu were primarily associated with intermediate to higher than average MW DOM components. SR RO, XAD-8, and XAD-4 samples from May 2012 showed similar MW trends for Fe and Al but Cu tended to associate more with lower MW DOM. LF DOM had abundant Cu and Zn, perhaps due to amine groups that should be present due to its primarily algal origins. None of the fractograms showed obvious evidence for mineral nanoparticles, although some very small mineral nanoparticles might have been present at trace concentrations. This research suggests that AsFlFFF is important for understanding how metals are distributed in different DOM samples (including IHSS samples), which may be key to metal reactivity and bioavailability.

In order to increase our understanding in this respect, we investigated the acute and chronic effects of various nAg materials on Daphnia magna. Thereby, different nanoparticle size classes with a citrate coating (20-, similar to 30-, 60- as well as 100-nm nAg) and one size class without any coating (140 nm) were tested, considering at the same time two pH levels (6.5 and 8.0) as well as the absence or presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM; <0.1 or 8.0 mg total organic carbon/L). Results display a reduced toxicity of nAg in media with higher pH and the presence of DOM as well as increasing initial particle size, if similarly coated. This suggests that the associated fraction of Ag species <2 nm (including Ag+) is driving the nAg toxicity. This hypothesis is supported by normalizing the 48-h EC50-values to Ag species <2 nm, which displays comparable toxicity estimates for the majority of the nAg materials assessed. It may therefore be concluded that a combination of both the particle characteristics, i.e. its initial size and surface coating, and environmental factors trigger the toxicity of ion-releasing nanoparticles.

Stabilisation of precipitates of pedogenic dissolved organic matter by multivalent cations	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Precipitation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by multivalent cations is important for biogeochemical cycling of organic carbon. We investigated to which extent cation bridges are involved in DOM precipitation and how cross-links by cations and water molecule bridges (WaMB) stabilise the matrix of precipitated DOM. DOM was precipitated from the aqueous extract of a forest floor layer adding solutions of Ca(NO3)(2), Al(NO3)(3) and Pb(NO3)(2) with different initial metal cation/C (Me/C) ratios. Precipitates were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry before and after ageing to detect cation bridges, WaMB and restructuring of supramolecular structure. Twenty-five to sixty-seven per cent of the dissolved organic carbon was precipitated. The precipitation efficiency of cations increased in the order Ca < Al < Pb, while the cation content of precipitates increased in the order Pb < Ca < Al. The different order and the decrease in the WaMB transition temperature (T*) for Al/C > 3 is explained by additional formation of small AlOOH particles. Thermal analysis indicated WaMB and their disruption at T* of 53-65 A degrees C. Like cation content, T* increased with increasing Me/C ratio and in the order Ca < Pb < Al for low Me/C. This supports the general assumption that cross-linking ability increases in the order Ca < Pb < Al. The low T* for high initial Me/C suggests less stable and less cross-linked precipitates than for low Me/C ratios. Our results suggest a very similar thermal behaviour of OM bound in precipitates compared with soil organic matter and confirms the relevance of WaMB in stabilisation of the supramolecular structure of cation-DOM precipitates. Thus, stabilisation of the supramolecular structure of the DOM precipitates is subjected to dynamics in soils.

We sampled four stations on the continental shelf and four stations on the continental slope near the mouth of the Columbia River, with sampling depths ranging from 0 to 1,678 m. Nitrate and phosphate concentrations were largely controlled by organic matter (OM) regeneration although the river plume may have led to excess nitrates in relation to phosphates near the river mouth and/or the surface. Four fluorescence components (C1 to C4) were identified by using excitation emission matrices-parallel factor analysis. C1 and C2 were assigned as humic-like components which represented degraded DOM rather than OM of allochthonous or autochthonous origin. C3 and C4 were both labile, protein-like components representing autochthonous contributions, while C4 was more sensitive to diagenesis. In the shallow water layer (salinity a parts per thousand currency sign32.5 and depth a parts per thousand currency sign50 m), the variation in absorption properties (SUVA(254) and E >(280)), fluorescence index, freshness index (beta/alpha), percent fluorescence of C3, and delta C-13-DOC revealed that the Columbia River plume exported DOM that was characterized by greater aromaticity, higher molecular weight, and being more decomposed than marine, autochthonous DOM. However, these signatures of terrigenous DOM disappeared rapidly with increasing depth and offshore distance. In the intermediate and deep water layers (salinity > 32.5), the DOM indices were most driven by diagenesis, with changes in percent fluorescence components indicating increasing accumulation of humic DOM relative to protein-like DOM with depth. Principal component analysis that collectively assessed the DOM indices suggests that diagenesis was the primary factor driving the spatial variability of DOM properties in the study region, underlining challenges in tracing allochthonous DOM in coastal waters.

We used excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEMs) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to detect the chemical composition of headwater stream DOM and riparian water-extractable soil organic matter (WSOM) among four different vegetation types, including evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF), coniferous forest (CF), subalpine dwarf forest (SDF) and alpine meadow (AM), along an altitudinal gradient (690-2060 m above sea level) in the Wuyi Mountains of subtropical China. Fluorescence index (FI) and biological/autochthonous index (BIX) values indicated that stream DOM was from terrestrial sources. Despite this link to terrestrial sources, the composition of stream DOM differed remarkably from that of riparian WSOM. Humic-like PARAFAC component C2 was observed in headwater streams, but not in riparian WSOM. Conversely, humic-like C3 compound was identified in riparian WSOM, but not in headwater streams. The relative abundance of humic-like C1 and C2 compounds did not differ among the headwater streams under four different vegetation types across the altitudinal gradient. In contrast, the relative abundance of C1 compounds in riparian WSOM was substantially higher in EBF than in other vegetation types. The relative abundance of tryptophan-like C4 compounds decreased from 26.47-54.26% in riparian WSOM to 5.71-14.24% in headwater streams. The relative abundance of tryptophan-like C4 compounds was higher in AM and EBF streams than in SDF and CF streams, and decreased in the order of AM > CF > SDF > EBF in the riparian WSOM. Our data suggest that variation in chemical composition of WSOM among four different vegetation types along an altitudinal gradient in the Wuyi Mountains does not induce corresponding changes in the chemical composition of stream DOM. Biogeochemical processes of plant-litter input directly into streams and bio-degradation and selective adsorption of DOM along a generalized hydrologic flow path from soil to stream may cause these qualitative differences between stream DOM and riparian WSOM composition across four different vegetation types along an altitudinal gradient in the Wuyi Mountains.

The origins and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bioavailable DOM were monitored during a long-term (2-year) study of groundwater in a fractured-rock aquifer in the Carolina slate belt. Surface precipitation was significantly correlated with groundwater concentrations of DOC, bioavailable DOM and chromophoric DOM, indicating strong hydrological connections between surface and ground waters. The physicochemical and biological processes shaping the concentrations and compositions of DOM during its passage through the soil column to the saturated zone are conceptualized in the regional chromatography model. The model provides a framework for linking hydrology with the processes affecting the transformation, remineralization and microbial production of DOM during passage through the soil column. Lignin-derived phenols were relatively depleted in groundwater DOM indicating substantial removal in the unsaturated zone, and optical properties of chromophoric DOM indicated lower molecular weight DOM in groundwater relative to surface water. The prevalence of glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and d-enantiomers of amino acids indicated the DOM was highly diagenetically altered. Bioassay experiments were used to establish DOC-normalized yields of amino acids as molecular indicators of DOM bioavailability in groundwater. A relatively small fraction (8 +/- A 4 %) of DOC in groundwater was bioavailable. The relatively high yields of specific d-enantiomers of amino acids indicated a substantial fraction (15-34 %) of groundwater DOC was of bacterial origin.

The A + OSA process showed a good performance in nitrogen and organic pollutants removal efficiency, and reduced sludge yield by 32% under a sludge retention time of 6 h in the anaerobic sludge holding tank (SHT). Parallel factor analysis was used to assess DOM composition from EEM spectra and three fluorescent components were identified: two humic-like components and one protein-like component. In the A + OSA process, the humic-like components were difficult to degraded, while the protein-like component was easily hydrolyzed and adsorbed under anoxic conditions. The fluorescence intensities of the humic-like and protein-like components were both strengthened in the SHT owing to sludge decay under the anaerobic condition. GPC analysis of the A + OSA system showed that the majority of molecules in the influent wastewater with molecular weight (MW) in the range of >250 and 30-50 kDa were mainly transformed into small molecules with MW in the range of 30-250 and <0.5 kDa in the effluent by microorganisms. The DOM in the SHT effluent demonstrated a broader MW distribution and higher intensity than that in the SHT influent, and the percentage of MW between 10 and 30 kDa in the SHT effluent were significantly increased owing to cell lysis and decay in the SHT.

The DOM characteristics of molecular weight (MW) distribution, hydrophobicity, and fluorescence in source water W1 (synthesized water) and W2 ("Longtan" lake water), FBWW and treated water samples therefore are identified, and three recycling ratios of 2%, 5%, and 8% as compared to control (0%) are conducted. It is found that DOM within FBWW becomes more hydrophilic and lower MW as compared to corresponding source water. Recycling trials indicate that higher DOM concentrations and more low-MW fractions are not of any benefit to enhance UV254 and DOC removal. Hydrophobic acid can be further eliminated in case recycling particles mainly produced by sweep flocculation, while weakly hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic fraction can be enhanced and removed under recycling particles mainly formed by charge neutralization. Higher molecular weight fraction (>30 kDa) exhibits potentially enhanced removal at preferred recycling ratio of 5%. Fluorescent characteristics analysis demonstrate that recycling FBWW can effectively improve humic-like substances removal, but the protein-like matters are resistant to be eliminated with unvaried structure.																	0149-6395	1520-5754				DEC 12	2014	49	18					2981	2989		10.1080/01496395.2014.945599						WOS:000345505400020		
J	Scheibe, A; Gleixner, G				Scheibe, Andrea; Gleixner, Gerd			Influence of Litter Diversity on Dissolved Organic Matter Release and Soil Carbon Formation in a Mixed Beech Forest	PLOS ONE												We investigated the effect of leaf litter on below ground carbon export and soil carbon formation in order to understand how litter diversity affects carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. C-13 labeled and unlabeled leaf litter of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior), characterized by low and high decomposability, were used in a litter exchange experiment in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). Litter was added in pure and mixed treatments with either beech or ash labeled with C-13. We collected soil water in 5 cm mineral soil depth below each treatment biweekly and determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC), delta C-13 values and anion contents. In addition, we measured carbon concentrations and delta C-13 values in the organic and mineral soil (collected in 1 cm increments) up to 5 cm soil depth at the end of the experiment. Litter-derived C contributes less than 1% to dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected in 5 cm mineral soil depth. Better decomposable ash litter released significantly more (0.50 +/- 0.17%) litter carbon than beech litter (0.17 +/- 0.07%). All soil layers held in total around 30% of litter-derived carbon, indicating the large retention potential of litter-derived C in the top soil. Interestingly, in mixed (ash and beech litter) treatments we did not find a higher contribution of better decomposable ash-derived carbon in DOM, O horizon or mineral soil. This suggest that the known selective decomposition of better decomposable litter by soil fauna has no or only minor effects on the release and formation of litter-derived DOM and soil organic matter. Overall our experiment showed that 1) litter-derived carbon is of low importance for dissolved organic carbon release and 2) litter of higher decomposability is faster decomposed, but litter diversity does not influence the carbon flow.																	1932-6203					DEC 8	2014	9	12							e114040	10.1371/journal.pone.0114040						WOS:000346907600038	25486628

Here we investigate the temporal and spatial variation in dissolved Fe redox state in a high dissolved organic matter (DOM) estuarine system, the River Beaulieu. We couple manual sample collection with the deployment of an autonomous in situ analyser, designed to simultaneously measure dissolved Fe(II) and total dissolved Fe, in order to investigate processes operating on the diurnal timescale and to evaluate the performance of the analyser in a high DOM environment. Concentrations of dissolved Fe available to the ligand ferrozine are elevated throughout the estuary (up to 21 mu M in freshwater) and notably higher than those previously reported likely due to seasonal variation. Fe(II) is observed to account for a large, varying fraction of the dissolved Fe available to ferrozine (25.5 +/- 12.5%) and this fraction decreases with increasing salinity. We demonstrate that the very high DOM concentration in this environment and association of this DOM with dissolved Fe, prevents the accurate measurement of dissolved Fe concentrations in situ using a sensor reliant on rapid competitive ligand exchange.

Seasonal changes in estuarine dissolved organic matter due to variable flushing time and wind-driven mixing events	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study examined the seasonality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) sources and transformations within the Neuse River estuary (NRE) in eastern North Carolina between March 2010 and February 2011. During this time, monthly surface and bottom water samples were collected along the longitudinal axis of the NRE, ranging from freshwater to mesohaline segments. The monthly mean of all surface and bottom measurements made on collected samples was used to clarify larger physical mixing controls in the estuary as a whole. By comparing monthly mean trends in DOM and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) properties in surface and bottom waters during varying hydrological conditions, we found that DOM and CDOM quality in the NRE is controlled by a combination of discharge, wind speed, and wind direction. The quality of DOM was assessed using C:N ratios, specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), the absorption spectral slope ratio (S-R), and the humification (HIX) and biological (BIX) indices from fluorescence. The NRE reflects allochthonous sources when discharge and flushing time are elevated at which times SUVA(254) and HIX increased relative to base flow. During periods of reduced discharge and long flushing times in the estuary, extensive autochthonous production modifies the quality of the DOM pool in the NRE. This was evidenced by falling C:N values, and higher BIX and SR values. Lastly, a combination of increased wind speed and shifts in wind direction resulted in benthic resuspension events of degraded, planktonic OM. Thus, the mean DOM characteristics in this shallow micro-tidal estuary can be rapidly altered during episodic mixing events on timescales of a few weeks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Optical characterization and distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in soil porewater from a salt marsh ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To characterize chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in marsh porewaters and its contribution as a carbon source, optical properties (absorbance, fluorescence indices, 3-dimensional excitation-emission matrices [EEMs]) of soil porewater and surface water were measured in a southern Californian salt marsh. Absorption coefficients and fluorescence intensities were higher in porewater than in overlying surface waters, consistent with higher CDOM concentration at depth. Humic-type peaks A and C were observed in EEMs in all samples, and peak M was observed in surface waters and shallow porewater to -5 cm depth. Fluorescence: absorbance (flu:abs) ratios and spectral slopes (S) decreased across the surface interface, and emission peak maxima were red-shifted-changes that are consistent with increasing molecular weight (MW) and aromaticity in soil porewater due to humification, and lower-MW, less aromatic material in oxic surface waters from oxidative photochemical and biological processing. At lower depths, bands were observed where intensity, flu: abs ratios and S increased; absorption coefficients decreased; emission maxima for humic-type peaks were blue-shifted; and tryptophan-type protein peaks were observed. These changes are consistent with lower-MW and less aromatic material from enhanced microbial activity. Variations in iron concentrations and sulfate depletion with depth were consistent with these bands having different dominant anaerobic microbial metabolic pathways. Overall, optical property trends suggest that soil porewater is a reservoir of CDOM in the salt marsh, with organic material from terrestrial watershed inputs and in situ production from marsh vegetation stored and processed in sediments.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC 3	2014	516						71	83		10.3354/meps10833						WOS:000346418900007

Scott			Modeling Nonequilibrium Adsorption of MIB and Sulfamethoxazole by Powdered Activated Carbon and the Role of Dissolved Organic Matter Competition	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study demonstrates that the ideal adsorbed solution theory-equivalent background compound (IAST-EBC) as a stand-alone model can simulate and predict the powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption of organic micropollutants found in drinking water sources in the presence of background dissolved organic matter (DOM) under nonequilibrium conditions. The IAST-EBC represents the DOM competitive effect as an equivalent background compound (EBC). When adsorbing 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) with PAC, the EBC initial concentration was a similar percentage, on average 0.51%, of the dissolved organic carbon in eight nonwastewater impacted surface waters. Using this average percentage in the IAST-EBC model yielded good predictions for MIB removal in two nonwastewater impacted waters. The percentage of competitive DOM was significantly greater in wastewater impacted surface waters, and varied markedly in DOM size fractions. Fluorescence parameters exhibited a strong correlation with the percentage of competitive DOM in these waters. Utilizing such correlations in the IAST-EBC successfully modeled MIB and sulfamethoxazole adsorption by three different PACs in the presence of DOM that varied in competitive effect. The influence of simultaneous coagulant addition on PAC adsorption of micropollutants was also investigated. Coagulation caused the DOM competitive effect to increase and decrease with MIB and sulfamethoxazole, respectively.

Influence of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter, colloids, and cations on nanofiltration of pharmaceutically active and endocrine disrupting compounds	CHEMOSPHERE												This study examined the rejection of selected pharmaceutically active (PhAC) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) when using nanofiltration as a function of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM), colloidal particles, cations and their interactions. Lake Ontario water served as a source of natural DOM and colloidal particles. PhAC/EDC rejection experiments were conducted using raw Lake Ontario water and Lake Ontario water that was pre-treated with either ultrafiltration to remove colloidal particles, or fluidized ion exchange resins to remove DOM. Additionally, the concentration of cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+) in the raw and pre-treated water matrices was varied. While ionic PhACs and EDCs exhibited high rejections from all the water matrices examined, neutral compounds were most effectively rejected in water containing DOM and no colloids, and least effectively rejected from colloid-containing water with increased cations but no DOM. The presence of DOM significantly improved compound rejection and the increase in cation concentration significantly decreased rejection. The presence of colloids had comparatively little effect except to mitigate the impact of increased cation concentration, apparently providing some cation-buffering capacity. The sequence in which constituents are removed from waters during treatment may significantly impact PhAC and EDC removal, especially of neutral compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Spectrometric characterization of the effluent dissolved organic matter from an anammox reactor shows correlation between the EEM signature and anammox growth	CHEMOSPHERE												Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is a cost-effective process to treat high-strength nitrogenous wastewater. Even without organic carbon input, the effluent contains bioproducts from autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. In this work, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the effluent dissolved organic matter (EfOM) from an anammox reactor treating synthetic wastewater. Two dominant EEM components were identified as humic acid-like (component 1) and protein-like (component 2) substances with excitation/emission peaks at <240, 355, 420/464 nm and <240, 280, 330/346 nm, respectively. The presence of both compounds in the effluent was tracked during an activity recovery period (nitrogen load increased from 0.2 to 1.3 kg N m(-3) d(-1)). The effluent concentration of both components increased during this period, indicating correlation between production and bacterial activity. The dynamics of these bioproducts during both substrate consumption and starvation phases was analyzed in batch experiments. Component 1 was only formed during substrate consumption in a rate proportional to ammonium removal and was considered an up-take associated product characteristic of anammox activity. The results show that the composition of the EfOM was qualitatively and quantitatively influenced by process performance. Monitoring the EfOM could, therefore, offer a useful approach to assess anammox process performance and must be further explored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PAC addition increased the specific UV absorbance. Hydrophobic DOM especially hydrophobic acids in PAC/MBR effluent (50%) were more than MBR effluent (42%). DOM with molecular weight <1 kDa constituted 12% of PAC/MBR effluent DOM, which was less than that of MBR effluent (16%). Data obtained from excitation and emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that PAC/MBR effluent DOM contained more simple aromatic protein, but had less fulvic acid-like and soluble microbial by-product-like. PAC addition reduced the formation of bromine-containing THMs during chlorination of effluents, but increased THM formation reactivity of effluent DOM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To identify a basis for the selection of feasible technology in treating RO concentrates, the characteristics and biotoxicity of different fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in RO concentrates from an mWRRO system were investigated. The results indicated that the hydrophilic neutrals (HIN), hydrophobic acids (HOA) and hydrophobic bases (HOB) accounted for 96% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the total DOM in the RO concentrate. According to the SEC chromatograph detected at 254 nm wavelength of UV, the DOM with molecular weight (MW) 1-3 kDa accounted for the majority of the basic and neutral fractions. The fluorescence spectra of the excitation emission matrix (EEM) indicated that most aromatic proteins, humic/fulvic acid-like and soluble microbial by-product-like substances existed in the fractions HOA and hydrophobic neutrals (HON). The genotoxicity and anti-estrogenic activity of the RO concentrate were 1795.6 +/- 57.2 mu g 4-NQO L-1 and 2.19 +/- 0.05 mg TAM L-1, respectively. The HIN, HOA, and HOB contributed to the genotoxicity of the RO concentrate, and the HIN was with the highest genotoxic level of 1007.9 +/- 94.8 mu g 4-NQO L-1. The HOA, HON, and HIN lead to the total anti-estrogenic activity of the RO concentrate, and HOA occupied approximately 60% of the total, which was 13 +/- 0.17 mg TAM L-1. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that the DOM was degraded during composting in the order of aliphatic substances > proteinaceous compounds > cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, while humic substances transformed during the process in the order of fulvic-like matter > humic-like substances > protein-like matter. The fulvic- and humic-like substances originated from lignin and polysaccharide-like substances with the function groups of CH3, CCH2, CCH, OCH3, OCH, O-C-O, aromatic C, and COO, while the protein-like matter was derived from aliphatic and proteinaceous compounds with the functional groups of CCH3 and N-C=O. The aromatic C and COO were responsible for the oxidation capacity of the MSW-derived DOM, while the O-C-O and COO accounted for the Cu and Zn binding capacity of the DOM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In aquatic environments, widespread dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects the physical transfer, chemical transformation and bioavailability of heavy metal ions. In the arid inland lakes, water salinity has been increasing due to close hydrological system and much higher vaporization than precipitation, and thus there are usually salinity gradients in these inland lakes. The change of salinity may exert influences on complexation of DOM with heavy metals. However, response of the metal complexation of DOM to the salinity is still unclear. In this study, three-dimensional molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) was used to examine the interaction of Hg(II) and DOM in sediment along a salinity gradient of the Bosten Lake, the biggest inland freshwater lake in China. Three fluorescence peaks were identified in the EEM fluorescence spectra of all DOM samples. All the three fluorescence peaks could be quenched by Hg(II), indicating the formation of stable nonluminous DOM-Hg complexes. The conditional stability constant and binding constant for DOM-Hg(II) were 3.82-4.34 and 3.76-5.54, respectively. Conditional stable constants and binding constants for the system of Hg(II) and protein-like substances were higher than those for the humic substances-Hg(II) system. The ligand ratio of fluorophore to Hg(II) correlated well with the salinity. The strong complexation of Hg(II) and DOM and its responses to salinity change may significantly influence transport, transformation and ecological risk of Hg in Bosten Lake.																	0016-7029	1556-1968				DEC	2014	52	12					1072	1077		10.1134/S001670291412009X						WOS:000345407300005

Relationships Between Land Cover and Dissolved Organic Matter Change Along the River to Lake Transition	ECOSYSTEMS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) influences the physical, chemical, and biological properties of aquatic ecosystems. We hypothesized that controls over spatial variation in DOM quantity and composition (measured with DOM optical properties) differ based on the source of DOM to aquatic ecosystems. DOM quantity and composition should be better predicted by land cover in aquatic habitats with allochthonous DOM and related more strongly to nutrients in aquatic habitats with autochthonous DOM. Three habitat types [rivers (R), rivermouths (RM), and the nearshore zone (L)] associated with 23 tributaries of the Laurentian Great Lakes were sampled to test this prediction. Evidence from optical indices suggests that DOM in these habitats generally ranged from allochthonous (R sites) to a mix of allochthonous-like and autochthonous-like (L sites). Contrary to expectations, DOM properties such as the fluorescence index, humification index, and spectral slope ratio were only weakly related to land cover or nutrient data (Bayesian R (2) values were indistinguishable from zero). Strongly supported models in all habitat types linked DOM quantity (that is, dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC]) to both land cover and nutrients (Bayesian R (2) values ranging from 0.55 to 0.72). Strongly supported models predicting DOC changed with habitat type: The most important predictor in R sites was wetlands whereas the most important predictor at L sites was croplands. These results suggest that as the DOM pool becomes more autochthonous-like, croplands become a more important driver of spatial variation in DOC and wetlands become less important.

In this study, we first analyzed the absorption and fluorescence properties in a large subtropical reservoir and then used a chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence monitoring sensor to predict several water quality parameters including the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and CDOM fluorescence parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) components in the reservoir. The CDOM absorption coefficient at 254 nm (a(254)), the humic-like component (C1), and the tryptophan-like component (C3) decreased significantly along a gradient from the northwest to the lake center, northeast, southwest, and southeast region in the reservoir. However, no significant spatial difference was found for the tyrosine-like component (C2), which contributed only four marked peaks. A highly significant linear correlation was found between the a(254) and CDOM concentration measured using the CDOM fluorescence sensor (r(2) = 0.865, n = 76, p < 0.001), indicating that CDOM concentrations could act as a proxy for the CDOM absorption coefficient measured in the laboratory. Significant correlations were also found between the CDOM concentration and TN, TP, COD, DOC, and the maximum fluorescence intensity of C1, suggesting that the real-time monitoring of CDOM concentrations could be used to predict these water quality parameters and trace the humic-like fluorescence substance in clear aquatic ecosystems with DOC <2 mg/L and total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations <15 mg/L. These results demonstrate that the CDOM fluorescence sensor is a useful tool for on-line water quality monitoring if the empirical relationship between the CDOM concentration measured using the CDOM fluorescence sensor and the water quality parameters is calibrated and validated.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2014	21	24					14078	14090		10.1007/s11356-014-3319-4						WOS:000345314500034	25053284

In this study, DOM was characterized through a fingerprint analysis method for DOM characterization using resin fractionation followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Resin fractionation was used in the first step to divide the DOM in water samples into six resin fractions, namely, hydrophobic acids (HOA), hydrophobic bases (HOB), hydrophobic neutrals (HON), hydrophilic acids (HIA), hydrophilic bases (HIB), and hydrophilic neutrals (HIN). SEC analysis was then performed to separate each resin fraction into several (n) subfractions with different molecular weights (MW). Thus, the total DOM in the water sample was fractionated into 6n subfractions. After quantification of each subfraction by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a fingerprint graph was constructed to express the distribution of DOM in the subfractions. The fingerprint analysis method was applied to a secondary effluent sample during ozonation. Ozonation (dose of 10 mg L-1) removed the DOC only by 8 % and reduced UV254 of the sample by 36 %. Fingerprint graphs also revealed that the resin fractions changed quite limitedly but transformation of subfractions occurred notably.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2014	21	24					14211	14218		10.1007/s11356-014-3336-3						WOS:000345314500046	25056751

The photobleaching of DOM solutions after irradiation was characterized by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The photosensitizing properties of pre-irradiated DOM solutions were changed in a sunlight simulator. The performance of DOMs in photosensitized degradation of several contaminants was investigated. For a 20 h exposure, the observed degradation rate constant (k(obs)) of some contaminants decreased as a function of exposure time, and highly depended on the properties of both DOM and contaminant. Degradation of contaminants with lower k(obs) was more susceptible to DOM photobleaching-induced decrease in k(obs). Under the current experimental conditions, the photobleaching-induced decrease of DOM photo-reactivity in contaminant degradation was mainly attributed to indirect phototransformation of DOM caused by the interactions between photo-inductive DOM moieties and photochemically-produced reactive species. Reactive contaminants can inhibit DOM indirect photobleaching by scavenging reactive species, photosensitized degradation of these contaminants exhibited a stable k(obs) as a result. This is the first study to report DOM photobleaching-induced changes in the simultaneous DOM photosensitized degradation of contaminants and the inhibitory effect of reactive contaminants on DOM photobleaching.

Ofloxacin (OFL) was selected as a target antibiotic, and the interaction between OFL and sequential extracted dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the sediment of Dianchi, a hypertrophic lake in Southwest China, was explored using fluorescence quenching technology. The method of fuorescence quenching was used to characterize the interaction between OFL and sequentially extracted DOM. The result indicated that static and dynamic quenching both existed in the interaction. The interaction in the background water (0.01 mol/L NaCl and 200 mg/L NaN3) became increasingly weak with the further extraction of DOM. A low non-linear factor N value (0.53 similar to 0.63) of Freundlich model was observed, indicating a non-linear interaction between OFL and DOM. Elemental characterization and infrared spectrum analysis showed an enhanced OFL-DOM binding with the decrease in humic acid (HA) polarity. The effect of ion strength was tested in the OFL-DOM interaction to show the impact of usually existing metal ions in water environment on the OFL behavior. The result showed that K+ had little influence, but Cu2+ had a significant promotion (p < 0.05) in the OFL-DOM interaction in background water, indicating that divalent metal ions, which have the bridge bond or complexation capacity, are more active in the OFL-DOM interaction than monovalent ions, with no bridge bond or complexation capacity. This work would be useful in the fate and risk assessment of antibiotics in water environments.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2014	186	12					8857	8864		10.1007/s10661-014-4049-2						WOS:000344349200059	25223534

To explore these incompletely understood interactions, the leachability of 11 selected PCBs in a naturally aged soil was investigated in pH static leaching tests spanning a wide pH range (2 to 9). The K-d was calculated for each of the PCBs, based on their observed concentrations in the soil and leachates obtained from each test. The concentration and composition of DOM in each leachate were also determined, the latter using FTIR spectroscopy. Correlations between the DOM's FTIR spectra and K-d values were investigated by orthogonal projections to latent structures. The log K-d-values varied among the PCB congeners and were most variable at low pH, but the values for all studied congeners decreased with increasing pH, by up to 3 log units (for PCB 187). In the pH 5-7 interval, an abrupt decrease in log K-d values with increases in pH was observed, although the total organic carbon content remained relatively stable. The FTIR data indicate that fulvic and humic acids in DOM partially deprotonate as the pH rises from 5 to 7. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, Y; Lohwacharin, J; Takizawa, S				Yang, Yu; Lohwacharin, Jenyuk; Takizawa, Satoshi			Hybrid ferrihydrite-MF/UF membrane filtration for the simultaneous removal of dissolved organic matter and phosphate	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and phosphorus promote microbial regrowth in water distribution networks. Ferrihydrite (Fh) has a high adsorption affinity with DOM and phosphate. Hence, a lab-scale unit of the hybrid Fh-MF/UF membrane filtration system was used to evaluate membrane fouling and the removal efficiency of DOM and phosphate. Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) was used as a surrogate for DOM in natural water. The Fh-membrane system demonstrated removal rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV254 and phosphate up to 50%, 80% and 90%, respectively, at the PF dose of 17.5 mg/L. The effect of phosphate on the removal of DOM was different without or with the addition of Ph; namely, phosphate increased the DOM removal without Fh by interacting with the UF membrane made of regenerated cellulose (RC), but phosphate decreased the DOM removal by Fh due to the strong affinity of phosphate with Fh. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that phosphate mainly competed against smaller DOM molecules for Fh adsorption sites. Although the addition of Fh caused only a moderate flux decline with the RC membranes, the deposition of positively charged Fh on the surface of a negatively charged high-flux membrane, i.e., polyethersulfone (PES), caused a rapid decline of the permeation flux.

Mass spectrometric results revealed that flocculation induced substantial changes in the DOM and caused quantitative removal of DOM constituents that usually are associated with DBP formation While half of the chromophoric DOM (CDOM) was removed by flocculation, similar to 4-5 mg L-1 total organic carbon remained in the finished water. A conservative approach revealed the formation of similar to 800 mass spectrometry ions with unambiguous molecular formula assignments that contained at least one halogen atom. These molecules likely represented new DBPs, which could not be prevented by the flocculation process. The most abundant m/z peaks, associated with formed DBPs, could be assigned to C5HO3Cl3, C5HO3Cl2Br, C5HO3ClBr2 using isotope simulation patterns. Other halogen-containing formulas suggested the presence of halogenated polyphenolic and aromatic acid-type structures, which was supported by possible structures that matched the lower molecular mass range (maximum of 10 carbon atoms) of these DBPs. H-1 NMR before and after disinfection revealed an similar to 2% change in the overall H-1 NMR signals supporting a significant change in the DOM caused by disinfection. This study underlines the fact that a large and increasing number of people are exposed to a very diverse pool of organohalogens through water by both drinking and uptake through the skin upon contact. Nontarget analytical approaches are indispensable for revealing the magnitude of this exposure and to test alternative ways to reduce it.

In addition, dissolved organic matter (DOM) can serve as a carrier that enhances the migration and transformation of heavy metals. Here, pig manure amended with rice straw was vermicomposted with Eisenia fetida. The DOM content, molecular weight distribution, and spectroscopic properties of the amended pig manure were measured before and after vermicomposting. The Cu and Zn concentrations in the earthworms increased from 8.24 and 17.63 to 40.75 and 362.78 mg/kg separately after vermicomposting, and the earthworms also increased the heavy metal availability in the vermicompost. Relative to the DOM properties of conventional compost, the DOM molecular weight decreased and varied widely following vermicomposting, and the C/N ratio of the DOM in the vermicompost treatments decreased from 10.37 to 8.60. The Fourier transform far-infrared (FTIR) and fluorescence spectra of the DOM indicated that the amounts of oxygen-containing structures increased while the ratio of humic acid to fulvic acid decreased following vermicomposting. Accordingly, the earthworms augmented the heavy metal mitigation risk in the pig manure. This augment potentially resulted from the decreased humic acid-to-fulvic acid (HA/FA) ratio from DOM structural changes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2014	21	22					12684	12692		10.1007/s11356-014-3216-x						WOS:000344546900008	24958537

Two protein-like components (Cl, tyrosine and C2, tryptophan) and one humic-like component (C3) were identified by the DOM Fluor-PARAFAC model, with C3 constituting more than 95% of the total DOM, while Cl and C2 occupying a tiny fraction of DOM. The distribution of three PARAFAC-identified components was strongly influenced by the river direction, terrain and location of various water samples. The results suggested that DOM of samples collected from downstream or a central region had higher fluorescence intensity than those of upstream or surrounding the center. In addition, a negative linear correlation (R-2 = 0.8465) between pH (5.7-9.2) and fluorescence intensity of C3 was observed, indicating that the increase of pH might enhance the intensity of fluorescent humic-like substances. Although the fluorescence intensity of Cl and C2 was independent of pH changes, strong quenching effects of different heavy metals were presented for Cl, and evident positive correlations between C2 and concentrations of rare earth metals (La, Ce, Tb, Dy, Tm, etc.) were observed, which showed that tyrosine-like (Cl) and tryptophan-like (C2) substances were assumingly responsible for metal binding and adsorption in water, respectively. Based on EEM-PARAFAC modeling, all the fluorescence EEMs of samples could be decomposed into a three-component model, and their potential applications in water quality monitoring and metal-binding indicator were likely to be developed in the fluorescence analysis of natural water.																	2050-7887	2050-7895				NOV	2014	16	11					2527	2535		10.1039/c4em00380b						WOS:000344131200007

A full factorial biodegradation experiment (31 possible singular and multiple combinations of five litter type-derived DOM sources) was conducted using plant litters from the five most abundant plant species in a subtropical watershed ecosystem, from which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) disappearance was measured. Loss of DOC over time was considered biodegradable DOC. We tested whether DOM diversity, measured as source species richness and composition, would affect biodegradation rates. Overall, we found significant non-additive (synergistic) effects of DOM diversity on biodegradation rates of DOM, which were explained both by plant species richness and composition. Across all treatments, a significantly higher biodegradation rate was correlated with the presence of DOM from higher nitrogen (N) containing plant litters; conversely, the presence of lower N decreased these rates. The N content and chemical characteristic of DOM might influence the magnitude of the synergistic effect. Our results suggest that loss of plant litter species diversity would not affect DOC biodegradation rate, provided that at least two species are conserved. However, the variability in DOC biodegradation rate across the treatments decreased with increased DOM diversity at three incubation time points. Our results also indicate that in an ecosystem with low plant biodiversity, loss of key species such as Lophostemon confertus could reduce the synergistic effects on DOC biodegradation rate.

Evaluation of the prediction accuracy of the models is based on the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of correlation (CC), and Willmott's index of agreement (d).

Here, phenanthrene sorption was quantified on four types of nano-TiO2 (three rutile, one anatase), and a bulk, raw TiO2 powder. Prior to the sorption experiments, these nanoparticles were coated using four different organic materials: Lignin (LIG), tannic acid (TAN), Congo red (CON), and capsorubin (CAP). Lignin, tannic acid, congo red and capsorubin coating substantially enhanced phenanthrene sorption to various TiO2 particles. After coating with a specific DOM, K-d values by the DOM-coated TiO2 particles on percent organic carbon content and surface area (SA) basis (K-oc/SA) generally followed the order: TiO2 NPs with hydrophobic surfaces > bulk TiO2 particles > other TiO2 NPs. Different K-oc/SA values of various DOM-TiO2 complexes resulted from distinct conformation of the coated DOM and aggregation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The formation of cold, dense water in the subsurface layer of the western Arctic Ocean is a key process in the lateral transport of iron, macronutrients, and other chemical constituents. Here, we present iron, humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter, and nutrient concentration data in waters above the continental slope and shelf and along two transects across the shelf-basin interface in the western Arctic Ocean. We detected high concentrations in shelf bottom waters and in a plume that extended in the subsurface cold dense water of the halocline layer in slope and basin regions. At sigma(theta) = 526.5, dissolved Fe, humic-like fluorescence intensity, and nutrient maxima coincided with N* minima (large negative values of N* indicate significant denitrification within shelf sediments). These results suggest that these constituents are supplied from the shelf sediments and then transported laterally to basin regions. Humic dissolved organic matter probably plays the most important role in the subsurface maxima and lateral transport of dissolved Fe in the halocline layer as natural Fe-binding organic ligand.

J	Appiani, E; Page, SE; McNeill, K				Appiani, Elena; Page, Sarah E.; McNeill, Kristopher			On the Use of Hydroxyl Radical Kinetics to Assess the Number-Average Molecular Weight of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is involved in numerous environmental processes, and its molecular size is important in many of these processes, such as DOM bioavailability, DOM sorptive capacity, and the formation of disinfection byproducts during water treatment. The size and size distribution of the molecules composing DOM remains an open question. In this contribution, an indirect method to assess the average size of DOM is described, which is based on the reaction of hydroxyl radical (HO) quenching by DOM. HO is often assumed to be relatively unselective, reacting with nearly all organic molecules with similar rate constants. Literature values for HO reaction with organic molecules were surveyed to assess the unselectivity of DOM and to determine a representative quenching rate constant (k(rep) = 5.6 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)). This value was used to assess the average molecular weight of various humic and fulvic acid isolates as model DOM, using literature HO quenching constants, k(C,DOM). The results obtained by this method were compared with previous estimates of average molecular weight. The average molecular weight (M-n) values obtained with this approach are lower than the M-n measured by other techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC), vapor pressure osmometry (VPO), and flow field fractionation (FFF). This suggests that DOM is an especially good quencher for HO, reacting at rates close to the diffusion-control limit. It was further observed that humic acids generally react faster than fulvic acids. The high reactivity of humic acids toward HO center dot is in line with the antioxidant properties of DOM. The benefit of this method is that it provides a firm upper bound on the average molecular weight of DOM, based on the kinetic limits of the HO center dot reaction. The results indicate low average molecular weight values, which is most consistent with the recent understanding of DOM. A possible DOM size distribution is discussed to reconcile the small nature of DOM with the large-molecule behavior observed in other studies.

J	Xie, HX; Aubry, C; Zhang, Y; Song, GS				Xie, Huixiang; Aubry, Cyril; Zhang, Yong; Song, Guisheng			Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in first-year sea ice in the western Canadian Arctic	MARINE CHEMISTRY												We monitored the spatiotemporal progression of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in first-year sea ice in the western Canadian Arctic between mid-March and early July 2008. CDOM abundance in bottom ice, as quantified by absorption coefficient at 325 nm, a(CDOM)(325), showed a positive, linear relationship with the concentration of chlorophyll a, being low at the start of ice algal accumulation, highly enriched during the peak bloom and early post-bloom, and depleted again during sea ice melting. Vertical profiles of CDOM in early and late spring were typically characterized by slight to moderate elevations at both the surface and bottom and rather constancy within the interior ice. In the ice algae-thriving mid-spring, L-type profiles prevailed due to extremely high CDOM in the lowermost 10-cm layer. Bottom-layer CDOM in landfast ice (a(CDOM)(325): 15.8 m(-1)) more than doubled that in drift ice (a(CDOM)(325): 6.6 m(-1)). CDOM in the ice cover, except the bottom layer, was generally lower than or similar to that in the under-ice surface water. Salinity accounted for 58% of the CDOM variability in drift ice having minimal terrestrial and ice algal signatures. CDOM absorption spectra of algaerich bottom ice samples exhibited ultraviolet (UV) absorption shoulders attributable to mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). These compounds were readily photodegradable by solar UV radiation. Our results suggest that 1) inclusion of organic solutes and in situ biological production are the dominant processes controlling the distribution of CDOM in sea ice in the study area, 2) biological production in bottom ice is a minor source of CDOM to the underlying surface water; 3) CDOM plays a critical role in shielding sympagic organisms in bottom ice against UV radiation; 4) the MAAs are effective photoprotectants only under low-UV conditions.

Production of Black Carbon-like and Aliphatic Molecules from Terrestrial Dissolved Organic Matter in the Presence of Sunlight and Iron	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												Photochemical processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural waters can alter its composition and structure, supply particulate organic matter (POM) to sediments, and deliver modified terrestrial DOM to the ocean. Our studies show that terrestrial DOM exposed to simulated sunlight is altered to produce POM with a markedly different molecular composition enriched with newly formed aliphatic and condensed aromatic molecules. This process is closely tied to the chemistry of iron, which primarily exists as dissolved Fe(II) and Fe(III) - organic complexes in initial DOM and photochemically matures to Fe(III) oxyhydroxides before coprecipitating out with POM. The newly formed condensed aromatic compounds resemble black carbon, which until now was thought to be produced by only combustion. These new molecules contribute a pool of Fe-rich, aliphatic, and black carbon-like organic matter to sediments as the terrestrial DOM is transported through rivers. We estimate that the annual global flux of this photoproduced black carbon, most of which may be preserved in sediments, is nearly equivalent to the estimated flux of dissolved black carbon to the ocean from all other sources.																	2328-8930					OCT	2014	1	10					399	404		10.1021/ez5002598						WOS:000350831600004

Here we investigate the rates and mechanisms of MeHg photodegradation using DOM with varying oxidation states and origins as well as organic ligands with known molecular structures. All DOM and organic ligands increased the rate of MeHg photodegradation under solar irradiation, but the first-order rate constants,varied depending on the oxidation state of DOM and the type and concentration of the ligands. Reduced DOM photochemi-cally degraded MeHg 3 times faster than oxidized DOM. Compounds containing both thiol and aromatic moieties within the same molecule (e.g., 'thiosalicylate and reduced DOM) increased MeHg photodegradation rates far more than those containing only aromatics or thiols (e.g., salicylate or glutathione, or their combinations). The mechanism is attributed in part to strong binding between MeHg and thiolates that resulted in direct energy transfer from excited triplet state of the aromatics to break the Hg-C bond in MeHg. Our results suggest that, among other factors, the synergistic effects of thiol and aromatics in DOM greatly enhance MeHg photodegradation.

Rapid solid phase extraction of dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of molecules found ubiquitously in freshwater and saltwater environments. Its structures contain valuable information content on the sources of molecules as well as the mechanisms at work within an aquatic ecosystem. Recent advancements in high resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography have made inroads into determinations of the molecular structures within DOM. Such analyses, however, generally require a prior step to concentrate/ isolate DOM, and this step often limits the number of samples that can be analyzed. This study has developed a fast method to concentrate DOM on commercially available online solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, which can be directly eluted onto an HPLC-MS system. This rapid solid phase extraction (RSPE) method requires less sample (10-100 mL) than previous SPE methods for DOM isolation. Additionally, this study tested a suite of SPE phases to find a combination that improves DOM recovery as compared with commonly used approaches. When a polystyrene divinylbenzene phase (RP-1) was coupled with an activated carbon (CAR) phase, recoveries were found to be significantly higher than in previous SPE studies relying upon single phases. RSPE was tested for a diverse set of salty and freshwater samples with recoveries ranging from 46% to 78% of the total DOC. It was also tested on a suite of model compounds (including caffeine) and should be applicable to anthropogenic compounds in aquatic environments, although, in such cases, optimization may be needed to minimize the natural organic matter signal that was maximized in this study.																	1541-5856					OCT	2014	12						713	728		10.4319/lom.2014.12.713						WOS:000345346500006

Qualitative changes of riverine dissolved organic matter at low salinities due to flocculation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The flocculation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was studied along transects through three boreal estuaries. Besides the bulk concentration parameters, a suite of DOM quality parameters were investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM, and the molecular weight of DOM as well as associated dissolved iron concentrations. We observed significant deviations from conservative mixing at low salinities (<2) in the estuarine samples of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorption (a((CDOM254))), and humic-like fluorescence. The maximum deviation from conservative mixing for DOC concentration was -16%, at salinities between 1 and 2. An associated laboratory experiment was conducted where an artificial salinity gradient between 0 and 6 was created. The experiment confirmed the findings from the estuarine transects, since part of the DOC and dissolved iron pools were transformed to particulate fraction (>0.2 mu m) and thereby removing them from the dissolved phase. We also measured flocculation of CDOM, especially in the UV region of the absorption spectrum. Protein-like fluorescence of DOM decreased, while humic-like fluorescence increased because of salt-induced flocculation. Additionally, there was a decrease in molecular weight of DOM. Consequently, the quantity and quality of the remaining DOM pool was significantly changed after influenced to flocculation. Based on these results, we constructed a mechanistic, two-component flocculation model. Our findings underline the importance of the coastal filter, where riverine organic matter is flocculated and exported to the sediments.

Hourly, daily, and seasonal variability in the absorption spectra of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in a eutrophic, humic lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The short-term (hourly and daily) variation in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lakes is largely unknown. We assessed the spectral characteristics of light absorption by CDOM in a eutrophic, humic shallow mixed lake of temperate Sweden at a high-frequency (30min) interval and during a full growing season (May to October). Physical time series, such as solar radiation, temperature, wind, and partial pressures of carbon dioxide in water and air, were measured synchronously. We identified a strong radiation-induced summer CDOM loss (25 to 50%) that developed over 4months, which was accompanied by strong changes in CDOM absorption spectral shape. The magnitude of the CDOM loss exceeded subhourly to daily variability by an order of magnitude. Applying Fourier analysis, we demonstrate that variation in CDOM remained largely unaffected by rapid shifts in weather, and no apparent response to in-lake dissolved organic carbon production was found. In autumn, CDOM occasionally showed variation at hourly to daily time scales, reaching a maximum daily coefficient of variation of 15%. We suggest that lake-internal effects on CDOM are quenched in humic lake waters by dominating effects associated with imported CDOM and solar exposure. Since humic lake waters belong to one of the most abundant lake types on Earth, our results have important implications for the understanding of global CDOM cycling.

J	Bai, Y; Su, RG; Shi, XY				Bai, Ying; Su, Rongguo; Shi, Xiaoyong			Assessing the dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the southern Yellow Sea by excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Samples of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) that were collected from the southern Yellow Sea (SYS) in spring (March in 2011) and autumn (October in 2011) were analyzed by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) in combination with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). This method identified three terrestrial humic-like (Cl, C2 and C3) and one protein-like (C4) substances. The distribution patterns of the four components were different in spring and autumn. The impact of the circulation of the Yellow Sea Warm Current in spring and the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass in autumn in the central Yellow Sea (YS) could be important physical factors in explaining the variability of CDOM in seasonal patterns. The contributions of the humic-like components Cl and C2 increased from 33% and 12% (in spring) to 35% and 15% (in autumn) and that of the protein-like component C4 decreased from 20% (in spring) to 15% (in autumn), the contributions of C3 was not changed between the two seasons. Based on spatial and seasonal distributions, as well as correlations with salinity, the following assignments were made. The two terrestrial humic-like components Cl and C2 were assigned to a terrestrial origin. The other terrestrial humic-like component C3 was assigned to terrestrial and autochthonous origins. The protein-like component C4 was assigned to a combination of autochthonous production and terrestrial sources and most likely represented a biologically labile component. The lower HIX and higher FI in spring indicated CDOM was less stable and biological activity was higher than that in autumn. These results indicated that the CDOM in the SYS was primarily affected by terrestrial inputs, microbial processes and primary productivity of phytoplankton were also important sources.

With the aim of providing insight into the capacity of plant litter-derived DOM to influence sorption and desorption of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on soil, batch experiments were carried out with application of a sorption-desorption model incorporating DOM effects. Freshly fallen pine (Pinus elliottii) needles were used as the source of organic matter. Input of the pine needle litter-derived DOM was found to significantly decrease desorption hysteresis as well as soil adsorption capacity of phenanthrene (PHE) and fluoranthene (FLA). Addition of 1 728 mg L-1 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lowered the organic carbon-normalized sorption distribution coefficient of PEE from 7 776 to 2 541 L kg(-1) C and of FLA from 11 503 to 4 368 L kg(-1) C. Decreases of the apparent sorption-desorption distribution coefficients of PEE and FLA with increased DOC concentration indicated that DOM favored desorption of PAHs from soil. Increases in the fraction of apparently dissolved PAHs were attributable to the dissolved PAH-DOM complexes, accounting for the dissolved proportions of 39% to 69% for PHE and 26% to 72% for FLA in the sorption and desorption processes as the concentration of the added DOM solution rose from 0 to 1 728 mg L-1. Our results suggest that pine needle litterderived DOM can have a substantial effect of inhibiting PAHs sorption and promoting PAHs desorption, thus leading to enhanced leaching in soil, which should be taken into account in risk assessment of PAHs accumulated in forest soil				QIU, Rong-Liang/F-9450-2012; Garnier, Patricia/I-4249-2015													1002-0160	2210-5107				OCT	2014	24	5					575	584								WOS:000343378400002

We found that by dissolving DOM in H-2 O-18 at 95 A degrees C for 20 days it is possible to replace all oxygen atoms of DOM molecules (excluding oxygen from ether groups) with O-18. The number of exchanges in each molecule can be determined using high-resolution FTICR. Using the proposed method we identified the number of non-labile oxygen atoms in 231 molecules composing DOM. Also, using a previously developed hydrogen-deuterium (H/D)-exchange approach we identified the number of labile hydrogen atoms in 450 individual molecular formulas. In addition, we observed that several backbone hydrogen atoms can be exchanged for deuterium under acidic conditions. The method can be used for structural and chemical characterization of individual DOM molecules, comparing different DOM samples, and investigation of biological pathways of DOM in the environment.

To examine common salt marsh plants as sources of coastal DOM, two dominant salt marsh vascular plants Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemarianus, and two major coastal seagrasses Syringodium filiforme and Halodule wrightii, were collected from a Florida salt marsh and studied using laboratory incubation experiments. We investigated the leaching dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from these plants, in conjunction with our field investigations of the sources and outwelling of DOM from Florida salt marshes. The leaching of DOM and CDOM from the plants was a rapid process, and leaching rates were 65-288 A mu M/g dry weight/day for DOC and 3.8-16 A mu M/g dry weight/day for TDN from different plants in the bacteria-inhibited incubations. DOC was proportional to TDN in the leachates, but the quantity of C and N leached was dependent on the species and growth stage of the plants. At the end of the 25-day experiments, 5.4-23 % and 10-45 % of solid phase C and N were released into DOC and TDN pools, respectively. Bacteria played an important role during the leaching process. The majority of DOC and TDN leached from marsh plants and seagrasses was labile and highly biodegradable with 56-90 % of the leached DOC and 44-72 % of the leached TDN being decomposed at the end of the experiments. The fluorescence measurements of CDOM indicate that organic matter leached from marsh plants and seagrasses contained mainly protein-like DOM which was degraded rapidly by bacteria. Our study suggests that leaching of DOM from salt marsh plants and seagrasses provide not only major sources of DOC, TDN, and CDOM that affect many biogeochemical processes, but also as important food sources to microbial communities in the marsh and adjacent coastal waters.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2014	76	4					595	609		10.1007/s00027-014-0357-4						WOS:000342283000010		
J	Cawley, KM; Campbell, J; Zwilling, M; Jaffe, R				Cawley, Kaelin M.; Campbell, John; Zwilling, Melissa; Jaffe, Rudolf			Evaluation of forest disturbance legacy effects on dissolved organic matter characteristics in streams at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) source and composition are critical drivers of its reactivity, impact microbial food webs and influence ecosystem functions. It is believed that DOM composition and abundance represent an integrated signal derived from the surrounding watershed. Recent studies have shown that land-use may have a long-term effect on DOM composition. Methods for characterizing DOM, such as those that measure the optical properties and size of the molecules, are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for assessing DOM sources, cycling, and reactivity. In this study we measured DOM optical properties and molecular weight determinations to evaluate whether the legacy of forest disturbance alters the amount and composition of stream DOM. Differences in DOM quantity and composition due to vegetation type and to a greater extent, wetland influence, were more pronounced than effects due to disturbance. Our results suggest that excitation-emission matrix fluorescence with parallel factor analysis is a more sensitive metric of disturbance than the other methods evaluated. Analyses showed that streams draining watersheds that have been clearcut had lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and higher microbially-derived and protein-like fluorescence features compared to reference streams. DOM optical properties in a watershed amended with calcium, were not significantly different than reference watersheds, but had higher concentrations of DOC. Collectively these results improve our understanding of how the legacy of forest disturbances and natural landscape characteristics affect the quantity and chemical composition of DOM in headwater streams, having implications for stream water quality and carbon cycling.

This study examined the molecular and isotopic signatures of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along with its biolability in glacier ice, glacier-fed streams, and alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. The aim was to assess the sources of DOM and the potential of DOM to provide a carbon subsidy to downstream ecosystems. Tibetan glaciers and glacier streams exhibited low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (17.7-27.9 mu M) and ancient DOC radiocarbon ages (749-2350 ybp). The optical properties, stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13-DOC) and the molecular composition (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry) of Tibetan glacier DOM are consistent with data from other glacier systems around the world. The geochemical signatures and the ancient apparent ages of Tibetan glacier DOM suggest a significant fraction is derived from the atmospheric deposition of pre-aged, possibly fossil fuel derived organics. Within the Tibetan alpine lakes, DOC was also ancient (525-675 ybp), due to either inputs of pre-aged organics from glacier runoff, direct deposition, or due to the aging of organics in situ (i.e. a radiocarbon reservoir effect). The glacier ice and glacier stream sites exhibited high biolability of DOC and so provide a carbon subsidy to downstream environments that will change as glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau recede.

Functional and Structural Responses of Hyporheic Biofilms to Varying Sources of Dissolved Organic Matter	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Headwater streams are tightly connected with the terrestrial milieu from which they receive deliveries of organic matter, often through the hyporheic zone, the transition between groundwater and streamwater. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial sources (that is, allochthonous) enters the hyporheic zone, where it may mix with DOM from in situ production (that is, autochthonous) and where most of the microbial activity takes place. Allochthonous DOM is typically considered resistant to microbial metabolism compared to autochthonous DOM. The composition and functioning of microbial biofilm communities in the hyporheic zone may therefore be controlled by the relative availability of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM, which can have implications for organic matter processing in stream ecosystems. Experimenting with hyporheic biofilms exposed to model allochthonous and autochthonous DOM and using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA (targeting the "active" community composition) and of the 16S rRNA gene (targeting the "bulk" community composition), we found that allochthonous DOM may drive shifts in community composition whereas autochthonous DOM seems to affect community composition only transiently. Our results suggest that priority effects based on resource-driven stochasticity shape the community composition in the hyporheic zone. Furthermore, measurements of extracellular enzymatic activities suggest that the additions of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM had no clear effect on the function of the hyporheic biofilms, indicative of functional redundancy. Our findings unravel possible microbial mechanisms that underlie the buffering capacity of the hyporheic zone and that may confer stability to stream ecosystems.

CuO-oxidized dissolved organic matter (DOM) investigated with comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF-MS)	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												GC x GC-TOF-MS was applied to investigate the molecular diversity of CuO-oxidized, trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatized DOM isolated from Lake Tahoe's main tributary, the Upper Truckee River (UTR), California. Many (4789) chromatographic peaks were resolved in a single sample at a signal/noise (S/N) ratio of 10 or greater and > 300 (> 6%) were assigned discrete structures. Mapping the two dimensional elution time space revealed 8 homologous series defined by successive CH2 additions. Series of other compounds related to one another by OCH3 and OH substitutions were also assigned. Elucidation of the retention time (RT) displacements affected by these molecular transformations guided the discovery of novel compounds as well as those that had previously escaped detection within DOM, including a suite of ligninderived cyclobutane photodimers. Analysis of RT shifts among sets of benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) isomers revealed the second chromatographic dimension to strongly retain sterically strained isomers, providing a basis for assigning groups of isomers that were otherwise unassignable. The heightened chromatographic resolution also revealed a substantial and hitherto analytically inaccessible diversity of isomers, which appear to be uniquely resolved with the method, but which would fall outside the analytical window of other high resolution MS methods, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR-MS). The study likely represents the most comprehensive compound-specific elucidation of any natural OM (NOM) sample to date. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

DOM of water samples collected from primary sedimentation, anaerobic, anoxic, oxic and secondary sedimentation tanks in a large-scale wastewater treatment plant contained four fluorescence components: tryptophan-like (C1), tyrosine-like (C2), microbial humic-like (C3) and fulvic-like (C4) materials extracted by self-organizing map. These components showed good positive linear correlations with dissolved organic carbon of DOM. Cl and C2 were representative components in the wastewater, and they were removed to a higher extent than those of C3 and C4 in the treatment process. C2 was a latent parameter determined by CART to differentiate water samples of oxic and secondary sedimentation tanks from the successive treatment units, indirectly proving that most of tyrosine-like material was degraded by anaerobic microorganisms. Cl was an accurate parameter to comprehensively separate the samples of the five treatment units from each other, indirectly indicating that tryptophan-like material was decomposed by anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. EEM fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with self-organizing map and CART analysis can be a nondestructive effective method for characterizing structural component of DOM fractions and monitoring organic matter removal in wastewater treatment process.

A total of 78% of dissolved organic carbon was removed at an optimized dosage of 1.0 g resin in 300 mL effluent with a contact time of 60 min. DOM characterization by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy revealed that humic acid-like substances, fulvic acid-like substances, and a significant portion of soluble microbial products can be efficiently removed by the resin. Ion exchange of humic acid- and fulvic acid-like substances onto resin resulted in an increase of chloride, which can be efficiently decreased by electrolysis. A disinfection effect caused by electrolysis was found as a result of the free chlorine generated from electrolysis. Results suggested that the combination of anion exchange and electrolysis is a feasible advanced treatment of municipal sewage for DOM removal and disinfection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Taihu Lake is the third largest freshwater and a high eutrophic lake in the downstream of the Yangtze River, China. In the lake, frequent breakout of algae blooms greatly increased the concentration of different organic matters in the lake sediment. In this study, sediment samples were collected from various part of Taihu Lake to explore the spatial difference in the binding potential of DOM with Cu. The titration experiment was adopted to quantitatively characterize the interaction between Cu(II) and DOM extracted from Taihu Lake sediments using ion selective electrode (ISE) and fluorescence quenching technology. The ISE results showed that the exogenous DOM had higher binding ability than endogenous DOM, and DOM derived from aquatic macrophytes had a higher binding ability than that derived from algae. The fluorescence quenching results indicated that humic substances played a key role in the complexation between DOM and Cu(II) in the lake. However, because of the frequent breakout of algae blooms, protein-like matters are also main component like humic matters in Taihu Lake. Therefore, the metals bound by protein-like substances should be caused concern as protein-like substances in DOM were unstable and they will release bound metal when decomposed.

J	Hasumi, H; Nagata, T				Hasumi, Hiroyasu; Nagata, Toshi			Modeling the global cycle of marine dissolved organic matter and its influence on marine productivity	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A three-dimensional numerical model is developed for studies on the marine biogeochemical cycles by dealing with coupling of planktonic and microbial processes. The coupling is achieved by explicitly representing generation and consumption of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The model is applied to investigate mechanisms by which the global cycle of marine DOM influences marine productivity. Two categories, biodegradable (DOMb) and refractory (DOMr), are considered for DOM. DOMb is generated through phytoplankton exudation, zooplankton excretion, detritus decomposition, and photodissociation of DOMr. Bacteria consume DOMb and generate DOMr. After the long-term adjustment, the observed amount of DOM was reproduced from homogenous conditions of nutrients and plankton. Spatial distribution of bacterial abundance is reasonably validated against recently observed large-scale data. Sensitivity experiments indicated that: (i) over a multi-decadal timescale, contribution of DOMr to global biogeochemical cycles is negligible, (ii) the existence of DOM significantly reduces the global marine primary productivity, and (iii) DOMb originated from phytoplankton exudation is transported to subtropical regions, leading to enhanced primary productivity there as a consequence of nutrient supply associated with remineralization of transported DOMb.

Rates of DOM-mediated aldrin loss are between 2 and 56 times faster in ice than in liquid water (depending on DOM source and concentration), likely due to a freeze-concentration effect that occurs when the water freezes, providing a mechanism to concentrate reactive components into smaller, liquid-like regions within or on the ice. Rates of DOM-mediated aldrin loss are also temperature dependent, with higher rates of loss as temperature decreases. This also illustrates the importance of the freeze-concentration effect in altering reaction kinetics for processes occurring in environmental ices. All DOM source types studied were able to mediate aldrin loss, including commercially available fulvic and humic acids and an authentic Arctic snow DOM sample isolated by solid phase extraction, indicating the ubiquity of DOM in indirect photochemistry in environmental ices.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 16	2014	48	18					10725	10733		10.1021/es5023834						WOS:000341801500025	25157605	
J	Ng, TW; Chow, AT; Wong, PK				Ng, Tsz-Wai; Chow, Alex T.; Wong, Po-Keung			Dual roles of dissolved organic matter in photo-irradiated Fe(III)-contained waters	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY												A variety of reactive oxidative species (ROS) can be generated in photo-irradiated iron-dissolved organic matter (Fe-DOM) systems. The role of DOM is unclear because both photosensitizing and inhibitory effects of DOM on ROS have been observed. The present study investigated the effect of DOM on photochemical oxidation in Fe(III) contained water using Escherichia coli as a biological probe. Four different sizes and sources of DOM, including citrate, Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA), Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), and Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) were examined. Individual DOM, spiked with Fe(III) and H2O2 solutions, was inoculated with a known amount of E. coli and then was irradiated with simulated sunlight at pH 7 for 8 h. Experiments demonstrated that SRFA served as a strong photosensitizer, resulting a 5-log E. coli inactivation in the photo-irradiated Fe(III)-SRFA system. In contrast, SRHA served a strong inhibitor because no E. coli inactivation was observed in the Fe(III)-SRHA system. Both citrate and PLFA served as a weak inhibitor because their efficiencies of bacterial inactivation were slightly lower than the DOM-free system. In spite of their different inactivation efficiencies, H2O2 decomposition with comparable reaction rate constants were observed in all irradiated Fe(III)-DOM systems, suggesting H2O2 did not directly involve in the bacterial inactivation. Reactive chlorine species, generated from chloride with other reactive oxygen species, could be one of the reaction mechanisms causing bacterial inactivation because chloroform productions were observed in all treatments. Results demonstrated that DOM could either be a photosensitizer or an inhibitor in Fe(III) contained waters, probably depending on its carbonyl and carboxyl contents as well as molecular weight.

Conservative estimates for the benthic flux of DOG were 71 +/- 142 and 51 +/- 101 mg m(-2) day(-1) at hypoxic and oxic conditions, respectively. Two humic-like (Cl and C2), one tryptophan-like (C3), and one microbial humic-like (C4) components were identified from the samples using fluorescence excitation emission matrices and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). During the incubation period, C3 was removed while C4 was accumulated in the overlying water with no significant difference in the trends between the redox conditions. The humification index (HIX) increased with time. The combined results for C3, C4 and HIX suggested that microbial transformation may be an important process affecting the flux behaviors of DOM. In contrast, the overall accumulations of CDOM, C1, and C2 in the overlying water occurred only for the hypoxic condition, which was possibly explained by their enhanced photodegradation and sorption to redox-sensitive minerals under the oxic condition.

Although several studies have demonstrated the effect of thermal quenching on the fluorescence of DOM, no research has been undertaken to assess the effects of temperature by combining fluorescence excitation - emission matrices (EEM) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modelling. This study further extends previous research on thermal quenching by evaluating the impact of temperature on the fluorescence of DOM from a wide range of environmental samples, in the range 20 degrees C - 0 degrees C. Fluorescence intensity increased linearly with respect to temperature decrease at all temperatures down to 0 degrees C. Results showed that temperature affected the PARAFAC components associated with humic-like and tryptophan-like components of DOM differently, depending on the water type. The terrestrial humic-like components, C1 and C2 presented the highest thermal quenching in rural water samples and the lowest in urban water samples, while C3, the tryptophan-like component, and C4, a reprocessed humic-like component, showed opposite results. These results were attributed to the availability and abundance of the components or to the degree of exposure to the heat source. The variable thermal quenching of the humic-like components also indicated that although the PARAFAC model generated the same components across sites, the DOM composition of each component differed between them. This study has shown that thermal quenching can provide additional information on the characteristics and composition of DOM and highlighted the importance of correcting fluorescence data collected in situ.

J	Chen, ML; Jaffe, R				Chen, Meilian; Jaffe, Rudolf			Photo- and bio-reactivity patterns of dissolved organic matter from biomass and soil leachates and surface waters in a subtropical wetland	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements and optical properties were applied to assess the photo- and bio-reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from different sources, including biomass leaching, soil leaching and surface waters in a subtropical wetland ecosystem. Samples were exposed to light and/or dark incubated through controlled laboratory experiments. Changes in DOC, ultraviolet (UV-Vis) visible absorbance, and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were performed to assess sample degradation. Degradation experiments showed that while significant amounts of DOC were consumed during bio-incubation for biomass leachates, a higher degree of bio-recalcitrance for soil leachate and particularly surface waters was displayed. Photo- and bio-humification transformations were suggested for sawgrass, mangrove, and seagrass leachates, as compared to substantial photo-degradation and very little to almost no change after bio-incubation for the other samples. During photo-degradation in most cases the EEM-PARAFAC components displayed photo-decay as compared to a few cases which featured photo-production. In contrast during bio-incubation most EEM-PARAFAC components proved to be mostly bio-refractory although some increases and decreases in abundance were also observed. Furthermore, the sequential photo- followed by bio-degradation showed, with some exceptions, a "priming effect" of light exposure on the bio-degradation of DOM, and the combination of these two processes resulted in a DOM composition more similar to that of the natural surface water for the different sub-environments. In addition, for leachate samples there was a general enrichment of one of the EEM-PARAFAC humic-like component (Ex/Em: <260(305)1416 nm) during photo-degradation and an enrichment of a microbial humc-like component (Ex/Em: <260(325)1406 nm and of a tryptophan-like component (Ex/Em: 300/342 nm) during the bio-degradation process. This study exemplifies the effectiveness of optical property and EEM-PARAFAC in the assessment of DOM reactivity and highlights the importance of the coupling of photo- and bio-degradation processes in DOM degradation.

Different types of TiO2 functionalisation methods (inline functionalisation and post-functionalisation) were tested with two types of TiO2 nanoparticles. A colloidal solution consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles with average dimensions of 6 nm was prepared and the performance of these nanoparticles was compared with commercially available Degussa P25 nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of the nanofibre membranes functionalised with TiO2 was demonstrated with the degradation of the dye methylene blue. The results of photodegradation with methylene blue in aqueous solution demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles immobilised in and on the nanofibrous structure. After 2 h of UV irradiation, a degradation up to 84% methylene blue was observed. This degradation further increased and resulted in a degradation up to 99% methylene blue after 6 h of illumination. A stability test of the functional materials confirmed that the TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully incorporated in and onto the electrospun PA-6 fibres. Clean water flux was measured to find out the filter efficiency of the different membranes. The functionalised membranes have a clean water-flux varying from 1.0 x 10(4) to 2.1 x 10(4) l/m(2) h bar. As such, the electrospun nanofibre membranes functionalised with TiO2 nanoparticles show a great potential as a water filter medium with an immobilised photocatalyst in view of dissolved organic matter degradation.

Effects of Iron on Optical Properties of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Iron is a source of interference in the spectroscopic analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM); however, its effects on commonly employed ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) light adsorption and fluorescence measurements are poorly defined. Here, we describe the effects of iron(II) and iron(III) on the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence of solutions containing two DOM fractions and two surface water samples. In each case, regardless of DOM composition, UV-vis absorption increased linearly with increasing iron(III). Correction factors were derived using iron(Ill) absorption coefficients determined at wavelengths commonly used to characterize DOM. Iron(III) addition increased specific UV absorbances (SUVA) and decreased the absorption ratios (E-2:E-3) and spectral slope ratios (S-R) of DOM samples. Both iron(II) and iron(III) quenched DOM fluorescence at pH 6.7. The degree and region of fluorescence quenching varied with the iron:DOC concentration ratio, DOM composition, and pH. Regions of the fluorescence spectra associated with greater DOM conjugation were more susceptible to iron quenching, and DOM fluorescence indices were sensitive to the presence of both forms of iron. Analyses of the excitation-emission matrices using a 7- and 13-component parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model showed low PARAFAC sensitivity to iron addition.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 2	2014	48	17					10098	10106		10.1021/es502670r						WOS:000341229300021	25084347

Evidence of Incorporation of Abiotic S and N into Prairie Wetland Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												Wetlands in the prairie pothole region of North America, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world, provide many services, ranging from waterfowl habitats to pesticide attenuation to carbon sequestration. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) that occurs within these wetlands, in surface waters and sediment porewaters, was examined by molecular-level techniques. While it contains components typical of DOM from surface and subsurface waters, both sulfidic and nitrogenous organic molecules are significantly more abundant in this DOM pool than in other natural waters and show distribution patterns that exactly mimic the pattern observed for DOM that is comprised of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. This indicates that incorporation of N and S within DOM is abiotic and nonspecific, likely involving hydrogen sulfide, polysulfides, and N-containing nudeophiles.

Widespread variability in overnight patterns of ecosystem respiration linked to gradients in dissolved organic matter, residence time, and productivity in a global set of lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We characterized patterns of nighttime ecosystem respiration (ER) in 23 globally-distributed lakes using free-water changes in dissolved oxygen (DO). We considered three alternative models of ER to describe overnight changes in DO: constant ER, linearly declining ER, or logistically declining ER. Variation in ER was widespread. Each model of respiration was found to best fit observed overnight DO dynamics with some degree of frequency in every lake. Constant ER occurred with an average frequency of 62% across lakes and was most commonly the best description of DO dynamics. It never occurred with a frequency < 19% in any lake and ranged up to 90% in one dystrophic lake. The average frequency across lakes with which the linear and logistic models occurred was 21% and 17%, respectively, although they ranged as low as 3% and as high as 42% in some lakes. Although data limitations restricted the majority of our analysis to summer months, annual data records from five lakes suggest there is little seasonal variation in the frequency with which patterns occurred. As our conceptual model predicted, the frequency of constant ER among lakes increased and logistic ER decreased along a gradient of increasing terrestrial influence. However, despite significant correlations with total phosphorus and photosynthetically active radiation, the effect of lake productivity on the frequency of patterns of ER among lakes was less clear. This study suggests that diel variability in ER results from complex interactions between different components of respiration and the forcing factors that govern them.

Distinct dissolved organic matter sources induce rapid transcriptional responses in coexisting populations of Prochlorococcus, Pelagibacter and the OM60 clade	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												A considerable fraction of the Earth's organic carbon exists in dissolved form in seawater. To investigate the roles of planktonic marine microbes in the biogeochemical cycling of this dissolved organic matter (DOM), we performed controlled seawater incubation experiments and followed the responses of an oligotrophic surface water microbial assemblage to perturbations with DOM derived from an axenic culture of Prochlorococcus, or high-molecular weight DOM concentrated from nearby surface waters. The rapid transcriptional responses of both Prochlorococcus and Pelagibacter populations suggested the utilization of organic nitrogen compounds common to both DOM treatments. Along with these responses, both populations demonstrated decreases in gene transcripts associated with nitrogen stress, including those involved in ammonium acquisition. In contrast, responses from low abundance organisms of the NOR5/OM60 gammaproteobacteria were observed later in the experiment, and included elevated levels of gene transcripts associated with polysaccharide uptake and oxidation. In total, these results suggest that numerically dominant oligotrophic microbes rapidly acquire nitrogen from commonly available organic sources, and also point to an important role for carbohydrates found within the DOM pool for sustaining the less abundant microorganisms in these oligotrophic systems.

A.; Schnetger, Bernhard; Niggemann, Jutta; Simon, Meinhard; Dittmar, Thorsten			Biogeochemistry of dissolved organic matter in an anoxic intertidal creek bank	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Seawater circulation in permeable coastal sediments is driven by tidal changes in hydraulic gradients. The resulting submarine groundwater discharge is a source of nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the water column. Yet, little is known about the cycling of DOM within tidal sediments, because the molecular DOM characterization remains analytically challenging. One technique that can dissect the multitude of molecules in DOM is ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). To aim at a high resolution DOM analysis we study the seasonal turnover and marine and terrestrial sources of DOM in an intertidal creek bank of the southern North Sea down to 3 m depth and link the biogeochemical processes to FT-ICR-MS data and the analyses of inorganic porewater chemistry, delta C-13 of solid-phase extracted dissolved organic carbon (SPE-DOC), dissolved black carbon (DBC) and dissolved carbohydrates (DCHO). Increasing concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn, P, total alkalinity, dissolved nitrogen, DOC and a concomitant decrease of sulfate along the seawater circulation path from the upper tidal flat to the tidal flat margin indicate continuous microbial activity. The relative increase of Si concentrations, unsaturated aliphatics, peptide molecular formulae and isotopically more C-13-enriched SPE-DOC towards the tidal flat margin suggests that remineralization processes mobilize DOM from buried algal (diatoms) and microbial biomass. Porewater in sediments <100 cm depth contains C-13-depleted SPE-DOC and highly unsaturated compounds which are probably derived from eroded peats, suggesting rapid removal of bioavailable marine DOM such as DCHO from the water column and selective enrichment of terrestrial DOM. DBC concentrations are highest in the discharging porewater close to the tidal creek suggesting that the intertidal flat is an important DBC source to the coastal ocean. Porewater DOM accumulating at the low water line is enriched in N and S. We hypothesize that this is partly due to DOM reacting with dissolved sulfide and ammonium which may increase the refractory character of the DOM, hence making it less bioavailable for in situ active microbes.

Two parameters, the ratios of absorbance and dissolved organic carbon at 254 degrees nm (SUVA(254)) and the integral area from 240 degrees nm to 400 degrees nm (A(240-400)), were used to assess the molecular weight and aromaticity of DOM. The surface sediments showed a relatively low aromaticity of DOM due to the impact of environmental pollution. Synchronous fluorescence spectra showed an extremely high fraction of the protein-like region (PLR). Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation -emission matrix spectra revealed four fluorescent components occurring in sediment DOM: two humic-like (C1 and C2) components and two protein-like (C3 and C4) components. The PARAFAC-PCA displayed three PCA factors (factors 1,2 and 3) which accounted for 48.250%, 25.927% and 25.391%, respectively, of the variance in fluorescent component. The humic-like components 1 and 2 concurrently showed positive factor 1 loadings. Factor 2 was mainly explained by the tryptophan-like component C3. A non-humic component 4, having a low factor loading in the other two factors, showed an extremely high factor 3 loading. The EEM -PARAFAC-PCA showed varying contributions of terrestrial versus autochthonous DOM sources in lake sediments. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

To investigate the characteristics of DOM in Huangpu River (the last tributary of the Yangtze River), surface water samples were collected along the river from December 2011 to June, 2013. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the absorbance and fluorescence spectrum of DOM in water samples were measured. Fluorescent DOM in the Huangpu River was decomposed into four components by the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), including one humic-like substance and three protein-like substances. It showed that high spatial variability of DOC concentration was observed in the upstream water compared to the downstream water, and so did the absorbance coefficients of chromophoric dissolved organic matter and the total fluorescence intensities of different PARAFAC components of DOM. Furthermore, there was a large difference between the polarity and bioavailability of DOM in the Huangpu River. Polar compounds dominated tyrosine-like component of fluorescent DOM in all seasons. Tryptophan-like and humic-like substances had more polar fraction in summer and autumn than those in winter, while aromatic protein-like materials had the highest polar fraction in winter. Almost all of fluorescent DOM components were refractory in spring, while less than 20% of fluorescent DOM in average were biodegradable within 4 weeks in other seasons. We concluded that the spatial variation in the abundance of DOM in the Huangpu River is mainly affected by the water discharges from the Hangjiahu Plain and the seasonal difference in polarity and bioavailability of DOM is largely determined by its origins.

The seasonal dynamics of the CDOM light absorption coefficients at 440 nm (a(cdom)(440)) is essentially characterized by (i) subsurface maxima forming in spring and progressively reinforcing throughout summer, (ii) impoverishment in the surface layer throughout summer and (iii) vertical homogeneity in winter. Seasonal variations of the spectral dependence of CDOM absorption, as described by the exponential slope value (S-cdom), are characterized by highest values in summer and autumn at the surface and low values at the depths of a(cdom)(440) subsurface maxima or just below them. Variations of a(cdom)(440) are likely controlled by microbial digestion of phytoplankton cells, which leads to CDOM production, and by photochemical destruction (photobleaching), which leads to CDOM degradation. Photobleaching is also the main driver of S-cdom variations. Consistently with previous observations, a(cdom)(440) for a given chlorophyll a concentration is higher than expected from Case I waters bio-optical models. The total non-water light absorption budget shows that surface waters at the BOUSSOLE site are largely dominated by CDOM during all seasons but the algal bloom in March and April. These results improve the knowledge of CDOM absorption dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea, which is scarcely documented. In addition, they open the way to improved algorithms for the retrieval of CDOM absorption from field or satellite radiometric measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, physical and chemical characteristics of DOM in Kushiro river, and its territory (Eastern Hokkaido, Japan) were analyzed using multiple analytical tools. Multiple samples were collected from diverse locations (Kushiro river, Kushiro wetland, compost fertilizer, forest and treated sewage) and compared them against their DOM characteristics. Among the samples, Kushiro wetland samples presented higher specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) values demonstrating DOM derived from vascular plants which are rich in aromatic-components. The SUVA values of the two samples of the Kushiro river were relatively close to those of the wetland samples implying the fact that the river contains high amount of plant derived aromatic DOM compounds, originating from the wetland. The excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence results showed that generally all water samples have two peaks namely, A and C. These two peaks are related to humic-like substance typically derived from the breakdown of organic matters. The excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence results of the river samples were also similar to those of the wetland samples, characterized by no appearance of protein, amino acid, polysaccharide, and fluvic like matter, but more pronounced to the aromatic component rich humic acid. Principal component analysis revealed that approximately 88% of the variance in the DOM characteristics might be explained by the type of different sources. From the loadings on PC1 and PC2 in the scores plot, the properties of the DOM of the wetland appeared to be similar to those of the river DOM. Combined results exhibited that the quality of the Kushiro river water is fundamentally inherited from the Kushiro wetland, and the main structure of the river water is characterized by poly-aromatic humic like matter and higher molecular weight.

Watershed Glacier Coverage Influences Dissolved Organic Matter Biogeochemistry in Coastal Watersheds of Southeast Alaska	ECOSYSTEMS												The Coast Mountains of southeast Alaska are currently experiencing some of the highest rates of glacier volume loss on Earth, with unknown implications for proglacial stream biogeochemistry. We analyzed streamwater for delta O-18 and dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry (concentration, delta C-13-dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and fluorescence characterization) during the 2012 glacial runoff season from three coastal watersheds in southeast Alaska that ranged in glacier coverage from 0 to 49% and a glacier outflow stream. Our goal was to assess how DOM biogeochemistry may change as receding glaciers are replaced by forests and glaciers contribute less meltwater to streamflow. Discharge and streamwater delta O-18 varied seasonally reflecting varying contributions of rainfall and snow/icemelt to streamflow over the runoff season. Mean DOC concentrations were lowest in the glacial outflow and highest in the non-glacial stream reflecting an increasing contribution of vascular plant-derived carbon with decreasing watershed glaciation. Fluorescence and delta C-13-DOC signatures indicated that DOM shifted from vascular plant-derived, humic-like material in the non-glacial stream toward more delta C-13-DOC enriched, glacier-derived DOM in the glacial outflow. Streamwater delta O-18 was significantly correlated to DOC concentration, delta C-13-DOC, and protein-like fluorescence of streamwater DOM (all P < 0.05), demonstrating that changes in the source of streamwater across the glacial watershed continuum have important implications for the amount and quality of stream DOM export. Overall, our findings show that continued glacial recession and subsequent changes in glacial runoff could substantially influence the biogeochemistry of coastal temperature watersheds by altering the timing, magnitude, and chemical signature of DOM delivered to streams.

This study investigated the content and composition of DOM and its fractions in sediments, as well as the relationship between the different parameters and nitrogen (N) forms in DOM. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the compositional characteristics of DOM, hydrophobic bases (HOB), hydrophobic acids (HOA), hydrophobic neutral fractions (HON), and hydrophilic matter (HIM) in sediments from Erhai Lake, China. Seven surface sediment samples with different environmental characteristics were collected. The DOM in the sediment was fractionated into HOB, HOA, HON, and HIM using XAD-8 resin based on compound hydrophobicity. The contents of DOM and its fractions were measured using a TOC analyzer. The structural characteristics of DOM and its fractions were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy and UV-Vis absorbance. Correlation analyses were carried out to better understand the relationships between the parameters of the spectral characteristics and the contents of the different N forms in DOM and its fractions. The content, spatial distribution and structure of DOM and its fractions in Erhai Lake sediment were affected by water depth and aquatic plants. The DOM content in sediment ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 g kg(-1). HON accounted for 41.3 to 85.7 % of DOM, whereas HIM constituted 15.0 to 58.7 % and was significantly negatively correlated with HON (R (2) = 0.856, P < 0.01). HIM was more dominant than the hydrophobic matter in the southern site, but was less abundant in the north and central sites. Sediment DOM and its fractions comprised protein- and humic-like substances. The HOA and HIM comprised humic-like substances, which were the most abundant in the southern site. (1) Hydrophobic fractions are the major components of DOM in the sediments from the seven sites in Erhai Lake. (2) DOM and its fractions mainly originated from microbial sources. (3) The A (253)/A (203) ratio is useful for evaluating the contents of N forms. The structure of DOM and its fractions are important in affecting the contents of DON. Nitrate (NO3-N) contributes to eutrophication, and thus cannot be ignored from studies of Erhai Lake sediment.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				SEP	2014	14	9					1599	1611		10.1007/s11368-014-0916-2						WOS:000340530300009		
J	Verheyen, L; Versieren, L; Smolders, E				Verheyen, Liesbeth; Versieren, Liske; Smolders, Erik			Natural dissolved organic matter mobilizes Cd but does not affect the Cd uptake by the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Korschikov) in resin buffered solutions	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) can have contrasting effects on metal bioaccumulation in algae because of complexation reactions that reduce free metal ion concentrations and because of DOM adsorption to algal surfaces which promote metal adsorption. This study was set up to reveal the role of different natural DOM samples on cadmium (Cd) uptake by the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Korschikov). Six different DOM samples were collected from natural freshwater systems and isolated by reverse osmosis. In addition, one C-13 enriched DOM sample was isolated from soil to trace DOM adsorption to algae. Algae were exposed to standardized solutions with or without these DOM samples, each exposed at equal DOM concentrations and at equal non-toxic Cd2+ activity (similar to 4 nM) that was buffered with a resin. The DOM increased total dissolved Cd by factors 3-16 due to complexation reactions at equal Cd2+ activity. In contrast, the Cd uptake was unaffected by DOM or increased maximally 1.6 fold (C-13 enriched DOM). The C-13 analysis revealed that maximally 6% of algal C was derived from DOM and that this can explain the small increase in biomass Cd. It is concluded that free Cd2+ and not DOM-complexed Cd is the main bioavailable form of Cd when solution Cd2+ is well buffered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Grzybowski, W; Szydlowski, J				Grzybowski, Waldemar; Szydlowski, Jerzy			The impact of chromophoric dissolved organic matter on the photodegradation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in natural waters	CHEMOSPHERE												17 alpha-Ethinylestradiol (EE2), the potent estrogen which forms the basic constituent of the contraceptive pill, can undergo degradation in natural waters by sunlight and via secondary reactions initiated by photo-excited dissolved organic matter. The current paper presents the findings of an investigation into the irradiation process of EE2 when dissolved in natural waters. This investigation was carried out under simulated sunlight in samples of sea, river and distilled water at a 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol concentration of 300 ng L-1. Several notes of significance may be made on the basis of these results. Firstly, an enhancement of the degradation, observed in the presence of co-absorbing dissolved organic matter, was shown to be proportional to the absorbance of the sample. Secondly, the kinetics of the process obtained during this investigation were within the range of previously reported findings, despite the fact that significantly higher concentrations of EE2 were used in earlier studies. Finally, the environmental half-life times for 17 alpha-ethynyloestradiol, calculated from the results of the experiments, were found to be one and two days in the top layer of river and sea water respectively.

The effects of different number of components and constraints on the stability of the proposed models are compared. MCR-ALS is shown to be an effective way to characterize and resolve DOM sources in natural fresh water systems from EEM data, with good correlation with experimentally measured DOM concentration values. MATLAB georeferenced mapping is used to illustrate the geographical distribution of resolved DOM contributions. MCR-ALS resolved EEM spectra are used to recognize the corresponding chemical groups assigned to possible DOM sources. Relationships between human activities and the environmental situation of the river system are discussed from these possible DOM sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Soil samples were collected at different depths from three (Ap, 2AB and 2Bt) and eight (A1, A2, A3, E1, E2, 2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3) soil horizons of two Alfisols located in the south (PR1) and north (PR2) of Italy, with a clay texture and a silt loam to loam ones, respectively. Chemical and spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the HAs and the DOM isolated from different soil horizons, including Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and Fluorescence spectroscopies. The HAs and the DOM isolated from the two Alfisols apparently showed significant differences in their compositional, structural and functional characteristics. In particular, the HAs isolated from the PR1 featured a higher degree of humification and molecular complexity with respect to those isolated from the PR2. On the contrary, the DOM samples isolated from the PR2 showed a more marked aromatic character and polycondensation degree. Both the HAs and the DOM obtained from the PR1 presented a greater qualitative homogeneity with respect to those obtained from the PR2. These results could be reasonably ascribed to the different texture and horizons of the two Alfisols, and to a greater pedogenesis occurred in the PR1. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) and high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques, this study compared the binding characteristics of organic ligands to Al(III) in dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils under short-term (3-years) and long-term (22-years) fertilizations. Three fertilization treatments were examined: (i) no fertilization (Control), (ii) chemical nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK), and (iii) NPK plus swine manure (NPKM). Soil spectra detected by the 2DCOS Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that fertilization modified the binding characteristics of organic ligands to Al(III) in soil DOM at both short- and long- term location sites. The CH deformations in aliphatic groups played an important role in binding to Al(III) but with minor differences among the Control, NPK and NPKM at the short-term site. While at the long-term site both C-O stretching of polysaccharides or polysaccharide-like substances and aliphatic O-H were bound to Al(III) under the Control, whereas only aliphatic O-H, and only polysaccharides and silicates, were bound to Al(III) under NPK and NPKM, respectively. Images from HRTEM demonstrated that crystalline nanominerals, composed of Fe and O, were predominant in soil DOM under NPK, while amorphous nanominerals, predominant in Al, Si, and O, were dominant in soil DOM under Control and NPKM. In conclusion, fertilization strategies, especially under long-term, could affect the binding of organic ligands to Al(III) in soil DOM, which resulted in alterations in the turnover, reactivity, and bioavailability of soil organic matter. Our results demonstrated that the FTIR-2DCOS combined with HRTEM techniques could enhance our understanding in the binding characteristics of DOM to Al(III) and the resulted nanominerals in soils.

J	Hur, J; Lee, BM; Shin, KH				Hur, Jin; Lee, Bo-Mi; Shin, Kyung-Hoon			Spectroscopic characterization of dissolved organic matter isolates from sediments and the association with phenanthrene binding affinity	CHEMOSPHERE												In this study, selected spectroscopic characteristics of sediment organic matter (SOM) were compared and discussed with respect to their different isolation methods, the source discrimination capabilities, and the association with the extent of phenanthrene binding. A total of 16 sediments were collected from three categorized locations including a costal lake, industrial areas, and upper streams, each of which is likely influenced by the organic sources of algal production, industrial effluent, and terrestrial input, respectively. The spectroscopic properties related to aromatic structures and terrestrial humic acids were more pronounced for alkaline extractable organic matter (AEOM) isolates than for the SOM isolates based on water soluble extracts and pore water. The three categorized sampling locations were the most differentiated in the AEOM isolates, suggesting AEOM may be the most representative SOM isolates in terms of describing the chemical properties and the organic sources of SOM. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) based on fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) showed that a combination of three fluorescent groups could represent all the fluorescence features of SOM. The three categorized sampling locations were well discriminated by the percent distributions of humic-like fluorescent groups of the AEOM isolates. The relative distribution of terrestrial humic-like fluorophores was well correlated with the extent of phenanthrene binding (r = 0.571; p < 0.05), suggesting that the presence of humic acids in SOM may contribute to the enhancement of binding with hydrophobic organic contaminants in sediments. Principal component analysis (PCA) further demonstrated that the extent of SOM's binding affinity might be affected by the degree of biogeochemical transformation in SOM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To identify the source of DOM and to better understand its chemical and structural properties, we collected 33 soil samples from zones with fluctuating water levels along the major rivers on Chongming Island, evaluated the DOM contents in riparian soil, analyzed the chemical composition and functional groups and traced DOM origins by using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) combined with clustering analysis. All sampling sites were divided into four groups by principal component analysis (PCA) on the basis of the DOM molecules. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the DOM contents between every two groups; however, the DOM fractions differed significantly among the different site groups in the following order: Sigma lipids and Sigma proteins > Sigma sugars and Sigma fatty acids > Sigma amino acids, Sigma indoles and Sigma alkaloids. DOM in the riparian buffer zones originated from riparian plants, domestic sewage and agricultural activities, and the hydrophobic and amphiphilic fractions accounting for over 60% of the identified molecules were the dominant fractions. Our study has confirmed the heterogeneous properties of DOM, and it is of vital importance to isolate and characterize the various DOM fractions at the molecular level for a better understanding of the behavior and roles of DOM in the natural environment.

A novel approach to study composition of in situ produced root-derived dissolved organic matter	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Carbon (C) compounds released from plant roots comprise a significant and reactive fraction of belowground C pools. These root-derived compounds modify rhizosphere soil and play a vital role in the mobility of nutrients and contaminants within ecosystems. Due to their low concentration, fast turnover, and limited spatial distribution throughout the soil, root-derived compounds are difficult to study. This study combined a C-13 pulse-chase technique and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy techniques to analyze root-derived compounds produced in real soil. The pulsed samples displayed distinct enrichment in aliphatic and carbohydrate-type compounds indicating that pulse-chase approaches are a viable technique for isolating root-derived from background DOM. However, multiple NMR techniques may be necessary to develop a full profile of root-derived DOM. This is the first use of combined pulse-chase-NMR methodologies to analyze in situ produced root-derived DOM. Such a combination is applicable to various experimental designs and/or environmental scenarios, and can provide valuable information for future rhizosphere science. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Does anoxic processing of dissolved organic matter affect organic-mineral interactions in paddy soils?	GEODERMA												Adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil relates closely to hydrous Fe oxides, being one of the most important adsorbents. In paddy soils, reductive dissolution of hydrous Fe oxides may reduce the capacity of topsoils to retain organic matter. Dissolved organic matter produced and processed under anoxic conditions in the topsoils, thus, is leached into deeper soil horizons that still have considerable amounts of hydrous Fe oxides. Yet, the effect of the anoxic processing on adsorption of the leached DOM in oxic subsoil horizons is not known. We tested the adsorption of DOM from oxic and anoxic solution to minerals typical for paddy subsoils (goethite, ferrihydrite, ferruginous smectite). Adsorption of organic carbon (OC) to hydrous Fe oxides was up to five times larger for oxic than anoxic solutions. Ferruginous smectite adsorbed less DC than hydrous Fe oxides and differences between oxic and anoxic solutions were less pronounced than for the hydrous Fe oxides. Phosphate contained in the DOM test solution adsorbed strongly to the Fe oxide surfaces, while little to no phosphate was adsorbed by the smectite. Phosphate adsorption to hydrous Fe oxides was not affected by redox conditions. That finding is in line with the largely invariable equilibrium pH, suggesting no changes in number and reactivity of sorption sites at the hydrous oxides' surfaces. Also, we found no indications of reductive dissolution of minerals during the experiments. The reduction in DOM sorption, thus, seems to be due to compositional changes of DOM during anoxic processing. (C) 2013 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

Investigating the impact of the DOM that influences those reduction processes is crucial for understanding and predicting the geochemical fate of these environmental species. This study investigated the impact of different molecular weight DOM fractions (DMWDs) on the 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) reduction by S. putrefaciens 200 (SP200) and alpha-Fe2O3 with lactate (excluding electron donor interference). Kinetic measurements demonstrated that 2-NP reduction rates were affected by the redox reactivity of active species under DMWDs (denoted as L-DOM, M-DOM, and H-DOM). The enhanced reduction rates are consistent with the negative shifts in peak oxidation potential values, the increases in HA-like/FA-like values, aromaticity index values and electron transfer capacity values. L-DOM acted mainly as ligands to complex Fe(II), whereas the significant role of H-DOM in reductive reactions should be acting as an electron shuttle, transferring electrons from SP200 to Fe(III) and 2-NP and from biogenic Fe(II) to 2-NP, further accelerating the 2-NP reductions. Those observations provide valuable insights into the role of DOM in the biogeochemical redox processes and the remediation of contaminated soil in a natural environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometric differentiation of dissolved organic matter isolated by coupled reverse osmosis-electrodialysis from various major oceanic water masses	MARINE CHEMISTRY												A high-recovery technique of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolation - reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis (RO/ED) - was used to isolate DOM from the North Atlantic Senegal-Mauritanian upwelling area surface water (5 m), North Atlantic oxygen minimum water (415 m) and deep water (3000 m), North Pacific subtropical gyre surface water (5 m), and North Pacific intermediate water (674 m) and deep water (3500 m). Samples were characterized by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (ES! FTICR-MS). RO/ED isolated DOM samples share a significant number of common formulas accounting for 54-79% of formulas in each sample. Total dissolved carbohydrate (TCHO) concentrations in RO/ED isolated DOM were specifically measured using a colorimetric method, and were found to have higher contribution to DOC than estimated by FTICR-MS data. Percentages of TCHO-C in DOC are in the range of 3.7-19.6% in all samples, with the North Pacific deep (3500 m) water having the lowest % and the North Atlantic upwelling core surface water having the highest %. Principal component analysis (PCA) using the relative magnitudes of MS peaks facilitated identification of specific peaks that are enriched in different samples. Peaks enriched in surface samples have higher H/C values than peaks enriched in deep samples, in both the North Atlantic DOM and the North Pacific DOM. This enrichment pattern is likely due to the selective photo-degradation of aromatic compounds and the bio-production of aliphatic and carbohydrate-like compounds in surface waters, and the selective bio-degradation of aliphatic and carbohydrate-like compounds with increasing depth. In further support of a photo-degraded signature for DOM in surface waters, photo-resistant and photo-produced molecular formulas were present in the highest numbers in the surface North Pacific subtropical gyre DOM. Peaks enriched in the North Pacific intermediate and deep DOM have significantly higher O/C values than the North Atlantic oxygen minimum layer and deep DOM, for both CHO formula compounds and CHON formula compounds. This difference in O/C values observed for the deep Pacific vs. Atlantic suggests oxidation of DOM, possibly via microbial activity during the ageing of DOM or the preferential remineralization of DOM from sinking particles at depth in the Pacific.

Interactions of Dissolved Organic Matter with Natural and Engineered Inorganic Colloids: A Review	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This contribution critically reviews the state of knowledge on interactions of natural colloids and engineered nanoparticles with natural dissolved organic materials (DOM). These interactions determine the behavior and impact of colloids in natural system. Humic substances, polysaccharides, and proteins present in natural waters adsorb onto the surface of most colloids. We outline major adsorption mechanisms and structures of adsorption layers reported in the literature and discuss their generality on the basis of particle type, DOM type, and media composition. Advanced characterization methods of both DOM and colloids are needed to address insufficiently understood aspects as DOM fractionation upon adsorption, adsorption reversibility, and effect of capping agent. Precise knowledge on adsorption layer helps in predicting the colloidal stability of the sorbent. While humic substances tend to decrease aggregation and deposition through electrostatic and steric effects, bridging-flocculation can occur in the presence of multivalent cations. In the presence of DOM, aggregation may become reversible and aggregate structure dynamic. Nonetheless, the role of shear forces is still poorly understood. If traditional approaches based on the DLVO-theory can be useful in specific cases, quantitative aggregation models taking into account DOM dynamics, bridging, and disaggregation are needed for a comprehensive modeling of colloids stability in natural media.

SDOM from different locations and soil depths all exhibited similar AQY(CO) spectra irrespective of soil age. AQY(CO) increased by 68% for a 20 degrees C warming, decreased by 25% from ionic strength 0 to 0.7 mol L-1, and dropped by 25-38% from pH 4 to 8. These effects combined together could reduce AQY(CO) by up to 72% when SDOM transits from terrestrial environemnts to open-ocean conditions during summer in the Arctic. A Michaelis-Menten kinetics characterized the influence of SDOM dilution on AQY(CO) with a very low substrate half-saturation concentration. Generalized global-scale relationships between AQY(CO) and salinity and absorbance demostrate that the CO-based photoreactivity of ancient permaforst SDOM is comparable to that of modern riverine DOM and that the effects of the physicochemical account for the seaward decline of AQY(CO) observed in diverse estuarine and coastal water bodies. variables revealed here alone could				Guo, Laodong/F-6045-2010	Guo, Laodong/0000-0002-5010-1630												0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 19	2014	48	16					9113	9121		10.1021/es502057n						WOS:000340701800023	25029258

Here, we continue to use the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) technique coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling, measurements of bulk organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), oil indices, and other optical properties to examine the chemical evolution and transformation of oil components derived from the DWH in the water column of the GOM. Seawater samples were collected from the GOM during July 2012, 2 years after the oil spill. This study shows that, while dissolved organic carbon (DOC) values have decreased since just after the DWH spill, they remain higher at some stations than typical deep-water values for the GOM. Moreover, we continue to observe fluorescent DOM components in deep waters, similar to those of degraded oil observed in lab and field experiments, which suggest that oil-related fluorescence signatures, as part of the DOM pool, have persisted for 2 years in the deep waters. This supports the notion that some oil-derived chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) components could still be identified in deep waters after 2 years of degradation, which is further supported by the lower DIC and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) associated with greater amounts of these oil-derived components in deep waters, assuming microbial activity on DOM in the current water masses is only the controlling factor of DIC and pCO(2) concentrations.

DOM adsorption to positively charged amine-terminated SAMs resulted in the formation of water-rich adlayers with nanometer thicknesses that were relatively rigid, irreversibly adsorbed, and collapsed upon air drying, as demonstrated by combined quartz crystal microbalance and ellipsometry measurements. DOM adlayer thicknesses varied only slightly with solution pH from 5 to 8 but increased markedly with increasing ionic strength. Contact angle measurements revealed that the DOM adlayers were relatively polar, likely due to the high water contents of the adlayers. Comparing DOM adsorption to SAM-coated sensors that systematically differed in surface charge and polarity characteristics showed that electrostatics dominated DOM surface interactions. Laccase adsorption to DOM adlayers on amine-terminated SAMs served to demonstrate the applicability of the presented experimental approach to study the interactions of (bio)macromolecules and (nano)particles with DOM.

J	Zhang, YL; Huang, W; Ran, Y; Mao, JD				Zhang, Yulong; Huang, Wen; Ran, Yong; Mao, Jingdong			Compositions and constituents of freshwater dissolved organic matter isolated by reverse osmosis	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from riverine and lacustrine water was isolated using a reverse osmosis (RO) system. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) was used to quantitatively evaluate the compositions and constituents of DOM, which are compared with previous investigations on marine DOM. Results indicated that concentration factor (CF) was a key metric controlling yield and sorption of DOM on the RO system. The sorption was likely non-selective, based on the C-13 NMR and delta C-13 analyses. Carbohydrates and lipids accounted for 25.0-41.5% and 30.2-46.3% of the identifiable DOM, followed by proteins (18.2-19.8%) and lignin (7.17-12.8%). The freshwater DOM contained much higher alkyl and aromatic C but lower alkoxyl and carboxyl C than marine DOM. The structural difference was not completely accounted for by using structure of high molecular weight (HMW) DOM, suggesting a size change involved in transformations of DOM during the transport from rivers to oceans.

Effects of oligomerization phenomenon on dissolved organic matter removal kinetics on novel activated carbons	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												The overall objective of this research was to determine the effects of oxidative coupling (oligomerization) phenomenon on the adsorption kinetics of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) on novel tailored activated carbons. A comparison of adsorption kinetics data collected in the presence and absence of phenolic compounds under both oxic (presence of molecular oxygen) and anoxic (absence of molecular oxygen) conditions showed that the adsorption rate of DOM was strongly affected by the oligomerization phenomenon. The diffusion rate of DOM is in inverse proportion to the critical oxidation potential of the phenolic compound. In addition, the roles of carbon physicochemical characteristics and DOM molecular weight distribution were also investigated. Tailored activated carbon impregnated with manganese oxide was found to play an important role in promoting complexation reactions between DOM and phenolic compounds. Meanwhile, Fulvic acid molecules (component of DOM) with molecular weight below 2000 Da appeared to have more potential to get influenced from oligomerization effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Owing to the complex interplay of multiple factors, the oxidation-reduction (redox) properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from green manure crops are presently not fully understood. In this study, a variety of surrogate parameters were used to evaluate the redox capacity and redox state of DOM derived from Chinese milk vetch (CMV, Astragalus sinicus L.) via microbial decomposition under continuously flooded (CF) and non-flooded (NF) conditions. Additionally, the correlation between the surrogate parameters of CMV-DOM and the kinetic parameters of relevant redox reactions was evaluated in a soil-water system containing CMV-DOM. Results showed that the redox properties of CMV-DOM were substantially different between the fresh and decomposed CMV-DOM treatments. Determination of the surrogate parameters via ultraviolet-visible/Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography generally provided high-quality data for predicting the redox capacity of CMV-DOM, while the surrogate parameters determined by elemental analysis were suitable for predicting the redox state of CMV-DOM. Depending on the redox capacity and redox state of various moieties/components, NF-decomposed CMV-DOM could easily accelerate soil reduction by shuttling electrons to iron oxides, because it contained more reversible redox-active functional groups (e.g. quinone and hydroquinone pairs) than CF-decomposed CMV-DOM. This work demonstrates that a single index cannot interpret complex changes in multiple factors that jointly determine the redox reactivity of CMV-DOM. Thus, a multi-parametric study is needed for providing comprehensive information on the redox properties of green manure DOM.

A coupled geochemical and biogeochemical approach to characterize the bioreactivity of dissolved organic matter from a headwater stream	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The bioreactivity or susceptibility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to microbial degradation in streams and rivers is of critical importance to global change studies, but a comprehensive understanding of DOM bioreactivity has been elusive due, in part, to the stunningly diverse assemblages of organic molecules within DOM. We approach this problem by employing a range of techniques to characterize DOM as it flows through biofilm reactors: dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs), and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. The EEMs and mass spectral data were analyzed using a combination of multivariate statistical approaches. We found that 45% of stream water DOC was biodegraded by microorganisms, including 31-45% of the humic DOC. This bioreactive DOM separated into two different groups: (1) H/C centered at 1.5 with O/C 0.1-0.5 or (2) low H/C of 0.5-1.0 spanning O/C 0.2-0.7 that were positively correlated (Spearman ranking) with chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM, respectively). DOM that was more recalcitrant and resistant to microbial degradation aligned tightly in the center of the van Krevelen space (H/C 1.0-1.5, O/C 0.25-0.6) and negatively correlated (Spearman ranking) with CDOM and FDOM. These findings were supported further by principal component analysis and 2-D correlation analysis of the relative magnitudes of the mass spectral peaks assigned to molecular formulas. This study demonstrates that our approach of processing stream water through bioreactors followed by EEMs and FTICR-MS analyses, in combination with multivariate statistical analysis, allows for precise, robust characterization of compound bioreactivity and associated molecular level composition.

The three indices, SUVA(280) and two spectral slopes (S275-295 and S350-400), were used to detect the change in the aromatic structure of DOM. DOM aromaticity was lower at sites W1 and W3, where industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and agricultural drainage, contributed respectively. The humification index also indicated a low humification degree at sites W1 and W3, and high humification degree in other sites with relatively better water quality. Fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analysis has been used to quantitatively analyse fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra. The results showed that external contaminants can influence the distribution of P-i,P-n values from the FRI analysis. Serious pollution area obtained a relatively high P-p value. A significant negative correlation between P-h/P-p and f(450/500) indicated the terrestrial or autochthonous sources of DOM. Therefore, the spectroscopic techniques combined with regional integration analysis can be used as a useful tool for investigating and assessing the lake ecological environment.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				AUG	2014	42	8					1076	1082		10.1002/clen.201300412						WOS:000342339600007

DOMs in two typical DBEs were fractionized using DAX-8/XAD-4 resin and ultrafiltration membranes. The hydrophilic fractions and the low molecular weight (MW) (<3 kDa) DOM fractions constituted a major portion (>50%) of DOMs for the two effluents. The hydrophilic and low MW fractions of both effluents were the greatest contributors of specific UV254 absorbance (SUVA(254)), and the SUVA(254) of DOM fractions decreased with hydrophobicity and MW. Two DBEs exhibited acute and chronic biotoxicities. Both acute and chronic toxicities of DOM fractions increased linearly with the increase of SUVA(254) value. Kinetics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal via NDMP treatment was performed by comparing it with that of particle active carbon (PAC). Results indicated that the removal of DOC from DBEs via NDMP was 60%, whereas DOC removals by PAC were lower than 15%. Acidic organics could be significantly removed with the use of NDMP. DOM with large MW in DBE could be removed significantly by using the same means. Removal efficiency of NDMP for DOM decreased with the decrease of MW. Compared with PAC, NDMP could significantly reduce the acute and chronic bio-toxicities of DBEs. NaCl/NaOH mixture regenerants, with selected concentrations of 10% NaCl (m/m)/1% NaOH (m/m), could improve desorption efficiency.

The absorption coefficient of CDOM at 350 nm (a(350)) in surface water ranged from 1.00 to 1.83 m(-1) (mean: 1.35 m(-1)) in May 2011 and from 0.78 to 1.92 m(-1) (mean: 1.19 m(-1)) in April 2012. Little surface-bottom difference was observed due to strong vertical mixing. The a(350) was weakly anti-correlated to salinity but positively correlated to chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. A shoulder over 260-290 nm, suggestive of biogenic molecules, superimposed the overall pattern of exponentially decreasing CDOM absorption with wavelength. The wavelength distribution of the absorption spectral slope manifested a pronounced peak at ca. 300 nm characteristic of algal-derived CDOM. All a(250)/a(365) ratios exceeded 6, corresponding to CDOM molecular weights (M-w) of less than 1 kDa. Spectroscopically, CDOM in the Bohai Bay differed substantively from that in the Haihe River, the bay's dominant source of land runoff; photobleaching of the riverine CDOM enlarged the difference. Results point to marine biological production being the principal source of CDOM in the Bohai Bay during the sampling seasons. Relatively low runoff, fast dilution, and selective photodegradation are postulated to be among the overarching elements responsible for the lack of terrigenous CDOM signature in the bay water.

The abundance and aromaticity of the chromophoric DOM increased over the 25-d mesocosm experiment. The BPA freely dissolved concentration was 72.3% lower and the chloramphenicol freely dissolved concentration was 56.2% lower using DOM collected on day 25 than using DOM collected on day 1 of the mesocosm experiment. The freely dissolved concentrations negatively correlated with the ultraviolent absorption coefficient at 254 nm and positively correlated with the spectral slope of chromophoric DOM, suggesting that the bioavailability of these emerging organic contaminants depends on the characteristics of the DOM present. The DOM-water partition coefficients (logK(OC)) for the emerging organic contaminants positively correlated with the aromaticity of the DOM, measured as humic acid-like fluorescent components C1 (excitation/emission=250[313]/412 nm) and C2 (excitation/emission =268[379]/456 nm). The authors conclude that the bioavailability of emerging organic contaminants in eutrophic lakes can be affected by changes in the DOM.

The species was exposed to increasing free zinc (1.34x10(-7)M-3.98x10(-6)M) or lead (5.13x10(-9)M-1.82x10(-7)M) concentra-tions. Low metal levels ([Zn2+]=1.34x10(-7)M; [Pb2+]=5.13x10(-9)M) had no effect on cell growth. Toxic effects were observed from higher metal contamination ([Zn2+]=3.98x10(-6)M; [Pb2+]=6.54x10(-8)M), as a conversion of vegetative cells into cysts. Analysis of the released FDOM by three-dimensional (3-D) fluorescence spectroscopy was achieved, using the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The PARAFAC modeling revealed four components associated with two contributions: one related to the biological activity; the other linked to the organic matter decomposition in the culture medium. The C1 component combined a tryptophan peak and characteristics of humic substances, whereas the C2 component was considered as a tryptophan protein fluorophore. The two others C3 and C4 components were associated with marine organic matter production. Relea-sed fluorescent substances were induced by low ([Zn2+]=1.34x10(-7)M; [Pb2+]=5.13x10(-9)M) and moderate([Zn2+]=6.21x10(-7)M; [Pb2+]=2.64x10(-9)M) metal concentrations, suggesting the activation of cellular mechanisms in response to metal stress, to exudate FDOM that could complex metal cations and reduce their toxicity toward A.catenella cells.

J	Toosi, ER; Schmidt, JP; Castellano, MJ				Toosi, Ehsan R.; Schmidt, John P.; Castellano, Michael J.			Land use and hydrologic flowpaths interact to affect dissolved organic matter and nitrate dynamics	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The transport and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) through the soil profile impact down-gradient ecosystems and are increasingly recognized as important factors affecting the balance between accumulation and mineralization of subsoil organic matter. Using zero tension and tension lysimeters at three soil depths (20, 40, 60 cm) in paired forest and maize/soybean land uses, we compared dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved organic N (DON) and DIN concentrations as well as DOM properties including hydrophilic-C (HPI-C), UV absorption (SUVA(254)), humification index and C/N ratio. Soil moisture data collected at lysimeter locations suggest zero tension lysimeters sampled relatively rapid hydrologic flowpaths that included downward saturated flow through the soil matrix and/or rapid macropore flow that is not in equilibrium with bulk soil solution whereas tension lysimeters sampled relatively immobile soil matrix solution during unsaturated conditions. The effect of land use on DOC and DON concentrations was largely limited to the most shallow (20 cm) sampling depth where DOC concentrations were greater in the forest (only zero tension lysimeters) and DON concentrations were greater in the cropland (both lysimeter types). In contrast to DOC and DON concentrations, the effect of land use on DOM properties persisted to the deepest sampling depth (60 cm), suggesting that DOM in the cropland was more decomposed regardless of lysimeter type. DOC concentrations and DOM properties differed between lysimeter types only in the forest at 20 cm where soil solutions collected with zero tension lysimeters had greater DOC concentrations, greater SUVA(254), greater humification index and lower HPI-C. Our data highlight the importance of considering DOM quality in addition to DOC quantity, and indicate long-term cultivation reduced the delivery of relatively less decomposed DOM to all soil depths.

J	Hur, J; Shin, J; Kang, M; Cho, J				Hur, Jin; Shin, Jaewon; Kang, Minsun; Cho, Jinwoo			Tracking variations in fluorescent-dissolved organic matter in an aerobic submerged membrane bioreactor using excitation-emission matrix spectra combined with parallel factor analysis	BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												In this study, the variations in the fluorescent components of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were tracked for an aerobic submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) at three different operation stages (cake layer formation, condensation, and after cleaning). The fluorescent DOM was characterized using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Non-aromatic carbon structures appear to be actively involved in the membrane fouling for the cake layer formation stage as revealed by much higher UV-absorbing DOM per organic carbon found in the effluent versus those inside the reactor. Four fluorescent components were successfully identified from the reactor and the effluent DOMs by EEM-PARAFAC modeling. Among those in the reactor, microbial humic-like fluorescence was the most abundant component at the cake layer formation stage and tryptophan-like fluorescence at the condensation stage. In contrast to the reactor, relatively similar composition of the PARAFAC components was exhibited for the effluent at all three stages. Tryptophan-like fluorescence displayed the largest difference between the reactor and the effluent, suggesting that this component could be a good tracer for membrane fouling. It appears that the fluorescent DOM was involved in membrane fouling by cake layer formation rather than by internal pore adsorption because its difference between the reactor and the effluent was the highest among all the four components, even after the membrane cleaning. Our study provided an insight into the fate and the behavior fluorescent DOM components for an MBR system, which could be an indicator of the membrane fouling.																	1615-7591	1615-7605				AUG	2014	37	8					1487	1496		10.1007/s00449-013-1120-2						WOS:000339962400002	24390578

To probe the influences of DOM characteristics on trihalomethanes (THMs) formation reactivity during chlorination, THMs yield and speciation of DOM fractions was investigated. It was found that chlorine reactivity of DOM decreased with the decrease of molecular weight (MW), and MW > 30 kDa fractions produced over 55% of total THMs in chlorinated MBR effluent. Hydrophobic organics had much higher THMs formation reactivity than hydrophilic substances. Particularly, hydrophobic acids exhibited the highest chlorine reactivity and contributed up to 71% of total THMs formation. Meanwhile, low-MW and hydrophilic DOM were susceptible to produce bromine-containing THMs. Of the fluorescent DOM in MBR effluent, aromatic moieties and humic acid-like had higher chlorine reactivity. Conclusively, macromolecular and hydrophobic organics containing aromatic moieties and humic acid-like must be removed to reduce THMs formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Conservative behavior along the salinity gradient of DOC and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has often been observed in estuaries from their freshwater end-member (salinity = 0) to the ocean (salinity = 35). While the oligo/meso-haline (salinity <10) tidal zone of upper estuaries has been suggested to be more complex and locally influenced by geomorphological and hydrological features, the environmental dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the environmental drivers controlling its source, transport, and fate have scarcely been evaluated. Here, we investigated the distribution patterns of DOC and CDOM optical properties determined by UV absorbance at 254 nm (A(254)) and excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) along the lower salinity range (salinity < 10) of the oligo/meso-haline zone for three distinct wetland-influenced rivers; namely the Bekanbeushi River, a cool-temperate river with estuarine lake in Hokkaido, Japan, the Harney River, a subtropical river with tidally-submerged mangrove fringe in Florida, USA, and the Judan River, a small, acidic, tropical rainforest river in Borneo, Malaysia. For the first two rivers, a clear decoupling between DOC and A(254) was observed, while these parameters showed similar conservative behavior for the third. Three distinct EEM-PARAFAC models established for each of the rivers provided similar spectroscopic characteristics except for some unique fluorescence features observed for the Judan River. The distribution patterns of PARAFAC components suggested that the inputs from plankton and/or submerged aquatic vegetation can be important in the Bekanbeushi River. Further, DOM photo-products formed in the estuarine lake were also found to be transported upstream. In the Harney River, whereas upriver-derived terrestrial humic-like components were mostly distributed conservatively, some of these components were also derived from mangrove inputs in the oligo/meso-haline zone. Interestingly, fluorescence intensities of some terrestrial humic-like components increased with salinity for the Judan River possibly due to changes in the dissociation state of acidic functional groups and/or increase in the fluorescence quantum yield along the salinity gradient The protein-like and microbial humic-like components were distributed differently between three wetland rivers, implying that interplay between loss to microbial degradation and inputs from diverse sources are different for the three wetland-influenced rivers. The results presented here indicate that upper estuarine oligo/meso-haline regions of coastal wetland rivers are highly dynamic with regard to the biogeochemical behavior of DOM.

J	Singh, S; Dutta, S; Inamdar, S				Singh, Shatrughan; Dutta, Sudarshan; Inamdar, Shreeram			Land application of poultry manure and its influence on spectrofluorometric characteristics of dissolved organic matter	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Land application of manure is a common practice that is used to supplement nutrients from fertilizers as well as to reuse and recycle waste in agricultural watersheds. Excess application of manure can however result in elevated exports of organic and inorganic nutrients in runoff. We evaluated the concentration and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in runoff from cropland (corn) receiving poultry manure. Manure was applied once every three years at the rate of 9 Mg ha(-1) in early spring and was incorporated into the soil during application. Surface runoff and soil water sampling was performed for eight natural storm events with one storm event prior to manure application. Samples were collected from the field edge, upland and lowland riparian zones and a receiving stream. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were highest at the field edge (mean: 94 mg L-1) and then declined sharply for the riparian and stream locations. Temporally, DOC concentrations in field runoff were highest for the first storm event following manure application and then declined quickly over the next 1-3 weeks. DOM composition in runoff following manure application had low aromaticity and a microbial/tryptophan-like character. These characteristics evolved with time toward more aromatic, more humic, and a terrestrial-like DOM composition. The decrease in runoff DOM was attributed to sorption and microbial degradation. Our observations suggest that while concentrations of DOM can be low in manure runoff, a short period (1-3 weeks) following manure application could be an environmentally sensitive and vulnerable period for runoff water quality.

In order to investigate the effects of SRT on trihalomethane (THM) formation in chlorinated PAC/MBR effluents, characteristics and THM formation reactivity of effluent dissolved organic matter (EfOM) at different SRTs were examined. PAC/MBR-180 had higher level of EfOM, which contained less simple aromatic proteins and exhibited lower specific UV absorbance. EfOM with molecular weight <5 kDa from PAC/MBR-30 (23%) was lower than PAC/MBR-180 (26%). About 50% of EfOM from PAC/MBR-30 was hydrophobic acids, which was higher than that from PAC/MBR-180 (about 36%). EfOM at SRT 180 days exhibited higher hydrophilicity. Prolonging SRT greatly reduced THM formation reactivity of EfOM, but increased the formation of bromine-containing species during chlorination of PAC/MBR effluents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration, however, is lower in paddy soils. We hypothesize that soil moisture strongly controls the fate of DOM, and thereby leads to differences between the two agricultural soils under contrasting management regimens. A 100-day incubation experiment was conducted to trace the fate and biodegradability of DOM in paddy and upland soils under three moisture levels: 45%, 75%, and 105% of the water holding capacity (WHC). C-14 labeled DOM, extracted from the C-14 labeled rice plant material, was incubated in paddy and upland soils, and the mineralization to (CO2)-C-14 and incorporation into microbial biomass were analyzed. Labile and refractory components of the initial C-14 labeled DOM and their respective half-lives were calculated by a double exponential model. During incubation, the mineralization of the initial C-14 labeled DOM in the paddy soils was more affected by moisture than in the upland soils. The amount of C-14 incorporated into the microbial biomass (2.4-11.0% of the initial DOM-C-14 activity) was less affected by moisture in the paddy soils than in the upland soils. At any of the moisture levels, 1) the mineralization of DOM to (CO2)-C-14 within 100 days was 1.2-2.1-fold higher in the paddy soils (41.9-60.0% of the initial DOM-C-14 activity) than in the upland soils (28.7-35.7%), 2) C-14 activity remaining in solution was significantly lower in the paddy soils than in the upland soils, and 3) C-14 activity remaining in the same agricultural soil solution was not significantly different among the three moisture levels after 20 days. Therefore, moisture strongly controls DOM fate, but moisture was not the key factor in determining the lower DOM in the paddy soils than in the upland soils. The UV absorbance of DOM at 280 nm indicates less aromaticity of DOM from the paddy soils than from the upland soils. At any of the moisture levels, much more labile DOM was found in paddy soils (343-49.2% of the initial C-14 labeled DOM) compared with that in upland soils (19.4-23.9%). This demonstrates that the lower DOM content in the paddy soil compared with that in the upland soil is probably determined by the less complex components and structure of the DOM.

Effects of charging on the chromophores of dissolved organic matter from the Rio Negro basin	WATER RESEARCH												This study demonstrates that the deprotonation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from a small creek characteristic for DOM-rich waters located in the Rio Negro basin can be quantified based on measurements of pH effects on its absorbance spectra. The method was ascertained by the data of Near-Edge X-Ray Absorbance Spectroscopy (NEX-AFS), potentiometric titration to quantify the structural and compositional differences between the colloidal and hydrophobic fractions that contribute 91% of black-water creek DOM. Changes in the absorbance spectra of the DOM fractions caused by deprotonation quantified via numeric deconvolution which indicated the presence of six well-resolved Gaussian bands in the differential spectra. The emergence of these bands was determined to be associated with the engagement of carboxylic and phenolic functionalities and changes of inter-chromophore interactions in DOM molecules. Interpretation of the data based on the NICA-Donnan approach showed that behavior of DOM chromophores was consistent with results of potentiometric titrations. Similar trends were observed for changes of the spectral slope of the DOM absorbance spectra in the range of wavelengths 325-375 nm (DSlope(325-375)). The behavior of DSlope(325-375) values was modeled based on the NICA-Donnan approach and correlated with potentiometrically-estimated charges attributed to the carboxylic and phenolic groups. The correlations between DSlope(325-375) and charges of low- and high-affinity protonation-active groups in DOM were monotonic but not linear and had important differences between the colloidal and hydrophobic fractions.

J	Pengerud, A; Johnsen, LK; Mulder, J; Strand, LT				Pengerud, Annelene; Johnsen, Line Kristin; Mulder, Jan; Strand, Line Tau			Potential adsorption of dissolved organic matter in poorly podzolised, high-latitude soils	GEODERMA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an essential role in many biogeochemical processes in soil and water, and the retention of DOM in soils influences the amount and composition of DOM exported from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Adsorption in soil mineral horizons is considered a main mechanism by which DOM is retained and stabilised in soils, and podzol soils have received attention due to their capacity to retain DOM in the mineral B horizon. With the projected increase in temperature and precipitation at higher latitudes, the transport of organic matter is expected to increase, but few studies have investigated the adsorption of DOM in poorly podzolised soils at higher latitudes. In this study, we used batch equilibrium experiments to investigate the potential for DOM adsorption in the B horizon of poorly podzolised soils from a confined area in Neiden, northern Norway. We used the Initial Mass (IM) isotherm to describe the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removed from or released to solution by the soil as a linear function of the amount of DOC added to the soil-water suspension. Our results suggest that the affinity for DOC of B horizons in poorly podzolised high-latitude soils is largely determined by the content of amorphous Fe and Al oxides, where adsorption is limited by the saturation of amorphous Fe and Al with organic matter. The B horizons show a relatively large variation in DOC sorption characteristics, with an overall low potential to adsorb added DOC at field relevant DOC concentrations. Six out of twelve B horizons show a net DOC desorption over the whole range of added DOC (0-480 mg C kg(-1) soil). These findings indicate a limited potential for retention and stabilisation of DOM in poorly podzolised soils at higher latitudes in a warmer and wetter climate. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of these supposedly ubiquitous molecules was concluded to represent the refractory marine DOM pool. This study demonstrates that 24 h of exposure of Atlantic and Pacific surface DOM to simulated sunlight causes phototransformation of about half of these supposedly refractory molecular compositions. It is suggested that these transformations are related to indirect photobleaching possibly involving reactive oxygen species (e.g. hydroxyl radicals), because very little change in the fluorescent component of the DOM (FDOM) was observed during the photo-degradation experiments. A significant decline in average mass with distinct decrease of average O/C ratios and concomitant increase of H/C ratios was observed. NMR spectra revealed a decrease in aromatic and olefinic unsaturation and the formation of a limited and near identical suite of oxygenated aliphatic compounds in both Atlantic and Pacific surface DOM. Their NMR characteristics indicated a mixture of about 10 polyols that are plausible products of convergent pathways of photochemical carbohydrate decomposition and oxidation of functionalized, branched aliphatic compounds. These prominent photochemical signature molecules amounted to -2% of total proton NMR integral and are expected to be quickly consumed by various microorganisms in the open ocean. These results may suggest a fast photo-induced large-scale cycling of DOM within the surface ocean dynamic equilibrium of photo- and bio-transformations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we examine the distributions of humic-like fluorescent DOM, factions of recalcitrant DOM, and the level of apparent oxygen utilization in the Japan Sea. We find linear relationships between these parameters for the deep water (>200 m) of the Japan Sea, suggesting that fluorescent DOM is produced in situ in the Japan Sea. Furthermore, we find that the amount of fluorescent DOM at a given apparent oxygen utilization is greater in the deep water of the Japan Sea than it is in the North Pacific, where the highest level of fluorescent DOM in the open ocean was previously observed. We conclude that the repeated renewal of the deep water contributes to the accumulation of fluorescent DOM in the interior of the Japan Sea.

Sampling was conducted for two separate sampling periods of a non-storm event in May and a storm event in August, 2012. The dam reservoir had experienced long-term enrichment of non-biodegradable organic matter since its construction in February, 2010. In May, significant differences were observed in several selected CDOM properties between the upstream catchments and the locations affected by the impoundment (i.e., within the reservoir and the downstream sites). For the storm event, however, such impoundment effects became much less pronounced likely due to elevated input of CDOM with terrestrial origin into the reservoir. Specific THM formation potential (STHMFP) did not show the same spatial distinction as those of CDOM for both sampling periods. Three fluorophore groups were identified from fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) of the collected samples by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling. Protein-like and microbial humic-like components were relatively more enriched for the impoundment-affected sites compared to the upstream locations, in which terrestrial humic-like component was more dominant. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the accumulation of non-biodegradable organic matter in the dam reservoir might be attributed to microbial humification of the algal-derived organic substances originated from either periphytons flushed from upstream stream beds or decomposing algae settled on the bottom of the reservoir, or both.

Dissolved Organic Matter Quality and Bioavailability Changes Across an Urbanization Gradient in Headwater Streams	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Landscape urbanization broadly alters watersheds and stream ecosystems, yet the impact of nonpoint source urban inputs on the quantity, quality, and ultimate fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is poorly understood. We assessed DOM quality and microbial bioavailability in eight first-order Coastal Plain headwater streams along a gradient of urbanization (i.e., percent watershed impervious cover); none of the streams had point source discharges. DOM quality was measured using fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Bioavallability was assessed using biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations. Results showed that watershed impervious cover was significantly related to stream DOM composition: increasing impervious cover was associated with decreased amounts of natural humic-like DOM and enriched amounts of anthropogenic fulvic acid-like and protein-like DOM. Microbial bioavailability of DOM was greater in urbanized streams during spring and summer, and was related to decreasing proportions of humic-like DOM and increasing proportions of protein-like DOM. Increased bioavallability was associated with elevated extracellular enzyme activity of the initial microbial community supplied to samples during BDOC incubations. These findings indicate that changes in stream DOM quality due to watershed urbanization may impact stream ecosystem metabolism and ultimately the fate of organic carbon transported through fluvial systems.

Origin, composition, and transformation of dissolved organic matter in tropical peatlands	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Solid and dissolved organic matter (DOM) compositions were investigated in a pristine and a deforested tropical peat forest in Brunei Darussalam. A combination of elemental (%C, %N, C/N), isotopic (delta(15) N, delta C-13, Delta C-14), molecular (lignin phenol biomarkers) and optical (Specific UV Absorbance at 280 nm (SUVA(280)), fluorescence index (FI)) analyses were performed to characterize DOM in porewater and river water. The DOM composition was compared to vegetation and peat to assess DOM origin and transformations in the ecosystem. Significant relationships were observed between optical properties (SUVA(280), FI) and bulk (Delta C-14) and molecular (ratio of cinnamyl to vanillyl phenols, C/V) composition of DOM. The radiocarbon content of DOM shows that it is modern at both sites for both surface and deep (to 4.5 m) samples (Delta C-14 = 74.58 +/- 8.53 parts per thousand at the pristine site and Delta C-14 = 87.84 +/- 4.5 parts per thousand at the deforested site for the first 2 meters), indicating transport of young DOM to deeper layers. Stable carbon-13 content of vegetation, peat and DOM showed only slight fractionation and ranged from -32.2 parts per thousand to -28.3 parts per thousand. Nitrogen showed a greater shift between ecosystem pools. Nitrogen-15 content was higher in the solid peat (delta N-15 = -0.92 +/- 0.49 parts per thousand in the pristine site, delta N-15 = -1.22 +/- 1.37 parts per thousand in the deforested site) than in DOM (delta N-15 = -4.2 +/- 2.5 parts per thousand in the pristine site, delta N-15 = -4.1 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand in the deforested site). This difference in delta N-15 is significantly correlated with the C/N values of peat and DOM and attributable to higher microbial degradation in the peat compared to DOM. Porewater DOM contains less lignin (lambda 8 = 1.10 +/- 0.27 mg 100 mg dw(-1) in the pristine site and lambda 8 = 1.38 +/- 0.46 mg 100 mg dw(-1) in the deforested site) than does the solid peat (lambda 8 = 5.66 +/- 2.14 mg 100 mg dw(-1) in the pristine site and lambda 8 = 10.29 +/- 4.69 mg 100 mg dw(-1) in the deforested site). All indicators of lignin degradation (P/(V + S), 3,5Bd/V, (Ad/Al) V, (Ad/Al)S) are significantly higher in DOM than in the solid peat. This shows that lignin can be processed rapidly in the porewater of upper layers of tropical peatlands. Logging activity affected the composition of organic matter at the deforested site. Higher lignin content (lambda 8) was observed in the solid peat, and the composition of DOM differed greatly in the deforested site: Delta C-14, FI, 3,5Bd/V, (Ad/Al)V are significantly different from the pristine site. Thus it appears that the composition of DOM is more sensitive than the solid phase to the effects of land use change on organic matter dynamic in tropical peatlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamics of dissolved organic matter: A view from two dimensional correlation spectroscopy techniques	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the most reactive organic carbon pool in earth. However, the heterogeneity of this organic mixture makes it difficult to investigate its dynamics under different external perturbations. In this review, we present the potential of using the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis (2D correlations) as a tool to study the dynamic of DOM. We demonstrate the application of the 2D correlation analysis on high molecular weight DOM (HMW-DOM) with the salinity as perturbation parameter. We used four different chemical probes: Carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13 NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS).

Here we report a survey of soil solution dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in agricultural soils with contrasting properties. Eighty-seven agricultural topsoils were sampled throughout Europe. Soil solution was isolated by centrifugation (3500 g) from soils sampled field moist and analyzed directly (n = 30), from air-dried soils that were rewetted and incubated for 5 wk (n = 30), or from soils stored moist at 4 degrees C during 1.5 yr (n = 39). The soil storage and treatment effects on DOC concentrations in membrane filtered soil solution (0.45 mm), tested on identical samples, showed that air-drying followed by wetting increased DOC 2.5- to 7.8-fold compared with freshly sampled field moist samples, whereas cold storage had inconsistent effects. In the entire data set, DOC in the soil solution ranged from 12 to 104 mg C L-1 (10th-90th percentile), with a median of 33 mg C L-1. Soil or soil solution properties (including ionic strength) only explained 14% of the variance of log[DOC] in freshly sampled soils, whereas 41% was explained in the entire dataset. The stepwise regression models predict that DOC increases with increasing soil organic matter content and decreasing pH or % base saturation. The specific UV-absorbance of DOM at 254 nm (SUVA) as an indicator of the aromaticity of DOM ranged sevenfold among samples. Soil drying and rewetting decreased the SUVA of DOM, suggesting that DOM released after rewetting originates from decaying biomass rather than from humified organic matter. The DOC concentrations are largely affected by drying-rewetting processes. In freshly sampled soils, DOC concentrations correlate poorly to physicochemical properties of the soil, likely due to biological processes involved.																	1539-1663					JUL	2014	13	7								10.2136/vzj2013.09.0167						WOS:000343161800001

Dissolved Organic Matter: Linking Soils and Aquatic Systems	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a crucial role in many important processes that take place in terrestrial and aquatic systems. These include carbon and nutrient cycling, pedogenesis, and microbial metabolism. Here we highlight the results of studies that demonstrate the role of DOM in linking terrestrial and aquatic systems. We emphasize three fundamental aspects of the research, which together show the importance of DOM in linking terrestrial and aquatic systems: First, tracing DOM properties during its transport through terrestrial and aquatic systems is a powerful tool for improving our conceptual understanding of the mechanistic drivers of DOM dynamics. Second, linking DOM dynamics to important physical processes such as hydrology provides important insights into the nature of terrestrial-aquatic links. Third, interrelations between DOM dynamics and human impacts on ecosystems highlight how the role of DOM in coupled terrestrial-aquatic systems may change in the future. New measurement and modeling approaches have enabled a more thorough assessment of all three aspects of DOM dynamics. They show that both natural and anthropogenic drivers not only greatly influence DOM dynamics in soils, but owing to the mobility of DOM, also have substantial influence on aquatic systems. This physical connection of soils and surface waters demonstrates the importance of understanding fundamental processes such as nutrient cycling, pedogenesis, and microbial metabolism at a whole-landscape scale.

Constraints on the Sources and Production Mechanisms of Dissolved Organic Matter in Soils from Molecular Biomarkers	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Spatio-temporal modifications of the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a wetland in an agricultural catchment were investigated using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation with tetramethylammonium hydroxide coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (THM-GC-MS). The results were compared with previous data acquired on the same samples using ultraviolet spectroscopy and the stable C isotope ratio. The correlation between molecular markers and bulk-scale descriptors validated the use of THM-GC-MS to investigate the fate of DOM in soils. Molecular proxies, including lignin markers, tannin markers, carbohydrates, and fatty acids, were classified into plant-derived and microbial markers. At the beginning of the hydrologic year, associated with the recharge period, the DOM composition was similar along the depth profile and >70% of the analyzed markers were from plant-derived origins. The rise in the water table was associated with a shift from vertical to horizontal water flow due to water saturation and resulted in a clear vertical heterogeneity, i.e., a varying composition throughout the profile. In the surface horizons, the proportion of plant-derived markers remained >70%, while in the deep horizon this proportion was <30%. Last, the lowering of the water table resulted in the homogenization of the DOM composition along the depth profile.

We examined effects of doubling locally collected throughfall for 6 yr on the concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC) and properties of DOM (aromaticity, degree of molecule complexity) in the forest floor. Forest floor solutions below the Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons were sampled every 2 to 4 wk using tension lysimeters. For the controls, the average DOC concentrations in 2002 to 2007 were 43.8 +/- 2.6 mg L-1 below the Oi, 49.6 +/- 2.7 mg L-1 below the Oe, and 61.0 +/- 2.0 mg L-1 below the Oa horizon. Doubling throughfall resulted in average DOC concentrations of 37.4 +/- 1.8 mg L-1 (Oi), 49.3 +/- 1.6 mg L-1 (Oe), and 50.1 +/- 8.0 mg L-1 (Oa). The decreases in concentrations due to throughfall addition as well as the effects on DOM properties were, however, not statistically significant. It is commonly assumed that throughfall inputs are linearly related to water fluxes within and from the forest floor. Under that assumption, the results suggest that DOM fluxes are controlled by water fluxes rather than by the quantity of C that can be mobilized from the soil organic matter. Hence, increasing precipitation due to future climate changes presumably will result in enhanced DOM fluxes into the mineral horizons.

Therefore, determining the interactions of HMs with soils and dissolved organic matter (DOM) is essential to predict their fate. To find out the effect of DOM and soil properties (clay minerals, oxides, and bulk organic matter [OM]) on the uptake of Cu, Ni, and Zn, batch adsorption experiments were conducted using five soils sampled from Egypt. The sorption isotherms were well described by the initial mass (IM) isotherm model. The amount and timing of DOM addition was found to play a pivotal role in determining the affinity of the HMs for soil. When DOM and HMs were added simultaneously, the affinity of Cu decreased in Fe-(hydr) oxide-rich soils (by 7%) and increased in soils poor in Fe-(hydr) oxide (by 6-10%). When DOM was added first, followed by HMs, the affinity of Cu strongly increased. In contrast, affinity of both Ni and Zn was enhanced (3-18%) in the presence of DOM, regardless of the timing of DOM addition. The difference is explained by Cu binding to the solid phase and DOM through strong inner-sphere complexes, whereas Ni and Zn adsorbed predominantly through weaker electrostatic interactions. As a result, Cu was able to bind more strongly to previously adsorbed DOM on the solid phase in the case of smectite, while this effect was counteracted by the coating of available specific binding sites on Fe-(hydr) oxides. The study has revealed that Egyptian soils hold great potential to remove HMs from aqueous solutions.

J	Roth, VN; Dittmar, T; Gaupp, R; Gleixner, G				Roth, Vanessa-Nina; Dittmar, Thorsten; Gaupp, Reinhard; Gleixner, Gerd			Ecosystem-Specific Composition of Dissolved Organic Matter	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												We investigated the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from various rivers, bogs and soil sites to test for their ecosystems unique molecular patterns. This information is prerequisite for searching of new marker compounds that might help tracing the fate of ecosystem-derived organic matter from terrestrial to marine systems. We used electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) to identify the ecosystem-specific molecular DOM characteristics. We investigated 39 samples and explored their patterns through nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Based on the intrasystem similarity, we identified unique molecular formulae for each ecosystem and compared their main characteristics. Our data indicate a pH influence on all samples and possibly a vegetation influence on soil water samples. We interpreted the lack of nitrogen-containing compounds in the surface water and the lower molecular size in the soil water with higher microbial activity and reworking in soils and the lack of aromatic compounds in surface waters as the result of photo degradation. Our results demonstrate that this approach is suitable for resolving ecosystem-specific markers; the tannin molecular formulae seemed to be particularly suited markers for forest systems. However, we emphasize that it is necessary to collect a larger number of samples and reasonable environmental parameters to explain the distinctive molecular features and evaluate new markers. Aside from the ecosystem-specific features, we also found a suite of compounds that were present in all samples, indicating the convergent evolution of terrestrial DOM for a wide gradient of physicochemical and biological features. The molecular formulae of these ubiquitous compounds match those of carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), but distinction from lignin is only possible by applying methods that elucidated the molecular structure.

Prior studies have shown that pristine Al-and Fe-(oxy) hydroxide surfaces are especially reactive toward DOM sorptive stabilization. However, the impact of progressive and/or preexisting organic surface coatings on further surficial uptake and exchange during repeated DOM infusion episodes remains unclear. In this study, DOM solutions were extracted from organic horizons in grassland (G) and mixed conifer forest (F) vegetation types in the Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory. Extracted DOM solutions were used to sequentially irrigate columns packed with either quartz sand (Qtz), Al-hydroxide-coated quartz sand (Al-Qtz), or Fe-hydroxide-coated quartz sand (Fe-Qtz). Use of distinct DOM sources enabled investigation of how sorption, fractionation, and exchange ensued during reactive transport through mineral media progressively coated with sorbate organic matter (SOM). During initial irrigation of fresh mineral media with G-DOM, the magnitude of DOM sorption (per unit sorbent mass) followed the trend: Al-Qtz >= Fe-Qtz > Qtz. Effluent solutions showed diminished molar absorptivity and humification index (HIX) values, indicating preferential uptake of high-molar-mass aromatic constituents. Introduction of F-DOM to G-SOM-coated surfaces revealed competitive desorption of G-SOM from the organo-mineral interface. During F-DOM irrigation, high HIX values were observed in effluent solutions, indicating remobilization of G-SOM by displacement. According to spectroscopic analyses, the displaced G-SOM consisted of aromatic phenolic acids with high excitation-emission "fingerprints" characteristic of fulvic-and humic-acid-like compounds, providing evidence for kinetic DOM exchange reactions.																	1539-1663					JUL	2014	13	7								10.2136/vzj2013.10.0179						WOS:000343161800008

A medium resolution imaging spectrometer, chromophoric dissolved organic matter product was evaluated with in situ absorption coefficient (R-2 = 0.9605, RMS = 0.1672 and MRE = 0.3930). L2 daily products were then averaged into monthly data to analyze variability in the specified area from January 2003 to December 2009. Accumulated anomaly analysis and the wavelet analysis showed that the variability had a significant period of one year from 2003 to 2009, accompanied with 3 and 6 month periods in 2004 and 2008 separately. Cross wavelet transform was used to analyze the relationships between chromophoric dissolved organic matter and its influence factors including rainfall and phytoplankton in time frequency space. Relationships with salinity and light were also analyzed. It was found that photobleaching induces lower dissolved organic matter in summer even though there is greater discharge due to large rainfall intensity during this season. However, the anomalous strong precipitation may cause significantly higher findings in the study area. An example was a heavy flood caused by strong precipitation in 2008 induced higher findings for the period for less than half a year.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JUL-SEP	2014	17	3			SI		261	270		10.1080/14634988.2014.944479						WOS:000342280800008

Time-course experiments were carried out to quantify primary production, phytoplankton excretion, and the microbial uptake of freshly released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from phytoplankton extracellular release (DOCp) in four large tropical lakes distributed along a productivity gradient: Kivu, Edward, Albert, and Victoria. The contributions of the major heterotrophic bacterial groups to the uptake of DOCp was also analyzed in Lake Kivu, using microautoradiography coupled to catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescent in situ hybridization. The percentage of extracellular release (PER) varied across the productivity gradient, with higher values at low productivity. Furthermore, PER was significantly related to high light and low phosphate concentrations in the mixed layer and was comparatively higher in oligotrophic tropical lakes than in their temperate counterparts. Both observations suggest that environmental factors play a key role in the control of phytoplankton excretion. Standing stocks of DOCp were small and generally contributed less than 1% to the total DOC because it was rapidly assimilated by prokaryotes. In other words, there was a tight coupling between the production and the heterotrophic consumption of DOCp. None of the major phylogenetic bacterial groups that were investigated differed in their ability to take up DOCp, in contrast with earlier results reported for standard labeled single-molecule substrates (leucine, glucose, adenosine triphosphate). It supports the idea that the metabolic ability to use DOCp is widespread among heterotrophic prokaryotes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of carbon transfer between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in large African lakes.

These measurements identified highly significant empirical relationships between CDOM concentration measured using the in situ fluorescence sensor and CDOM absorption, fluorescence, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. CDOM concentration expressed in quinine sulfate equivalent units, was highly correlated with the CDOM absorption coefficient (r(2) = 0.80, p < 0.001), fluorescence intensities (Ex./Em. 370/460 nm) (r(2) = 0.91, p < 0.001), the fluorescence index (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001) and the humification index (r(2) = 0.78, p < 0.001), suggesting that CDOM concentration measured using the in situ fluorescence sensor could act as a substitute for the CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence measured in the laboratory. Similarly, CDOM concentration was highly correlated with DOC concentration (r(2) = 0.68, p < 0.001), indicating that in situ CDOM fluorescence sensor measurements could be a proxy for DOC concentration. In addition, significant positive correlations were found between laboratory CDOM absorption coefficients and COD (r(2) = 0.83, p < 0.001), TP (r(2) = 0.82, p < 0.001) concentrations, suggesting a potential further application for the real-time monitoring of water quality using an in situ CDOM fluorescence sensor.

Colored Dissolved Organic Matter Dynamics in the Northern Gulf of Mexico from Ocean Color and Numerical Model Results	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption and salinity relationships were assessed and used in conjunction with the salinity and current outputs of a numerical model (Navy Coastal Ocean Model [NCOM] to study CDOM dynamics in the northern Gulf of Mexico. In situ CDOM absorption and salinity obtained from multiple field campaigns were inversely correlated seasonally (winter spring and summer) and latitudinally (inner- and outer-shelf zones), suggesting conservative behavior of CDOM distribution. A weaker correlation, during summer in the outer-shelf zone, however, indicated stronger effects of photooxidation and lower masking effects from riverine CDOM. Applying these relationships to simulated salinity resulted in hourly maps of CDOM that revealed similarities to CDOM patterns derived from SeaWiFS satellite imagery. Further, matchup comparisons between model-derived and in situ CDOM absorption were statistically sound for the summer (bias=-0.016, root mean square error=0.059, r(2)=0.51 SI=0.28) and the winter spring periods (bias = 0.033, root mean square error = 0.099, r(2) = 0.52, SI = 0.21). Overlaying the model-derived CDOM maps on the simulated currents revealed the strong influence of currents on CDOM advection. Downcoast currents during the nonsummer months led to persistent advection of CDOM westward interrupted by frequent cold front events that flush CDOM-laden waters out of the coastal bays onto the inner and outer continental shelves. In contrast, the upcoast current regime, though less well organized, produces a more significant seaward advection of CDOM, likely due to the Ekman transport and subsequent entrainment by mesoscale eddies over the continental slope.

We tested the hypothesis that microorganisms introduced to the pools during floods faced environmental filtering toward a 'typical' karst water community, and we investigated whether DOM composition was related to floodings and the residence time of water in stagnant pools. As predicted, longer water residence consistently led to a decline of bacterial diversity. The microbial assemblages in the influx water harbored more 'exotic' lineages with large distances to known genotypes, yet these initial communities already appeared to be shaped by selective processes. beta-Proteobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) closely related to microbes from subsurface or surface aquatic environments were mainly responsible for the clustering of samples according to water residence time in the pools. By contrast, several Cytophagaceae and Flavobacteriaceae OTUs were related to different floodings, which were also the main determinants of DOM composition. A subset of compounds distinguishable by molecular mass and O/C content were characteristic for individual floods. Moreover, there was a transformation of DOM in stagnant pools toward smaller and more aromatic compounds, potentially also reflecting microbial utilization.

Characterization of biocoals and dissolved organic matter phases obtained upon hydrothermal carbonization of brewer's spent grain	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY												The wet biomass brewer's spent grain was subjected to hydrothermal carbonization to produce biocoal. Mass balance considerations indicate for about two thirds of the organic carbon of the input biomass to be transferred into the biocoal. The van Krevelen plot refers to a high degree of defunctionalization with decarboxylation prevailing over dehydration. Calorific data revealed a significant energy densification of biocoals as compared to the input substrate. Sorption coefficients of organic analytes covering a wide range of hydrophobicities and polarities on biocoal were similar to those for dissolved humic acids. Data from GC/MS analysis indicated that phenols and benzenediols along with fatty acids released from bound lipids during the hydrothermal process constituted abundant products. Our findings demonstrate that the brewer's spent grain by-product is a good feedstock for hydrothermal carbonization to produce biocoal, the latter offering good prospects for energetic and soil-improving application fields.

However, the mechanism of MeHg photodegradation is still not completely understood. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is expected to play a critical role in MeHg photodegradation. By using several techniques, including N-2/O-2 purging and the addition of stable isotope ((MeHg)-Hg-201), scavengers, competing ligands, and a singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generator, the role played by MeHg-DOM complexation in MeHg photodegradation of Everglades surface water was investigated. DOM appeared to be involved in MeHg photodegradation via the formation MeHg-DOM complexes based on three findings: (1) MeHg was quickly photodegraded in solutions containing DOM extracts; (2) degradation of MeHg did not occur in deionized water; and (3) addition of competing complexation reagents (dithiothreitol-DTT) dramatically prohibited the photodegradation of MeHg in Everglades water. Further experiments indicated that free radicals/reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), O-1(2), triplet excited state of DOM ((DOM)-D-3*), and hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)), played a minor role in MeHg photodegradation in Everglades water, based on the results of scavenger addition, O-1(2) generator addition and N-2/O-2 purging. A pathway, involving direct photodegradation of MeHg-DOM complexes via intramolecular electron transfer, is proposed as the dominant mechanism for MeHg photodegradation in Everglades water.

Sunlight-Driven Photochemical Halogenation of Dissolved Organic Matter in Seawater: A Natural Abiotic Source of Organobromine and Organoiodine	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with photochemically generated reactive halogen species (RHS) may represent an important natural source of organohalogens within surface seawaters. However, investigation of such processes has been limited by difficulties in quantifying low dissolved organohalogen concentrations in the presence of background inorganic halides. In this work, sequential solid phase extraction (SPE) and silver-form cation exchange filtration were utilized to desalt and preconcentrate seawater DOM prior to nonspecific organohalogen analysis by ICP-MS. Using this approach, native organobromine and organoiodine contents were found to range from 3.2-6.4 X 10(-4) mol Br/mol C and 1.1-3.8 X 10(-4) mol I/mol C (or 19-160 nmol Br L-1 and 6-36 nmol I L-1) within a wide variety of natural seawater samples, compared with 0.6-1.2 X 10(-4) mol Br/mol C and 0.6-1.1 X 10(-5) mol I/mol C in, I terrestrial natural organic matter (NOM) isolates. Together with a chemical probe method specific for RHS, the SPE+ICP-MS approach was also employed to demonstrate formation of nanomolar levels of organobromine and organoiodine during simulated and natural solar irradiation of DOM in artificial and natural seawaters. In a typical experiment, the organobromine content of 2.1 X 10(-4) mol C L-1 (2.5 mg C L-1) of Suwannee River NOM in artificial seawater increased by 69% (from 5.9 X 10(-5) to 1.0 X 10(-4) mol Br/mol C) during exposure to 24 h of simulated sunlight. Increasing I- concentrations (up to 2.0 x 10(-7) mol L-1) promoted increases of up to 460% in organoiodine content (from 8.5 X 10(-6) to 4.8 X 10(-5) mol I/mol C) at the expense of organobromine formation under the same conditions. The results reported herein suggest that sunlight-driven reactions of RHS with DOM may play a significant role in marine bromine and iodine cycling.

Molecular Mapping of Sorbent Selectivities with Respect to Isolation of Arctic Dissolved Organic Matter as Measured by Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The objectives of this study were to identify molecular features characteristic to arctic DOM from the Kolyma River basin and to elucidate structural imprints induced by a choice of the sorption technique. To achieve this goal, DOM was isolated from the Kolyma River basin with a use of three nonionic sorbents: Amberlite XAD-8 resin, PPL- and C18 - SPE cartridges, and one anion exchanging resin-diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) -cellulose. The structural studies were conducted with a use of electrospray ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrometry and liquid state H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The DOM isolates obtained with a use of PPL and C18 cartridges were characterized with higher content of aliphatic compounds as compared to XAD-8 and DEAE-isolates. In total, for all arctic DOM isolates we observed predominance of hydrogen saturated compounds with high H/C values of identified formulas from FT-ICR MS data. H-1 NMR spectroscopy studies have confirmed this trend and revealed high contribution of alkyl-chain protons into the spectral density of the arctic DOM reaching 43% for PPL isolates.

J	Zhang, QC; Hou, CP; Liang, YY; Feng, Y				Zhang, Qichun; Hou, Changping; Liang, Yingying; Feng, Ying			Dissolved organic matter release and retention in ultisols in relation to land use patterns	CHEMOSPHERE												The application of organic fertilizer to maintain soil fertility and crop yield has been practiced for thousands of years in China. This practice improves soil carbon sequestration, due to the high level of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in organic manure. In this study, batch equilibrium studies were conducted to examine the capacity of three ultisols from areas under different land use patterns to retain dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) extracted from rape cake and chicken manure. The results showed that the amount of DOM removed or released in solution by the soil was a linear function of the initial amount added to the soil-water system; therefore, analysis of sorption isotherms was best conducted using the initial mass isotherm IM method. The ultisol retained, on average, 19.9% of the total DOC and 41.7% of the total DON in solution, suggesting that ultisol has a relatively low DOC adsorption capacity. The ultisol from a bamboo forest was found to have a higher capacity than that from a pear orchard to retain DOC and DON. The adsorption affinities of DOM according to soil type were in the following order: bamboo forest (BF) > tea garden (TG) > pear orchard (PO). These results suggested that the continuous application of high doses of organic manure, particularly rape cake, may saturate the DOC adsorptive sites, thereby permitting increased leaching of DOC and the possibility of ground water contamination. Furthermore, we note that amorphous Fe and Al oxides play an important role in the adsorption capacity of both DOC and DON in ultisols. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Does a general relationship exist between fluorescent dissolved organic matter and microbial respiration?-The case of the dark equatorial Atlantic Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The distributions of humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter (at excitation/emission wavelengths of 340 nm/440 nm, F(340/440)) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) are determined from water samples taken at 27 stations along 7.5 degrees N, in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The relationship between F(340/440) and AOU is evaluated. The influence of water mass mixing is removed through multiple regressions of both F(340/440) and AOU with salinity and temperature for the ocean interior. A general and significant relationship between the residuals of F(340/440) and AOU is found for the entire water column deeper than 200 m (R-2=0.79, n=360, p-value < 0.001), endorsing the idea that changes in fluorescence intensity are directly related to in situ oxidation of organic matter by microbial activity in the dark equatorial Atlantic Ocean. In addition, we analyse and discuss the relationships between the residuals of F(340/440) and AOU for all individual water masses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of VAs on the soil microbial community function are not well understood. Particularly, few works have examined the combinational effects of VAs and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from animal wastes. In this study, DOM was extracted from pig manure and spiked into soils in combination with chlortetracycline (CTC) at three levels (0, 10, 100 mg kg(-1) soil). The control soil received only deionized water, and all treatments were incubated for 1, 6, 12 and 45 days. The microbial community function was characterized by investigating the community level physiological profiles (CLPP) using Biolog EcoPlates(TM) and the activities of several soil enzymes using the spectrophotometry method. The dynamic dissipation of CTC during the incubation period was determined using HPLC. The extractable concentration of CTC was shown to exponentially decrease, and the residual concentration after 45 days was <= 10.8% of the spiking concentration. DOM and CTC had contrary influences on the soil microbial community. The functional diversity indicated by the CLPP and soil enzyme activities were all clearly enhanced by DOM but tended to be inhibited by the co-application of CTC compared to DOM application alone. The significant effect of CTC was deduced to be primarily caused by DOM, which might facilitate bioavailability of CTC and stimulate the activity of microorganisms as additional carbon in the soil. Moreover, all of the microbial parameters were more affected by the incubation time than they were by the DOM and/or CTC treatments. The study demonstrated that the addition of CTC could have a measurable effect on the function of the soil microbial community in the presence of DOM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

During the course of the irradiations, 74-88 % of the original dissolved organic carbon was lost along with 95-99 % of the absorption at 300 nm. Based on changes observed during light exposure, three pools of DOM were identified: photo-labile, photo-refractory, and photo-produced compounds. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to determine structural moieties characteristic to each of these pools. These analyses showed aromatic carbons were preferentially removed while carbohydrate-like and amide/peptide-like carbons were preserved during UV exposure. An increase in carbon normalized C-13 NMR signal in the 0-50 ppm region suggests that alkyl moieties were produced, while FTIR signal at 1,745 cm(-1) and two-dimensional H-1-C-13 NMR results confirmed the photochemical production of acetate. Several properties typically used to trace terrigenous DOM in ocean margin and marine environments were significantly altered. Optical properties, including absorption spectral slopes and fluorescence indices, as well as carbon-normalized lignin yields shifted from terrestrial values towards those more typical of coastal or open ocean samples. The loss of terrestrial signatures during irradiation highlights the difficulty faced when quantifying the contribution of terrigenous DOM to aquatic carbon pools.

Bioavailability and radiocarbon age of fluvial dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a northern peatland-dominated catchment: effect of land-use change	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The radiocarbon age and biodegradability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a northern peat-dominated river system was studied and the effects of land-use were compared. Samples were obtained from streams and ditches comprising sub-catchments of the Kiiminki River, Northern Finland. Sample sites included areas of natural mire, areas subjected to moderate disturbance (ditching to enhance forestry), and areas subjected to serious land use change (agriculture and peat excavation). The study employed a 55 day bioassay that measured the biodegradation potential of surface-water DOM. We identified release of modern (mean 6-13 year old) DOM from natural sites, and material aged up to 1,553 years from disturbed sites. The proportion of biodegradable DOC ranged from 4.1 to 17.9 %, and bacterial DOC removal was modelled using twin-pool and reactivity-continuum (beta distribution) approaches. Bacterial growth efficiency ranged from 0.11 to 0.26 between areas of different land use, and these relatively low values reflect the humic-rich DOM released from boreal peatland. Despite the range of land-use types studied, including intensive peatland excavation areas, there was no detectable relationship between the biological lability of DOM and its radiocarbon age.

Processing of humic-rich riverine dissolved organic matter by estuarine bacteria: effects of predegradation and inorganic nutrients	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The bioavailability of predegraded dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a humic-rich, boreal river to estuarine bacteria from the Baltic Sea was studied in 39-day bioassays. The river waters had been exposed to various degrees of bacterial degradation by storing them between 0 and 465 days in dark prior to the bioassay. The resulting predegraded DOM was inoculated with estuarine bacteria and the subsequent changes in DOM quantity and quality measured. During the incubations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and oxygen concentrations decreased, indicating heterotrophic activity. Coloured DOM was degraded less than DOC, indicating a selective utilization of DOM, and humic-like fluorescence components increased during the incubations. The amount of DOC degraded was not affected by the length of DOM predegradation. The percentage of bioavailable DOC (%BDOC) was higher in experiment units with added inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus than without addition (on average 13.5 % and 9.0, respectively), but had no effect on the degradation of fresh, non-predegraded, DOC (%BDOC 12.0 %). Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highest (65 +/- A 2 %) in the units with fresh DOM, and lowest in units with predegraded DOM and no added inorganic nutrients (11 +/- A 4 %). The addition of inorganic nutrients increased the BGE of predegraded DOM units by an average of 28 +/- A 4 %. There was no significant effect on BGE by length of predegradation after the initial drop (< 3 months). This study suggests that both the length of predegradation and the inorganic nutrient status in the receiving estuary has consequences to carbon cycling and will determine the amount of terrestrial-derived DOC being ultimately assimilated into marine food webs.

Spectroscopic measurements of estuarine dissolved organic matter dynamics during a large-scale Mississippi River flood diversion	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Mississippi River Flood of 2011 prompted the opening of the Bonnet Cure Spillway (BCS) in southeastern Louisiana to protect the City of New Orleans. The BCS diverted approximately 21.9 km(3) of river water into the oligohaline Lake Pontchartrain Estuary over the course of 43 days. We characterized estuarine dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics before, during, and after the diversion in order to better understand the biogeochemical dynamics associated with these immense freshwater inflows. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exhibited a large degree of variability during and after the period of elevated primary productivity that occurred following the diversion. Furthermore, DOC analysis provides limited insight into carbon cycling during these dynamic periods. In order to overcome the limitations of DOC, spectroscopic methods were used to gain insights into chemical composition dynamics. Both ultraviolet visible (A(254), A(350), SUVA(254), spectral slope, and normalized UV/Vis) and fluorescence spectroscopy (excitation emission matrices and fluorescence and biological indices) were used to study the compositional changes of DOM over time. Collectively, our results document a perturbation in DOM chemistry in Lake Pontchartrain due to the diversion and a subsequent return toward pre-diversion conditions. Immediate increases in A(350) indicate that BCS freshwater contained elevated concentrations of lignin of terrestrial origin. Ensuing declines in A(350), along with changes in the fluorescence and biological indices, indicate that DOM rapidly became more microbial in composition. Our results provide insights into estuarine DOM dynamics relevant to systems receiving flood pulses of freshwater due to either hydrologic manipulation or precipitation events. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nageswara			Colored dissolved organic matter signature and phytoplankton response in a coastal ecosystem during mesoscale cyclonic (cold core) eddy	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and hydrochemical parameters were measured in the nearshore region of the western Bay of Bengal with and without significant terrestrial influence. A mesoscale cyclonic eddy that occupied the northern part of the study area set up a nutrient enriched distinct ecosystem in April (premonsoon) attended with increased levels of DOM fluorescence, particularly the protein tyrosine like fluorescence (B). A new (minor) fluorescence component, attributed to land source was revealed which contained two fluorophores, the red-shifted tryptophan-like (Tu) hypothesized as the "unfolded protein" and the petroleum hydrocarbon-like (P). During the eddy, pennate diatom population increased, bringing the centric:pennate diatom ratio to half of what it was during the remaining period (monsoon season). The nutrients distribution suggested that when pennates are favored (premonsoon), orthophosphate and silicate are the limiting nutrients and that when centric diatoms are favored (monsoon season), the limitation is by nitrate.

J	Kiikkila, O; Smolander, A; Ukonmaanaho, L				Kiikkila, Oili; Smolander, Aino; Ukonmaanaho, Liisa			Properties of Dissolved Organic Matter in Peatland: Implications for Water Quality after Harvest	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												We studied the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in drained boreal peatland in stem-only-harvested (SOH), whole-tree-harvested (WTH), and unharvested sites. The DOM derived from both aerobic and anaerobic peat layers was divided into four different molecular-weight fractions with ultrafiltration, and the fractions were measured for the concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOG), N, and carbohydrates, aromaticity (specific ultraviolet [UV] absorbance at 254 nm), pH, and bioavailability to bacteria. The percentage of DOG in the low-molecular-weight ([MW) fraction was higher in the deeper than in the upper layer. We suggest that easily degradable [MW compounds with low aromatic character and high bioavailability had not degraded in the deeper layer under anaerobic conditions. This had produced a relative enrichment of [MW DOC in the anaerobic layer. A different relation to aerobicity was observed in alternating aerobic conditions in the upper layer alone, where the high-molecular-weight compounds seemed to increase under more anaerobic conditions. Thus the properties and processes of DOM in peatlands seem to be controlled by the aerobicity in a complicated manner. We suggest that operations that affect the water table level in peatland affect also the properties of peat DOM. The properties of DOM that could be connected to clear-cut harvest-induced changes in the recent inputs of C and N were small. Peat DOM was more N rich in harvested than in control sites. Thus it seems possible that N is susceptible to leaching after harvest in naturally relatively N-rich sites and especially in mineral form.																	1539-1663					JUL	2014	13	7								10.2136/vzj2013.08.0155						WOS:000343161800013		
J	Rain-Franco, A; Munoz, C; Fernandez, C				Rain-Franco, Angel; Munoz, Claudia; Fernandez, Camila			Ammonium Production off Central Chile (36 degrees S) by Photodegradation of Phytoplankton-Derived and Marine Dissolved Organic Matter	PLOS ONE												We investigated the production of ammonium by the photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the coastal upwelling system off central Chile (36 degrees S). The mean penetration of solar radiation (Z1%) between April 2011 and February 2012 was 9.4 m, 4.4 m and 3.2 m for Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm), UV-A (320-400 nm) and UV-B (280-320 nm), respectively. Ammonium photoproduction experiments were carried out using exudates of DOM obtained from cultured diatom species (Chaetoceros muelleri and Thalassiosira minuscule) as well as natural marine DOM. Diatom exudates showed net photoproduction of ammonium under exposure to UVR with a mean rate of 0.56 +/- 0.4 mu mol L-1 h(-1) and a maximum rate of 1.49 mu mol L-1 h(-1). Results from natural marine DOM showed net photoproduction of ammonium under exposure to PAR+UVR ranging between 0.06 and 0.2 mu mol L-1 h(-1). We estimated the potential contribution of photochemical ammonium production for phytoplankton ammonium demand. Photoammonification of diatom exudates could support between 117 and 453% of spring-summer NH4+ assimilation, while rates obtained from natural samples could contribute to 50-178% of spring-summer phytoplankton NH4+ requirements. These results have implications for local N budgets, as photochemical ammonium production can occur year-round in the first meters of the euphotic zone that are impacted by full sunlight.																	1932-6203					JUN 26	2014	9	6							e100224	10.1371/journal.pone.0100224						WOS:000338280800030	24968138

Considerable biosignatures were present in summer DOM, yet with a near absence of algal extract compounds. Extensive molecular alteration resulting from multistep and massively parallel biotic and subordinated abiotic transformations of algal biomass to DOM included loss and synthesis of carbohydrates, fundamental changes of aromatic compounds and progressive formation of carboxyl-rich alicyclic compounds (CRAM). The DOM transformation from summer to fall resulted in smaller molecules, increased abundance of CHNO continuous molecular series and overall molecular diversity. Analysis of MS-derived compositional networks placed summer DOM in-between the algal extract and fall DOM. Metabolic pathway annotation by means of high-resolution mass analysis provided a wide range of pathways associated with secondary metabolites in DOM and more basic ones like carbohydrate metabolism characteristic of algal extract compounds. Overall, the time-dependent molecular signature of Taihu DOM was likely dominated by microbial metabolism rather than abiotic chemical transformations. Results from this study indicate that high-resolution organic structural spectroscopy resolves meaningful structural detail out of complex environmental mixtures and has the potential to contribute significantly to future functional biodiversity studies.

Concurrent photolytic degradation of aqueous methylmercury and dissolved organic matter	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Monomethyl mercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin that threatens ecosystem viability and human health. In aquatic systems, the photolytic degradation of MeHg (photodemethylation) is an important component of the MeHg cycle. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is also affected by exposure to solar radiation (light exposure) leading to changes in DOM composition that can affect its role in overall mercury (Hg) cycling. This study investigated changes in MeHg concentration, DOM concentration, and the optical signature of DOM caused by light exposure in a controlled field-based experiment using water samples collected from wetlands and rice fields. Filtered water from all sites showed a marked loss in MeHg concentration after light exposure. The rate of photodemethylation was 7.5 x 10(-3) m(2) mol(-1) (s.d. 3.5 x 10(-3)) across all sites despite marked differences in DOM concentration and composition. Light exposure also caused changes in the optical signature of the DOM despite there being no change in DOM concentration, indicating specific structures within the DOM were affected by light exposure at different rates. MeHg concentrations were related to optical signatures of labile DOM whereas the percent loss of MeHg was related to optical signatures of less labile, humic DOM. Relationships between the loss of MeHg and specific areas of the DOM optical signature indicated that aromatic and quinoid structures within the DOM were the likely contributors to MeHg degradation, perhaps within the sphere of the Hg-DOM bond. Because MeHg photodegradation rates are relatively constant across freshwater habitats with natural Hg-DOM ratios, physical characteristics such as shading and hydrologic residence time largely determine the relative importance of photolytic processes on the MeHg budget in these mixed vegetated and open-water systems.

Fluorescence spectroscopy, by means of Excitation-Emission Matrices (EEM), has become an indispensable tool to study DOM sources, transport and fate in aquatic ecosystems. However the statistical treatment of large and heterogeneous EEM data sets still represents an important challenge for biogeochemists. Recently, Self-Organising Maps (SOM) has been proposed as a tool to explore patterns in large EEM data sets. SOM is a pattern recognition method which clusterizes and reduces the dimensionality of input EEMs without relying on any assumption about the data structure. In this paper, we show how SOM, coupled with a correlation analysis of the component planes, can be used both to explore patterns among samples, as well as to identify individual fluorescence components. We analysed a large and heterogeneous EEM data set, including samples from a river catchment collected under a range of hydrological conditions, along a 60-km downstream gradient, and under the influence of different degrees of anthropogenic impact. According to our results, chemical industry effluents appeared to have unique and distinctive spectral characteristics. On the other hand, river samples collected under flash flood conditions showed homogeneous EEM shapes. The correlation analysis of the component planes suggested the presence of four fluorescence components, consistent with DOM components previously described in the literature. A remarkable strength of this methodology was that outlier samples appeared naturally integrated in the analysis. We conclude that SOM coupled with a correlation analysis procedure is a promising tool for studying large and heterogeneous EEM data sets.

Origin and Sources of Dissolved Organic Matter in Snow on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polar ice sheets hold a significant pool of the world's carbon reserve and are an integral component of the global carbon cycle. Yet, organic carbon composition and cycling in these systems is least understood. Here, we use ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to elucidate, at an unprecedented level, molecular details of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Antarctic snow. Tens of thousands of distinct molecular species are identified, providing clues to the nature and sources of organic carbon in Antarctica. We show that many of the identified supraglacial organic matter formulas are consistent with material from microbial sources, and terrestrial inputs of vascular plant-derived materials are likely more important sources of organic carbon to Antarctica than previously thought. Black carbon-like material apparently originating from biomass burning in South America is also present, while a smaller fraction originated from soil humics and appears to be photochemically or microbially modified. In addition to remote continental sources, we document signals of oceanic emissions of primary aerosols and secondary organic aerosol precursors. The new insights on the diversity of organic species in Antarctic snowpack reinforce the importance of studying organic carbon associated with the Earth's polar regions in the face of changing climate.

A new method, based on the theoretical link between the vertical attenuation coefficient, K-d, and the absorption coefficient, has been developed to assess a(cdom). This method, confirmed from radiative transfer simulations and in situ measurements, and tested on an independent in situ data set (N = 126), allows acdom to be assessed with a Mean Relative Absolute Difference, MRAD, of 33% over two order of magnitude (from 0.01 to 1.16 m(-1)). In the frame of ocean color observation, K-d is not directly measured but estimated from the remote sensing reflectance, R-rs. Based on 109 satellite (SeaWiFS) and in situ coincident (i.e. match-up) data points a(cdom) is retrieved with a MRAD value of 37%. This simple model generally presents slightly better performances than recently developed empirical or semi-analytical algorithms.

Dissolved organic matter in lysimetric water of mountain forest soils in the southern Sikhote Alin	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The fractional composition of dissolved organic matter and the chemical nature of humic and fulvic acids were studied in lysimetric waters from forest soils of different altitudinal zones in the Sikhote Alin Range. The elemental composition, infrared absorption spectra, concentrations of acid functional groups, and pK spectra of humic and fulvic acids were determined. Fulvic acids predominated in the upper soil horizons, and fraction of nonspecific dissolved organic substances predominated in the lower mineral horizons. The portion of humic acids in the humus horizons markedly decreased from the low-mountain soils to the high-mountain soils; the nitrogen content of humic and fulvic acids decreased in the same direction. Three classes of carboxyl and phenolic groups were determined in pK-spectra of humic and fulvic acids. The soils of high-mountain zones had stronger acidic properties of humic and fulvic acids in comparison with the soils of low-mountain zones. The determined characteristics of the composition of dissolved organic matter and the trends of their changes contribute to our knowledge of pedogenetic processes in the altitudinal sequence of forest landscapes of the Sikhote Alin Range.																	1064-2293	1556-195X				JUN	2014	47	6					581	590		10.1134/S1064229314060052						WOS:000338197300006

Phylogenetic and structural response of heterotrophic bacteria to dissolved organic matter of different chemical composition in a continuous culture study	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and heterotrophic bacteria are highly diverse components of the ocean system, and their interactions are key in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of major elements. How chemical and phylogenetic diversity are linked remains largely unexplored to date. To investigate interactions between bacterial diversity and DOM, we followed the response of natural bacterial communities to two sources of phytoplankton-derived DOM over six bacterial generation times in continuous cultures. Analyses of total hydrolysable neutral sugars and amino acids, and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed large differences in the chemical composition of the two DOM sources. According to 454 pyrosequences of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes, diatom-derived DOM sustained higher levels of bacterial richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity than cyanobacteria-derived DOM. These distinct community structures were, however, not associated with specific taxa. Grazing pressure affected bacterial community composition without changing the overall pattern of bacterial diversity levels set by DOM. Our results demonstrate that resource composition can shape several facets of bacterial diversity without influencing the phylogenetic composition of bacterial communities, suggesting functional redundancy at different taxonomic levels for the degradation of phytoplankton-derived DOM.				blain, stephane/F-6917-2010; Cottrell, Matthew/C-3266-2009; Obernosterer, Ingrid/A-5434-2011	blain, stephane/0000-0002-5234-2446; 												1462-2912	1462-2920				JUN	2014	16	6			SI		1668	1681		10.1111/1462-2920.12242						WOS:000337512000018	24020678

DOM and bromide were simultaneously removed by all selected AERs in batch adsorption experiments. A polyacrylic magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEX (R)) showed faster dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal than other AERs because it had the smallest resin bead size. Aromatic DOM fractions with molecular weight larger than 1600 Da and fluorescent organic fractions of fulvic acid- and humic acid-like compounds were efficiently removed by all AERs. Polystyrene AERs were more effective in bromide removal than polyacrylic AERs. This result implied that the properties of AERs, i.e. material and resin size, influenced not only DOM removal but also bromide removal efficiency. MIEX (R) showed significant chlorinated DBP removal because it had the highest DOC removal within 30 mm, whereas polystyrene AERs efficiently removed brominated DBPs, especially brominated trihalomethane species. The results suggested that, depending on source water DOM and bromide concentration, selecting a suitable AER is a key factor in effective control of chlorinated and brominated DBPs in drinking water.

J	Hur, J; Nguyen, HVM; Lee, BM				Hur, Jin; Hang Vo-Minh Nguyen; Lee, Bo-Mi			Influence of upstream land use on dissolved organic matter and trihalomethane formation potential in watersheds for two different seasons	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Different land uses of upstream catchments may affect the quantity and the quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in watersheds, but the influence may differ by season. In this study, we examined concentrations and selected spectroscopic properties of DOM and the propensity to form trihalomethanes (THMs) for 19 different middle-sized watersheds across the Han River basin in Korea. Sampling was conducted for non-storm events during pre-monsoon (May) and monsoon seasons (July). The anthropogenic land uses including agricultural and residential areas occupied 2.3 to 49.4 % of the upstream catchments of the watersheds. Non-aromatic, labile, and less condensed DOM structures were more abundant in the monsoon season. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling with fluorescence data demonstrated that a combination of three different fluorescence components could explain the seasonal and the spatial distributions of DOM characteristics. Terrestrial humic-like fluorescence was the most abundant component for all the DOM samples, while protein-like fluorescence became more pronounced for the monsoon season. THM concentrations did not differ between the two seasons. Observed seasonal differences in the concentrations and the characteristics of DOM suggested a greater contribution of groundwater to the streams in watersheds in the monsoon versus the pre-monsoon season. Significant correlations among anthropogenic land use, microbial humic-like fluorescence, and the propensity to form THMs were found only for the pre-monsoon season. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that, regardless of the season, anthropogenic land uses increased the concentrations of DOM and nutrients but that their effects on the DOM properties were not evident for the monsoon season.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2014	21	12					7489	7500		10.1007/s11356-014-2667-4						WOS:000337086300024	24595751	
J	Phong, DD; Lee, Y; Shin, KH; Hur, J				Diep Dinh Phong; Lee, Yeonjung; Shin, Kyung-Hoon; Hur, Jin			Spatial variability in chromophoric dissolved organic matter for an artificial coastal lake (Shiwha) and the upstream catchments at two different seasons	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Selected water quality parameters and spectroscopic characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were examined during two different seasons for an artificial coastal lake (Shiwha Lake in South Korea), which are affected by seawater exchange due to the operation of a tidal power plant and external organic loadings from the upstream catchments. The coastal lake exhibited much lower concentrations of organic matter and nutrients than the upstream sources. The spectroscopic properties of the lake DOM were easily distinguished from those of the catchment sources as revealed by a lower absorption coefficient, lower degree of humification, and higher spectral slopes. The observed DOM properties suggest that the lake DOM may be dominated by smaller molecular size and less condensed structures. For the lake and the upper streams, higher absorption coefficients and fluorescence peak intensities but lower spectral slopes and humification index were found for the premonsoon versus the monsoon season. However, such seasonal differences were less pronounced for the industrial channels in the upper catchments. Three distinctive fluorophore groups including microbial humic-like, tryptophan-like, and terrestrial humic-like fluorescence were decomposed from the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) of the DOM samples by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling. The microbial humic-like component was the most abundant for the industrial channels, suggesting that the component may be associated with anthropogenic organic pollution. The terrestrial humic-like component was predominant for the upper streams, and its relative abundance was higher for the rainy season. Our principal component analysis (PCA) results demonstrated that exchange of seawater and seasonally variable input of allochthonous DOM plays important roles in determining the characteristics of DOM in the lake.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2014	21	12					7678	7688		10.1007/s11356-014-2704-3						WOS:000337086300044	24622988

Results showed that the soil DOM mainly consisted of three components, fulvic acid-like (Cl), humic acid-like (C2) and protein-like (C3), with Cl as the majority one. The distribution of DOM in space was also studied. In vertical direction, Cl and C2 decreased significantly with the increase in soil depth, while C3 component decreased after increased. The humification coefficient decreased fast from 0 similar to 20 to 30 similar to 40 cm, and then increased from 30 similar to 40 to 40 similar to 50 cm. In the horizontal direction, the level of C2 component varied greatly in space, while that of Cl component changed little, and that of C3 component fell in between the above two. The change in the humification degree of each soil layer significantly varied spatially. Humification process of soil organic matter mainly occurred in the surface soil layer. In addition, the humification degree in space also changed significantly. The new ideas of this study are: (1) Analyze the composition and spatial heterogeneity of soil DOM in the vegetable greenhouse; (2) Use three dimensional fluorescence spectra technology and parallel factor analysis model successfully to quantify the components of soil DOM, which provides a new method for the soil DOM analysis.																	1000-0593					JUN	2014	34	6					1582	1588		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)06-1582-07						WOS:000336883300029

There were distinct differences in the concentration and MW fractions of DOM, and the two measures were correlated. Fraction MW > 5 kDa was the major component of DOM in all mature composts. Determined 5 day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of DOM was correlated to the concentration of DOM and all MW fractions except MW > 5 kDa, indicating that the biodegradability of DOM was a function of the content and proportion of fraction MW < 5 kDa. This study suggests that the amount and distribution of low MW fractions affect DOM biodegradability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The photodegradation of both DOM and particulate organic matter (POM) leads to the formation of carbon monoxide and/or the production of labile organic matter that can be rapidly biodegraded. DOM also regulates metal speciation, particularly important for the bioavailability of nutrient metals required by phytoplankton. Copper is one of these essential nutrients but is also toxic in elevated concentrations. Its speciation is regulated by DOM photodegradation however, DOM-copper ligands are not well characterized because of their low concentrations in natural waters. Copper immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to isolate high and low affinity DOM ligands from both Pacific near-shore seawater and freshwater from the Black River (NC). Laser flash photolysis (LFP) was used to characterize excited state species from these fractions and to identify excited state species in the open ocean through a depth profile from 5 to 4532 m (North Atlantic, Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station (BATS)). LFP generated transients characteristic of the solvated electron (T = 3.5 +/- 0.1 mu s), a microbial-sourced triplet excited state (T = 1.1 mu s +/- 0.1 mu s), and a long-lived transient, DOM*, with a millisecond lifetime. Unlike the seawater triplet excited state, a copper ligand from Black River water generated a triplet excited state with a lifetime of 3.4 +/- 0.1 mu s. Fractions were also characterized by excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEMs), UV-visible, and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. EEMs spectra correlated the marine excited state species with the protein-like, microbial fraction while the freshwater transients were associated with chromophoric DOM (CDOM). H-1 NMR with spectral database matching identified ninety-seven compounds as potential sources of these excited state species in the Pacific seawater IMAC fractions. Aqueous extracts of marine macro-algae (Sargassum natans (Atlantic Ocean), Macrocystis pyrifera), and surf grass (Phyllospadix torreyi) were analyzed to investigate potential additional sources of these excited state transients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize DOM-copper ligands in seawater using a combination of EEMs, NMR and laser flash photolysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microbial degradation of terrigenous dissolved organic matter and potential consequences for carbon cycling in brown-water streams	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Streams receive substantial terrestrial deliveries of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The chromophoric (CDOM) fraction of terrestrial deliveries confers the brown colour to streamwater, often understood as browning, and plays a central role in aquatic photochemistry and is generally considered resistant to microbial metabolism. To assess the relevance of terrigenous DOM for carbon fluxes mediated by stream microorganisms, we determined the bioavailable fraction of DOM and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), and related these measures to partial pressure of CO2 in headwater streams spanning across a browning gradient. Fluorescence and absorbance analyses revealed high molecular weight and aromaticity, and elevated contributions from humic-like components to characterize terrestrial CDOM. We found that microorganisms metabolized this material at the cost of low CUE and shifted its composition (from fluorescence and absorbance) towards less aromatic and low-molecular weight compounds. Respiration (from CUE) was related to CO2 supersaturation in streams and this relationship was modulated by DOM composition. Our findings imply that terrigenous DOM is respired by microorganisms rather than incorporated into their biomass, and that this channelizes terrigenous carbon to the pool of CO2 potentially outgassing from streams into the atmosphere. This finding may gain relevance as major terrigenous carbon stores become mobilized and browning progresses.

WATER RESEARCH												Surface freshwater samples from Everglades National Park, Florida, were used to investigate the size distributions of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) and associated fluorescence characteristics along the molecular weight continuum. Samples were fractionated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and characterized by spectroscopic means, in particular Excitation-Emission Matrix fluorescence modeled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Most of the eight components obtained from PARAFAC modeling were broadly distributed across the DOM molecular weight range, and the optical properties of the eight size fractions for all samples studied were quite consistent among each other. Humic-like components presented a similar distribution in all the samples, with enrichment in the middle molecular weight range. Some variability in the relative distribution of the different humic-like components was observed among the different size fractions and among samples. The protein like fluorescence, although also generally present in all fractions, was more variable but generally enriched in the highest and lowest molecular weight fractions. These observations are in agreement with the hypothesis of a supramolecular structure for DOM, and suggest that DOM fluorescence characteristics may be controlled by molecular assemblies with similar optical properties, distributed along the molecular weight continuum. This study highlights the importance of studying the molecular structure of DOM on a molecular size distribution perspective, which may have important implications in understanding the environmental dynamics such materials.

Little is known about the fate of PBDEs in Arctic surface waters, especially in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM has been shown to interact with hydrophobic organic contaminants and can alter their mobility, bioavailability, and degradation in the environment. In this study, the partitioning of six PBDE congeners between Arctic DOM (isolated via solid phase extraction) and water was measured using the aqueous solubility enhancement method. Measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-water partition coefficient (K-DOC) values were nearly an order of magnitude lower than previously reported values for the same PBDE congeners in soil or commercial organic matter, ranging from 10(3.97) to 10(5.16) L kg(-1) of organic carbon. Measured results compared favorably with values calculated using polyparameter linear free energy models for Suwannee River fulvic acid. Log K-DOC values increased with increasing PBDE hydrophobicity. Slightly lower than expected values were observed for the highest brominated congeners, which we attribute to steric hindrance. This study is the first to comprehensively measure K-DOC values for a range of PBDE congeners with DOM isolated from Arctic surface waters.

J	Janssen, EML; Erickson, PR; McNeill, K				Janssen, Elisabeth M. -L.; Erickson, Paul R.; McNeill, Kristopher			Dual Roles of Dissolved Organic Matter as Sensitizer and Quencher in the Photooxidation of Tryptophan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The photooxidation processes of tryptophan (Trp) in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were identified and quantified by steady-state photolysis experiments, laser spectroscopy and kinetic modeling. In sunlight, Trp photooxidation is dominated by the reaction with excited triplet DOM ((DOM)-D-3), accounting for approximately 50-70% of the total degradation, depending on the DOM concentration and source. Reaction with singlet oxygen and direct photolysis are secondary processes that are both still more important than the reaction with hydroxyl radical. Both direct photolysis and reaction with 3DOM form Trp radical cation (Trp(center dot+)) via Trp photoionization and direct oxidation, respectively. The Trp(center dot+) can be converted back to Trp by suitable electron or hydrogen atom donors. Transient absorption spectroscopy shows that DOM itself and low-molecular-weight analogues of redox-active moieties can reduce the lifetime of photochemically produced Trp(center dot+) and thus quench Trp degradation. This study demonstrates that DOM plays dual roles in the photodegradation of Trp acting as a sensitizer and quencher. The photochemistry of Trp and the participation of DOM have direct implications for photochemical reactions in extracellular proteins as well as for organic compounds in aquatic systems with similar photoionization processes.

Effect of Chemical Oxidation on the Sorption Tendency of Dissolved Organic Matter to a Model Hydrophobic Surface	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The application of chemical oxidants may alter the sorption properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM), such as humic and fulvic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, affecting their fate in water treatment processes, including attachment to other organic components, activated carbon, and membranes (e.g., organic fouling). Similar reactions with chlorine (HOCl) and bromine (HOBr) produced at inflammatory sites in vivo affect the fate of biomolecules (e.g., protein aggregation). In this study, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used to evaluate changes in the noncovalent interactions of proteins, polysaccharides, fatty acids, and humic and fulvic acids with a model hydrophobic surface as a function of increasing doses of HOCl, HOBr, and ozone (O-3). All three oxidants enhanced the sorption tendency of proteins to the hydrophobic surface at low doses but reduced their sorption tendency at high doses. All three oxidants reduced the sorption tendency of polysaccharides and fatty acids to the hydrophobic surface. HOCl and HOBr increased the sorption tendency of humic and fulvic acids to the hydrophobic surface with maxima at moderate doses, while O-3 decreased their sorption tendency. The behavior observed with two water samples was similar to that observed with humic and fulvic acids, pointing to the importance of these constituents. For chlorination, the highest sorption tendency to the hydrophobic surface was observed within the range of doses typically applied during water treatment. These results suggest that ozone pretreatment would minimize membrane fouling by DOM, while chlorine pretreatment would promote DOM removal by activated carbon.

J	Lee, MH; Hur, J				Lee, Mi-Hee; Hur, Jin			Photodegradation-Induced Changes in the Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Matter with Different Sources and Their Effects on Disinfection By-Product Formation Potential	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												Changes in the apparent characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) upon photodegradation and their influences on disinfection by-products formation potentials (DBPFP) were examined using biodegraded DOM from six different sources (leaf litter, algae, compost, paddy water, treated sewage, and headwater). After seven day UV irradiation, no substantial changes occurred in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, but significant decreases were observed for the specific UV absorbance. In general, fulvic-like and humic-like fluorophores appear to be more affected by photodegradation than protein-like fluorophores (or DOM components) and/or than the DOM structures associated with a shorter excitation wavelength. Size exclusion chromatograms revealed that UV absorbing molecules of intermediate size ranging from 1 to 5kDa were most vulnerable to the UV irradiation. Except for leaf litter-derived DOM, UV irradiation did not lead to substantial changes in specific DBPFP (i.e. disinfection by-product (DBP)/dissolved organic carbon) comparable to those of the DOM characteristics, suggesting that many of the DBP precursors were not easily removed by photodegradation or some photochemically produced compounds could operate as DBP precursors. All the DOM samples exhibited greater formation potential for haloacetic acids per organic carbon than trihalomethanes irrespective of the sources. In general, correlations between DOM properties and specific DBPFP became stronger after photodegradation. The intermediate sized UV-absorbing moieties appear to be actively involved in forming DBPs for photodegraded DOM. An integrated region of protein-like fluorescence intensities may be suggested as an estimation index for specific DBPFP independent of the DOM sources.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				MAY	2014	42	5					552	560		10.1002/clen.201200685						WOS:000337514900003

The South Branch is the dominant pathway of Changjiang River discharge, while the shallower and narrower North Branch is dominated by salt water intrusion, especially in the dry season. Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy were measured along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations to characterize the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected in different seasons during an extreme drought year in 2011. The refractory DOM from the Changjiang River flowed mainly through the South Branch, whereas in the lower South Branch, the input from the polluted Huangpu River contributed a large amount of biolabile DOM, demonstrating an anthropogenic perturbation from megacities. The DOM properties in the North Branch showed conservative behavior in the wet season, while noticeable addition was observed in the dry season, accompanied by the reversed flux of DOM from the North Branch to the South Branch, emphasizing the regular seasonal oscillation of the DOM dynamics in this monsoon-controlled bifurcated estuary. The estuarine turbidity maximum zones played distinct roles on DOM dynamics in different estuarine environments. The DOC and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) abundance in the Changjiang River and other Chinese rivers were at lower levels compared to other world rivers, showing a characteristic of the regional CDOM-poor features for many East Asia rivers.

Chemodiversity of dissolved organic matter in lakes driven by climate and hydrology	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Despite the small continental coverage of lakes, they are hotspots of carbon cycling, largely due to the processing of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). As DOM is an amalgam of heterogeneous compounds comprising gradients of microbial and physicochemical reactivity, the factors influencing DOM processing at the molecular level and the resulting patterns in DOM composition are not well understood. Here we show, using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to unambiguously identify 4,032 molecular formulae in 120 lakes across Sweden, that the molecular composition of DOM is shaped by precipitation, water residence time and temperature. Terrestrially derived DOM is selectively lost as residence time increases, with warmer temperatures enhancing the production of nitrogen-containing compounds. Using biodiversity concepts, we show that the molecular diversity of DOM, or chemodiversity, increases with DOM and nutrient concentrations. The observed molecular-level patterns indicate that terrestrially derived DOM will become more prevalent in lakes as climate gets wetter.

This study aimed to analyse direct production of FDOM by marine phytoplankton cultures and reveal fluorescent characteristics of exuded FDOM. Axenic cultures of eight species of bloom-forming marine phytoplankton, including two diatoms; a raphidophyte; two dinoflagellates; a chlorophyte; a cryptophyte and a haptophyte, were incubated in an artificial medium. Excitation emission matrices (EEMs) of FDOM in the culture medium were spectrofluorometrically measured. FDOM production was observed in all species, and fluorescent characteristics of the exudates varied considerably among species. Measured EEMs had peaks at 350/450 nm (excitation/emission) for the diatom Ditylum brightwellii and 370/450-470 nm for the raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo and the chlorophyte Oltmansiellopsis viridis, which have previously been regarded as the peaks of terrestrially derived humic-like substances. Direct production of FDOM by marine phytoplankton should be considered in future studies of FDOM dynamics in marine systems. Species-specific features of FDOM might be used for early detection of harmful blooms because this method is simple, rapid and suitable for monitoring.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2014	36	3					685	694		10.1093/plankt/fbu015						WOS:000336490000008

In this study, fluorescent excitation-emission matrix-parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis and two-dimensional (2D) FTIR correlation spectroscopy were firstly used to explore chemical changes of soluble intermediates in high-solid biogas reactor. EEM-PARAFAC showed that fluorescent components (tyrosine-like, tryptophan-like and humic-like groups) in DOM over time increased gradually, implying that these groups were reluctant to biodegrade (acidogenesis). The resistance to biodegradation presented the following order: humic-like group > tyrosine-like group > tryptophan-like group. 2D FTIR correlation spectroscopy indicated that the DOM change sequence with time followed the order: protein-like groups > structural carbohydrates and carboxylic acids > polysaccharides-like groups. Fluorescence intensities from EEM-PARAFAC and main bands of FTIR spectra correlated significantly with other chemical parameters, e. g. biogas production and dissolved organic carbon content. These findings supply novel realization for degradation degree and order of individual DOMs during anaerobic digestion for dewatered sewage sludge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jamieson, T; Sager, E; Gueguen, C				Jamieson, Tyler; Sager, Eric; Gueguen, Celine			Characterization of biochar-derived dissolved organic matter using UV-visible absorption and excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopies	CHEMOSPHERE												In recent years, biochar has become of considerable interest for a variety of environmental applications. However, the feasibility of its application is entirely dependent on its physical and chemical properties, including the characteristics of biochar-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). The goal of this study was to assess the use of optical analysis for the purpose of characterizing biochar-derived DOM. Three different biochars (slow pyrolysis birch and maple; fast pyrolysis maple) were produced and leached in distilled water over 17 d. Samples were taken on days 3, 10, 13 and 17, filtered, and analyzed for DOC content. Samples were also subjected to optical analysis using UV-visible absorption and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopies. EEM fluorescence data were further analyzed using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Absorbance and fluorescence results were combined and examined using principal component analysis (PCA). Significant differences in the water soluble organic carbon content were observed for all biochar types. The estimated aromaticity (SUVA(254)) and mean molecular weight (S275-295) of biochar-derived DOM were also found to differ based on biochar type. PARAFAC analysis identified three humic-like components and one protein-like component. Distinct DOM signatures were observed for each biochar type. Transformations in biochar DOM characteristics over time were also observed. The PCA showed a clear delineation in biochar types based on their optical properties. The results of this study indicate that optical analysis may provide valuable information regarding the characteristics of biochar-derived DOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yan, MQ; Li, DC; Gao, JF; Cheng, JX				Yan, Mingquan; Li, Dechao; Gao, Junfa; Cheng, Jixia			Influence of chlorination on metal binding by dissolved organic matter: A study using Log-transformed differential spectra	CHEMOSPHERE												This study employed the method of Log-transformed absorbance spectroscopy to probe interactions of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and Aldrich humic acid (AHA) affected by chlorination with Fe(III), and Cu(II) ions. Cl-2/DOC ratios of 0.2 and 1.0 (mg/mg) were selected to represent chlorine doses that are commonly used in pre-chlorination and disinfection in water treatment processes. Spectroscopic data were interpreted based on non-ideal competitive adsorption coupled with a Donnan electrostatic sub-model (NICA-Donnan model) that was employed to quantify the constants describing relevant cornplexation equilibria. The data demonstrated that effects of chlorination on dissolved organic matter (DOM) and metal interactions depend on the metal, chlorine dose and intrinsic DOM properties. Fe(III) was observed to form strong complexes with DOM and relatively little change of Fe(III) binding were observed both SRFA and AHA affected by chlorine. The amount of bound Al(III) decreased significantly at high total Al(III) concentrations (>5 mu M) due to the reducing of phenolic groups after chlorination. The amount of bound Al(111) decreased only slightly for chlorinated SRFA but for AHA Al(111) binding increased at low total Al concentrations (<1 mu M) due to the generation of additional carboxylic groups after chlorination. It is different from Fe(III) and AI(III), the dominant involvement of Cu-DOM binding is carboxylic groups in both fulvic and humic acid, especially for humic acid, the increase of carboxylic group after chlorination for SRFA at low Cl-2 dose and for AHA at both low and high dose lead to increase the total amount of bound Cu(ll).

The sorption-desorption and transport of four commonly used VPs including trimethoprim (TMP), sulfapyridine, sulfameter, and sulfadimethoxine were investigated in three soil layers taken from an agricultural field in Chongming Island China and two types of aqueous solution (0.01 M CaCl2 solution and wastewater treatment plant effluent). Results from sorption-desorption experiments showed that the sorption behavior of selected VPs conformed to the Freundlich isotherm equation. TMP exhibited higher distribution coefficients (K (d) = 6.73-9.21) than other sulfonamides (K (d) = 0.03-0.47), indicating a much stronger adsorption capacity of TMP. The percentage of desorption for TMP in a range of 8-12 % is not so high to be considered significant. Low pH (< pK (a) of tested VPs) and rich soil organic matter (e.g., 0-20 cm soil sample) had a positive impact on sorption of VPs. Slightly lower distribution coefficients were obtained for VPs in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, which suggested that dissolved organic matter might affect their sorption behavior. Column studies indicated that the transport of VPs in the soil column was mainly influenced by sorption capacity. The weakly adsorbed sulfonamides had a high recovery rate (63.6-98.0 %) in the leachate, while the recovery rate of TMP was only 4.2-10.4 %. The sulfonamides and TMP exhibited stronger retaining capacity in 20-80 cm and 0-20 cm soil samples, respectively. The transport of VPs was slightly higher in the columns leached by WWTP effluent than by CaCl2 solution (0.01 M) due to their sorption interactions.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2014	21	9					5827	5835		10.1007/s11356-014-2493-8						WOS:000334684700008	24443047

Spectroscopic characterisation of dissolved organic matter changes in drinking water treatment: From PARAFAC analysis to online monitoring wavelengths	WATER RESEARCH												Organic matter (OM) causes many problems in drinking water treatment. It is difficult to monitor OM concentrations and character during treatment processes due to its complexity. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a promising tool for online monitoring. In this study, a unique dataset of fluorescence excitation emission matrixes (EEMs) (n = 867) was collected from all treatment stages of five drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) situated in diverse locations from subtropical to temperate climate. The WTPs incorporated various water sources, treatment processes and OM removal efficiencies (DOC removal 0%-68%). Despite these differences, four common fluorescence PARAFAC components were identified for characterisation of OM concentration and treatability. Moreover, fluorescence component ratios showed site-specific statistically significant correlations with OM removal, which contrasted with correlations between specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA) and OM removal that were not statistically significant. This indicates that use of fluorescence spectroscopy may be a more robust alternative for predicting DOC removal than UV spectroscopy. Based on the identified fluorescence components, four optical locations were selected in order to move towards single wavelength online OM monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We studied the dynamics of DOM in a Mediterranean lagoon dominated by seasonal submerged vegetation and receiving torrential freshwater inputs. In order to trace changes in DOM quality throughout the year in relation with potential DOM sources, we used spectroscopic techniques including UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. The quality of the lagoon DOM fluctuates on a seasonal basis between the characteristics of torrential inputs and macrophytes. Humification and aromaticity of DOM increased markedly after the torrential inputs of materials derived from terrestrial vegetation and soils in the catchment. The macrophytes in the lagoon contributed with less humified materials and protein-like compounds. Other minor processes such as seawater entrances, photodegradation or temporary bottom hypoxia translated into sporadic DOM quality changes. These results highlight the need of a whole ecosystem approach to understand changes in DOM quality due to ecosystem processes that might otherwise be exclusively attributed to DOM reactivity.

The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, it was concluded that the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and trichloroacetic acids. The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes.

By applying the three methods to common water samples, the efficiencies of XAD, PPL and RO/ED DOM isolation were compared. XAD recovered 42% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from deep water (25% with XAD-8; 17% with XAD-4) and 30% from surface water (16% with XAD-8; 14% with XAD-4). PPL recovered 61 +/- 3% of DOC from deep water and 61% from surface water. RO/ED recovered 82 +/- 3% of DOC from deep water, 14 +/- 3% of which was recovered in a sodium hydroxide rinse, and 75 +/- 5% of DOC from surface water, with 12 +/- 2% in the sodium hydroxide rinse. The highest recoveries of all were achieved by the sequential isolation of DOC, first with PPL and then via RO/ED. This combined technique recovered 98% of DOC from a deep water sample and 101% of DOC from a surface water sample. In total, 1.9, 10.3 and 1.6 g-C of DOC were collected via XAD. PPL and RO/ED, respectively. Rates of DOC recovery using the XAD, PPL and RO/ED methods were 10,33 and 10 mg-C h(-1), respectively. Based upon C/N ratios, XAD isolates were heavily C-enriched compared with water column DOM, whereas RO/ED and PPL -> RO/ED isolate C/N values were most representative of the original DOM. All techniques are suitable for the isolation of large amounts of DOM with purities suitable for most advanced analytical techniques. Coupling PPL and RO/ED techniques may provide substantial progress in the search for a method to quantitatively isolate oceanic DOC, bringing the entirety of the DOM pool within the marine chemist's analytical window.

The fluorescent fraction of DOM can be used to trace the formation of recalcitrant DOM (RDOM). A long-term (> 1year) experiment revealed 27-52% removal of dissolved organic carbon and a nonlinear increase in RDOM fluorescence associated with microbial turnover of semilabile DOM. This fluorescence was also produced using glucose as the only initial carbon source, suggesting that degradation of prokaryote remnants contributes to RDOM. Our results indicate that the formation of a fluorescent RDOM component depends on the bioavailability of the substrate: the less labile, the larger the production of fluorescent RDOM relative to organic carbon remineralized. The anticipated increase in microbial carbon demand due to ocean warming can potentially force microbes to degrade less labile substrates, thereby increasing RDOM production and stimulating ocean carbon storage.

Formation of bromate in sulfate radical based oxidation: Mechanistic aspects and suppression by dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												Sulfate radical based oxidation is discussed being a potential alternative to hydroxyl radical based oxidation for pollutant control in water treatment. However, formation of undesired by-products, has hardly been addressed in the current literature, which is an issue in other oxidative processes such as bromate formation in ozonation of bromide containing water (US-EPA and EU drinking water standard of bromate: 10 mu g L-1). Sulfate radicals react fast with bromide (k = 3.5 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) which could also yield bromate as final product. The mechanism of bromate formation in aqueous solution in presence of sulfate radicals has been investigated in the present paper. Further experiments were performed in presence of humic acids and in surface water for investigating the relevance of bromate formation in context of pollutant control. The formation of bromate by sulfate radicals resembles the well described mechanism of the hydroxyl radical based bromate formation. In both cases hypobromous acid is a requisite intermediate. In presence of organic matter formation of bromate is effectively suppressed. That can be explained by formation of superoxide formed in the reaction of sulfate radicals plus aromatic moieties of organic matter, since superoxide reduces hypobromous acid yielding bromine atoms and bromide. Hence formation of bromate can be neglected in sulfate radical based oxidation at typical conditions of water treatment. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the effects of preparative tDOM isolation on microbial decomposition were investigated in incubation experiments consisting of mesocosms containing mesohaline water from the Baltic Sea. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) consumption, molecular DOM composition, bacterial activities, and shifts in bacterial community structure were compared between mesocosms supplemented with riverine tDOM, either as filtered, particle-free river water or as a concentrate obtained by lyophilization/tangential ultrafiltration, and those containing only Baltic Sea water or river water. As shown using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (15 Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) covering approximately 4600 different DOM compounds, the three DOM preparation protocols resulted in distinct patterns of molecular DOM composition. However, despite DOC losses of 4-16% and considerable bacterial production, there was no significant change in DOM composition during the 28-day experiment. Moreover, tDOM addition affected neither DOC degradation nor bacterial dynamics significantly, regardless of the tDOM preparation. This result suggested that the introduced tDOM was largely not bioavailable, at least on the temporal scale of our experiment, and that the observed bacterial activity and DOC decomposition mainly reflected the degradation of unknown, labile, colloidal and low-molecular weight DOM, both of which escape the analytical window of FT-ICR-MS. In contrast to the different tDOM preparations, the initial bacterial inoculum and batch culture conditions determined bacterial community succession and superseded the effects of tDOM addition. The uncoupling of tDOM and bacterial dynamics suggests that mesohaline bacterial communities cannot efficiently utilize tDOM and that in subarctic estuaries other factors are responsible for the removal of imported tDOM.

Our objective was to investigate the changes in chemical composition and spectral characteristics of DOM from soils under four different vegetation types, including evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest, dwarf forest, and alpine meadow along an elevation gradient in the Wuyi Mountains of southeastern China during a 90-day incubation with UV, fluorescence, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic techniques. In synchronous fluorescence spectra, the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of fulvic acid-like materials in DOM decreased for evergreen broad-leaved forest and dwarf forest soils after incubation, indicating that fulvic acids, especially when abundant at high initial content, seemed to be an important C source for soil microorganisms. The RFI of humic acid-like materials in DOM increased for all the samples after incubation, indicating that humic acids were resistant to biodegradation. The RFI of protein-like materials in DOM increased for all cases after incubation. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the ratio of absorption intensity of aromatic C=C to that of carbohydrate C-O in DOM increased by twofold to threefold after incubation for all the samples. Increasing values of UV254 absorbance and Humification Index of DOM were found for soils under most vegetation types after incubation. Carbohydrate C concentrations showed a larger fluctuation throughout the incubation, with a change of between 4.5 and 10.4 mg C L-1. Phenol C concentrations increased significantly for all cases. These results indicate that aromatic compounds with an enhanced degree of condensation were accumulated gradually during DOM biodegradation, and that there were considerable amounts of carbohydrates and protein-like materials in the residual DOM.																	0038-075X	1538-9243				APR	2014	179	4					197	204		10.1097/SS.0000000000000057						WOS:000342072400004		
J	Ou, HS; Wei, CH; Deng, Y; Gao, NY				Ou, Hua-Se; Wei, Chao-Hai; Deng, Yang; Gao, Nai-Yun			Integrated Principal Component Analysis of Microcystis aeruginosa Dissolved Organic Matter and Assessment of UV-C Pre-Treatment on Cyanobacteria-Containing Water	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The intrinsic characteristic of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and bioactivity materials derived from toxic Microcystis aeruginosa was investigated. Fluorescence excitation emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) determined six CDOM components, and principal component analysis (PCA) identified two integrated principle factors. PCA factor 1 mainly represented the intracellular and extracellular microbial active components, and factor 2 represented the extracellular residuals and degraded products. These two PCA factors accounted for 53 and 31% of the variance in nine parameters distributions, and were used to assess the variation pattern of DOM. The variation tendencies of PCA factors in experiments using single UV-C (254nm), UV-C/H2O2, UV-C/HCO3-, UV-C/NO3-, and UV-C/humic acid were estimated. Photolysis and photo-oxidation were dominating processes in single UV-C irradiation, and H2O2 improved photo-oxidation, resulting in high efficient removal of intracellular DOM and extracellular DOM. The presences of HCO3-, NO3- and humic acid had negative effects on the degradation of extracellular DOM, but little influence on intracellular DOM. Results revealed that UV-C/H2O2 can be considered as an option for the pretreatment of cyanobacteria-contained water, and EEM-PARAFAC-PCA can be applied to simplify multiple parameters in water treatment process, which would be benefit to water quality monitoring and management.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				APR	2014	42	4					442	448		10.1002/clen.201200628						WOS:000333679100009

Based on these data, an organic alkalinity contribution (A(org)) was determined, defined as the difference between measured A(T) and the inorganic alkalinity calculated from C-T and pH and/or C-T and pCO(2). A(org) was in the range of 22-58 mu mol kg(-1), corresponding to 1.5-3.5% of A(T). The method to determine Am was validated in an experiment performed on DOM-enriched river water samples collected from the mouths of the Vistula and Oder Rivers in May 2012. The A(org) increase determined in that experiment correlated directly with the increased DOC concentration caused by enrichment of the >1 kDa DOM fraction. To examine the effect of A(org) on calculations of the marine CO2 system, the pCO(2) and pH values measured in Baltic Sea water were compared with calculated values that were based on the measured alkalinity and another variable of the CO2 system, but ignored the existence of Am. Large differences between measured and calculated pCO(2) and pH were obtained when the computations were based on A(T) and C-T. The calculated pCO(2) was 27-56% lower than the measured value whereas the calculated pH was overestimated by more than 0.4 pH units. Since biogeochemical models are based on the transport and transformations of A(T) and C-T, the acid-base properties of DOM should be included in calculations of the CO2 system in DOM-rich basins like the Baltic Sea. In view of our limited knowledge about the composition and acid/base properties of DOM, this is best achieved using a bulk dissociation constant, K-DOM, that represents all weakly acidic functional groups present in DOM. Our preliminary results indicated that the bulk K-DOM in the Baltic Sea is 2.94 . 10(-8) mol kg(-1). Although this K-DOM has no thermodynamic meaning, it can be a useful tool in numerical studies as it allows an approximation of A(org) in seawater. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their activity in systems where xenobiotics occur as micropollutants (gL(-1) level) and natural dissolved organic matter provides carbon and energy instead remains uncharacterized. Biofilm formation of a bacterial consortium consisting of the linuron-degrading Variovorax sp. WDL1 and metabolite-degrading strains Comamonas sp. WDL7 and Hyphomicrobium sp. WDL6 at micropollutant linuron concentrations and the impact of auxiliary carbon sources on degradation and biofilm composition were investigated. Biofilms formed at concentrations of 1000, 100, and 10gL(-1) linuron. The highest biomass, organized in mixed-species mounds, was observed at 1000gL(-1) linuron, while at 100 and 10gL(-1), thin layers of cells occurred. Linuron removal efficiencies decreased from c. 85% when fed with 100 and 1000gL(-1) linuron to 30% in case of 10gL(-1) linuron due to reduced specific activity. Biofilms grown on 10gL(-1) linuron were subsequently fed with easily and less degradable carbon sources in addition to 10gL(-1) linuron. Although co-feeding with more degradable C-sources increased biofilm biomass, linuron removal remained 30%. Calculations based on biofilm volume measurements pointed toward reduced specific activity, compensated by a higher biomass. Uncertainties about biofilm heterogeneity and cell volume can undo this explanation.																	0168-6496	1574-6941				APR	2014	88	1					184	194		10.1111/1574-6941.12280						WOS:000333707200015	24410802

(Mel)			Effect of Wildfires on Physicochemical Changes of Watershed Dissolved Organic Matter	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Physicochemical characterization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) provides essential data to describe watershed characteristics after drastic changes caused by wildfires. Post-fire watershed behavior is important for water source selection, management, and drinking water treatment optimization. Using ash and other burned vegetation fragments, a leaching procedure was implemented to describe physicochemical changes to watershed DOC caused by wildfires. Samples were collected after the 2007 and 2009 wildfires near Santa Barbara, California. Substantial differences in size distribution (measured by ultrafiltration), polarity (measured by polarity rapid assessment method), and the origin of leached DOC (measured by fluorescence) were observed between burned and unburned sites. Recently burned ash had 10 times the DOC leaching potential, and was dominated by large size fragments, compared to weathered 2-year-old ash. Charged DOC fractions were found to positively correlate with DOC size, whereas hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOC fractions were not. Proteins were only observed in recently burned ash and were indicative of recent post-fire biological activity.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				APR	2014	86	4					372	381		10.2175/106143013X13736496909671						WOS:000334590400011	24851334

From the linear relationship between the humic-like peak intensities (excitation/emission = 305 nm/430 nm) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the water samples extending from the Selenga River mouth to offshore (central lake in the south basin), allochthonous DOM appeared to be a main contributor to the DOC concentrations. However, DOM with fewer fluorophores dominated in the South Basin of the lake at stable DOC concentrations of ca. 0.84 mg C l(-1). Meanwhile, FT-ICR MS analysis and subsequent principal component analysis across the transect revealed a transition of compounds with high H-deficiency (aromatic) to compounds with low H-deficiency (aliphatic) that dominate pelagic open-lake water. We believe that this molecular change is induced by photo-degradation, which mainly alters aromatic compounds.

J	Yi, YY; Zheng, AR; Guo, WD; Yang, LY; Chen, D				Yi Yueyuan; Zheng Airong; Guo Weidong; Yang Liyang; Chen Ding			Optical properties of estuarine dissolved organic matter isolated using cross-flow ultrafiltration	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from freshwater, mid-salinity, and seawater endmember samples in the Jiulong River Estuary, China were fractionated using cross-flow ultraffitration with a 10-kDa membrane. The colloidal organic matter (COM; 10 kDa-0.22 mu m) retentate, low molecular weight (LMW) DOM (<10 kDa) permeate, and bulk samples were analyzed using absorption spectroscopy and three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission-matrix spectroscopy. The UV-visible spectra of COM were very similar to those obtained for permeate and bulk samples, decreasing monotonically with increasing wavelength. Most of the chromophoric DOM (CDOM, expressed as the absorption coefficient a(355)) occurred in the LMVV fraction, while the percentage of CDOM in the colloidal fraction was substantially higher in the freshwater endmember (13.4% of the total) than in the seawater endmember (6.8%). The bulk CDOM showed a conservative mixing behavior in the estuary, while there was removal of the COM fraction and a concurrent addition of the permeate fraction in the mid-salinity sample, implying that part of the colloidal CDOM was transformed into LMVV CDOM. Two humic-like components (Cl: <250, 325/402 nm; and C2: 265, 360/458 nm) and one protein-like component (C3: 275/334 nm) were identified using parallel factor analysis. The contributions of the Cl, C2, and C3 components of the COM fraction to the bulk sample were 2.5%-8.7%, 4.8%-12.6%, and 7.4%-14.7%, respectively, revealing that fluorescent DOM occurred mainly in the LMW fraction in the Jiulong River Estuary. The Cl and C2 components in the retentate and permeate samples showed conservative mixing behavior, but the intensity ratio of C2/C1 was higher in the retentate than in the permeate fractions for all salinity samples, showing that the humic component was more enriched in the COM than the fulvic component. The intensity ratio of C3/(C1+C2) was much higher in the retentate than in the permeate fraction for mid-salinity and seawater samples, revealing that the protein-like component was relatively more enriched in COM than the humic-like component. The contribution of the protein-like component (C3) to the total fluorescence in the retentate increased from 14% in the freshwater endmember to 72% for the seawater endmember samples, clearly indicating the variation of dominance by the humic-like component compared to the protein-like component during the estuarine mixing process of COM.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				APR	2014	33	4					22	29		10.1007/s13131-014-0451-4						WOS:000333727700003

Interactions between beta blockers and dissolved organic matter (DOM) may mutually alter their environmental behaviors. To assess this potential, propranolol (PRO) was used as a model beta blocker to quantify the complexation with DOM from different sources using the fluorescence quenching titration method. The sources of studied DOM samples were identified by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) combined with fluorescence regional integration analysis. The results show that PRO intrinsic fluorescence was statically quenched by DOM addition. The resulting binding constants (log K (oc)) ranged from 3.90 to 5.20, with the surface-water-filtered DOM samples claiming the lower log K (oc) and HA having the highest log K (oc). Log K (oc) is negatively correlated with the fluorescence index, biological index, and the percent fluorescence response (P (i,n)) of protein-like region (P (I,n)) and the P (i,n) of microbial byproduct-like region (P (II,n)) of DOM EEMs, while it is correlated positively with humification index and the P (i,n) of UVC humic-like region (P (III,n)). These results indicate that DOM samples from allochthonous materials rich in aromatic and humic-like components would strongly bind PRO in aquatic systems, and autochthonous DOM containing high protein-like components would bind PRO more weakly.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2014	21	7					5217	5226		10.1007/s11356-013-2436-9						WOS:000333424900039	24390196

The aim was to explain the correlation with the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM). A dataset from previously published papers was gathered together and subjected to multivariate analyses. Samples were collected from five tree species experiments in Finland. The degradability of DOM was assessed by measuring bacterial and fungal growth in DOM. The chemical properties of DOM were assessed by XAD resin fractionation and molecular weight. Soil microbial activity was assessed as C and N mineralization and microbial biomass. Both low and high molecular weight compounds, as well as hydrophilic neutral compounds, seemed to be relatively easily degradable. In contrast to our presupposition, easily degradable DOM seemed to be less abundant in soil where variables describing microbial activity were higher. Birch soil with higher microbial biomass N seemed to contain less easily degradable DOM than spruce soil. We suggest that DOM collected and characterized at a certain point reflects more the accumulation of refractory compounds following high microbial activity than the easily degradable compounds that microbes would be using when measured.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				APR	2014	377	1-2					169	177		10.1007/s11104-013-1988-2						WOS:000333614600011

The absorption coefficient of CDOM at 325 nm (aCDOM) increased inversely with decreasing sea-surface salinity (SSS), implying that aCDOM can be used as a natural tracer of Changjiang-diluted water (CDW). This aCDOM vs. SSS relationship, however, differed between 2009 and 2010. For mapping the CDW plume, the aCDOM was retrieved from an ocean-color satellite. Values of SSS were also derived from the satellite-retrieved aCDOM using field-based SSS vs. aCDOM relationships. Satellite observations revealed the temporary variable eastward extension of a high aCDOM, low SSS CDW plume in the central East China Sea (ECS) during the summer. The CDW plume during the summer of 2010 extended southeastward from the mouth of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) to almost 26 degrees N. Moreover, the branch of this southeastward CDW plume was seen to extend northeastward to the eastern ECS where the Kuroshio Current flows northeastward along the shelf break. Subsequently, this branch was distributed around southern Kyushu. Satellite observations revealed this unique dispersal of the CDW plume, which illustrates that the aCDOM and SSS from ocean-color satellite data are useful for monitoring the dispersal of this river-water plume.				英治, 佐々木/G-2247-2016													1017-0839					APR	2014	25	2					279	287		10.3319/TAO.2013.10.03.01(Oc)						WOS:000333796400009

Watershed sources sampled were throughfall, litter leachate, soil water, and deep groundwater. DOM data for a 4-year period (2008-2011) included: DOC concentrations and spectrofluorometric indices such as a(254), humification index, protein-like and humic-like DOM. Seasons were defined as-winter (December-February), spring (March-May), summer (June-September) and autumn (October and November). Seasonal differences in DOM were most pronounced for surficial flow paths (e.g., stormflow, litter leachate, throughfall and soil water) but muted or absent for groundwater and baseflow. This was attributed to the loss of DOM by sorption on mineral soil surfaces and/or microbial breakdown. DOM in summer stormflow had higher DOC concentrations and was more humic in character versus DOM in spring and winter runoff. Storm events in early autumn produced a sharp increase in DOC concentrations and % protein-like DOM for stream waters and litter leachate. Elevated DOC concentrations for early spring throughfall were attributed to leaching of organic exudates associated with leaf emergence. Our results underscore that watershed and ecosystem studies need to pay a greater attention to surficial flow paths and runoff sources (including stormflow) for understanding seasonal patterns of DOM. Understanding the influence of phenological episodes such as autumn leaf-fall for DOM is important considering that these transitional events may be especially affected by climate change.																	0168-2563	1573-515X				APR	2014	118	1-3					321	337		10.1007/s10533-013-9934-1						WOS:000333080400021

The first objective of this study is to characterize different organic functional groups for the Water Extractable Organic Carbon (WEOC) fractions of a forest soil as well as their evolution with depth. The second objective is to clarify the influence of these organic functional groups on the migration of the trace elements in WEOC fractions compared to those in the soil solution obtained by lysimeter plates. All experiments have been performed on an acidic forest soil profile (five depths in the first meter) of the experimental spruce parcel in the Stengbach catchment. The Infra-red spectra of the freeze-dried WEOC fractions show a modification of the molecular structure with depth, i.e. a decrease of the polar compounds such as polysaccharides and an increase of the less polar hydro-carbon functional groups with a maximum value of the aromaticity at 30 cm depth. A Hierarchical Ascending Classification (HAC) of the evolution of Water Extractable Chemical Elements (WECE) with the evolution of the organic functional groups in the organic matter (OM) enriched soil compartments permits recognition of relationships between trace element behavior and the organic functional group variations. More specifically, Pb is preferentially bound to the carboxylic acid function of DOC mainly present in the upper soil compartment and rare earth elements (REE) show similar behavior to Fe, V and Cr with a good affinity to carboxy-phenolic and phenolic groups of DOC. The experimental results show that heavy REE compared to light REE are preferentially bound to the aromatic functional group. This different behavior fractionates the REE pattern of soil solutions at 30 cm depth due to the here observed aromaticity enrichment of DOC. These different affinities for the organic functional groups of the DOC explain some aspects of the behavior of trace elements in soil solutions and in the soil profile but, also the competition between trace elements in complexation with DOC. The results of this study are important for the understanding of the mobility and the migration of pollutants (as heavy metals or radionuclides) as well as nutrients in natural ecosystems.

Controls of dissolved organic matter quality: evidence from a large-scale boreal lake survey	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Inland waters transport large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial environments to the oceans, but DOM also reacts en route, with substantial water column losses by mineralization and sedimentation. For DOM transformations along the aquatic continuum, lakes play an important role as they retain waters in the landscape allowing for more time to alter DOM. We know DOM losses are significant at the global scale, yet little is known about how the reactivity of DOM varies across landscapes and climates. DOM reactivity is inherently linked to its chemical composition. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to explore DOM quality from 560 lakes distributed across Sweden and encompassed a wide climatic gradient typical of the boreal ecozone. Six fluorescence components were identified using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The intensity and relative abundance of these components were analyzed in relation to lake chemistry, catchment, and climate characteristics. Land cover, particularly the percentage of water in the catchment, was a primary factor explaining variability in PARAFAC components. Likewise, lake water retention time influenced DOM quality. These results suggest that processes occurring in upstream water bodies, in addition to the lake itself, have a dominant influence on DOM quality. PARAFAC components with longer emission wavelengths, or red-shifted components, were most reactive. In contrast, protein-like components were most persistent within lakes. Generalized characteristics of PARAFAC components based on emission wavelength could ease future interpretation of fluorescence spectra. An important secondary influence on DOM quality was mean annual temperature, which ranged between -6.2 and +7.5 degrees C. These results suggest that DOM reactivity depends more heavily on the duration of time taken to pass through the landscape, rather than temperature. Projected increases in runoff in the boreal region may force lake DOM toward a higher overall amount and proportion of humic-like substances.

J	Wang, L; Chu, HQ; Dong, BZ				Wang, Lin; Chu, Huaqiang; Dong, Bingzhi			Effects on the purification of tannic acid and natural dissolved organic matter by forward osmosis membrane	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE												The purification performance of tannic acid and dissolved organic matter (DOM) contained real surface water by forward osmosis (FO) was investigated systematically. Since representing the main characteristics of natural DOM fractions, tannic acid was first used as a surrogate for natural DOM analysis. The FO could reject tannic acid effectively with removal efficiencies of approximately 99.0%, as well as for natural DOM removal. The more severe fouling flux decline accompanied with lower tannic acid retention was found at greater draw solution concentrations and in the active-layer-facing-the-draw-solution (AL-facing-DS) orientation, which was ascribed mainly to the more severe fouling resulting from greater tannic acid adsorption in the porous support layer of the FO membrane under these conditions. In the AL-facing-DS mode, iL was revealed that the higher the concentrations of initial substances (i.e., tannic acid and calcium ion) in the feed water, the more notable fouling flux decline and tannic acid retention occurred. In natural DOM purification experiments, the main factors investigated had the similar influences on FO performance as those mentioned above. Further, the membrane orientation has a minor impact on the natural DOM removal by FO membrane. The permeation drag influenced by the water flux probably played a critical role in the retention of tannic acid and natural DOM contained surface water by the FO membrane in AL-facing-DS mode.

Closely related phytoplankton species produce similar suites of dissolved organic matter	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by marine phytoplankton supplies the majority of organic substrate consumed by heterotrophic bacterioplankton in the sea. This production and subsequent consumption converts a vast quantity of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus between organic and inorganic forms, directly impacting global cycles of these biologically important elements. Details regarding the chemical composition of DOM produced by marine phytoplankton are sparse, and while often assumed, it is not currently known if phylogenetically distinct groups of marine phytoplankton release characteristic suites of DOM. To investigate the relationship between specific phytoplankton groups and the DOM they release, hydrophobic phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOMp) from eight axenic strains was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Identification of DOM features derived from Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Thalassiosira, and Phaeodactylum revealed DOMp to be complex and highly strain dependent. Connections between DOMp features and the phylogenetic relatedness of these strains were identified on multiple levels of phylogenetic distance, suggesting that marine phytoplankton produce DOM that in part reflects its phylogenetic origin. Chemical information regarding the size and polarity ranges of features from defined biological sources was also obtained. Our findings reveal DOMp composition to be partially conserved among related phytoplankton species, and implicate marine DOM as a potential factor influencing microbial diversity in the sea by acting as a link between autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial community structures.

J	Osterholz, H; Dittmar, T; Niggemann, J				Osterholz, Helena; Dittmar, Thorsten; Niggemann, Jutta			Molecular evidence for rapid dissolved organic matter turnover in Arctic fjords	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean comprises one of the largest active carbon pools on earth. Deep water formation at high latitudes carries DOM from the active surface layers to the deep ocean. However, information on sources and fate of DOM in the Arctic Ocean is limited. To reveal the relevance of autochthonous DOM production and transformation in Arctic fjord systems to the global deep ocean DOM pool, we performed a comprehensive study on the molecular composition of DOM and the composition of the associated microbial communities in four selected fjords of Svalbard. At various water depths, a total of 34 samples were taken in fall 2010 for the determination of bulk concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), for the molecular characterization of solid-phase extractable DOM as well as for microbial community fingerprinting. While TON concentration and the composition of the microbial community showed a clear distinction between surface and bottom water samples, bulk DOC (similar to 60 mu mol C L-1) and dissolved black carbon (similar to 1.8% of DOC) as a marker for terrestrial input were uniformly distributed. In-depth molecular-level analyses of the DOM composition using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry via Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) revealed insignificant variation of the relative abundance of 11630 molecular masses that were detected in the water samples. From these findings we conclude that DOM produced during the spring/summer bloom is rapidly transformed within the short, but productive warm season by the specialized resident microbial community. Thus, in fall the DOM pool mainly consists of semi-refractory and refractory material, most of which has been introduced from Arctic Ocean water inflow. Assuming that our findings are representative for high latitude marine systems in general, the contribution of autochthonous seasonal DOC production in plankton bloom situations to the DOC pool in regions of deep water formation might be marginal.

Dissolved Organic Matter Kinetically Controls Mercury Bioavailability to Bacteria	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Predicting the bioavailability of inorganic mercury (Hg) to bacteria that produce the potent bioaccumulative neurotoxin monomethylmercury remains one of the greatest challenges in predicting the environmental fate and transport of Hg. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects mercury methylation due to its influence on cell physiology (as a potential nutrient) and its influence on Hg-II speciation in solution (as a complexing agent), therefore controlling Hg bioavailability. We assessed the role of DOM on Hg-II bioavailability to a gram-negative bacterium bioreporter under oxic pseudo- and nonequilibrium conditions, using defined media and field samples spanning a wide range of DOM levels. Our results showed that Hg-II was considerably more bioavailable under nonequilibrium conditions than when DOM was absent or when Hg-II and DOM had reached pseudoequilibrium (24 h) prior to cell exposure. Under these enhanced uptake conditions, Hg-II bioavailability followed a bell shaped curve as DOM concentrations increased, both for defined media and natural water samples, consistent with bioaccumulation results in a companion paper (this issue) observed for amphipods. Experiments also suggest that DOM may not only provide shuttle molecules facilitating Hg uptake, but also alter cell wall properties to facilitate the first steps toward Hg-II internalization. We propose the existence of a short-lived yet critical time window (<24 h) during which DOM facilitates the entry of newly deposited Hg-II into aquatic food webs, suggesting that the bulk of mercury incorporation in aquatic food webs would occur within hours following its deposition from the atmosphere.

Comparative Examination of Effects of Binding of Different Metals on Chromophores of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study quantified the binding of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from Suwannee River with nine metals, Ca(II), Mg(II), Fe(III), Al(III), Cu(II), Cd(II), Cr(III), Eu(III), and Th(IV), using a differential absorbance approach. The differential spectra of DOM were closely fitted with six Gaussian bands that were present for all of the metals at varying pH values. Their maxima were located at ca. 200, 240, 276, 316, 385, and 547 nm (denoted as A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5, respectively). The relative contributions and signs of the Gaussian bands were metal-specific and correlated to some degree with the covalent-bonding index of the ions and applicable complexation constants of the NICA-Donnan model. The intensity of band A4 was linearly proportional to the concentration of DOM-complexed metal, although these correlations formed two groups with different slopes, reflecting the nature of DOM metal interactions. The results demonstrate that differential spectra yield results indicative of the nature and extent of metal and DOM interactions.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 18	2014	48	6					3177	3185		10.1021/es4045314						WOS:000333776000013	24548240

In this study, the electron transfer capability (ETC) of compost-derived DOM was investigated through electrochemical approaches, and the factors influencing the ETC were studied using spectral and elemental analysis. The results showed that the electron accepting capacity (EAC) and electron donating capacity (EDC) of compost-derived DOM were 3.29-40.14 mu mol(e-) (g C)(-1) and 57.1- 346.07 mu mol(e-) (g C)(-1), respectively. Composting treatment increased the fulvic- and humic-like substance content, oxy-genated aliphatic carbon content, lignin-derived aromatic carbon content, molecule weight, and N and S content of DOM, but decreased the aliphatic carbon content and the C and H content.

Meanwhile, fluorescence excitation emission-matrix combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) was also applied. Compared with chromatography fluorescence fingerprints, the EEM-PARAFAC model could not reflect the variety of DOM species with similar fluorescence but different physicochemical properties. The chromatography results showed that the protein-like species were variable among different municipal wastewater treatment plants, some of which are in combination with humic-like species; while there were two major humic-like species fractionated by hydrophilicity and molecular weight (MW), which are also the major contributors to UV absorbance at 254 nm. It was also identified that the relatively hydrophilic humic fractions were slightly larger than the relatively hydrophobic humic fractions. In all the investigated wastewater treatment plants, the relatively hydrophilic and larger MW humic fraction mainly contributed to the fluorescence intensity of humic-like EEM-PARAFAC components. As well as facilitating interpretations of EEM-PARAFAC components, the HPLC/HPSEC fluorescence fingerprints also contributed to a better understanding of fluorescent DOM species in municipal wastewater.

J	Yin, YG; Yu, SJ; Liu, JF; Jiang, GB				Yin, Yongguang; Yu, Sujuan; Liu, Jingfu; Jiang, Guibin			Thermal and Photoinduced Reduction of Ionic Au(III) to Elemental Au Nanoparticles by Dissolved Organic Matter in Water: Possible Source of Naturally Occurring Au Nanoparticles	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Naturally occurring Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been widely observed in ore deposits, coal, soil, and environmental water. Identifying the source of these naturally occurring AuNPs could be helpful for not only the discovery of Au deposits through advanced exploration methods, but also the elucidation of the biogeochemical cycle and environmental toxicity of ionic Au and engineered AuNPs. Here, we investigated the effect of natural/simulated sunlight and heating on the reduction of ionic Au by ubiquitous dissolved organic matter (DOM) in river water. The reductive process probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that phenolic, alcoholic, and aldehyde groups in DOM act as reductive sites. Long-time exposure with thermal and photoirradiation induced the further fusion and growth of AuNPs to branched Au nanostructure as precipitation. The formation processes and kinetics of AuNPs were Further investigated using humic acid (HA) as the DOM model, with comprehensive characterizing methods. We have observed that HA can reduce ionic Au(III) complex (as chloride or hydroxyl complex) to elemental Au nanoparticles under sunlight or heating. In this process, nearly all of the Au(III) could be reduced to AuNPs, in which HA serves as not only the reductive agent, but also the coating agent to stabilize and disperse AuNPs. The size and stability of AuNPs were highly dependent on the concentration ratio of Au(III) to HA. These results imply that, besides biological processes, this thermal or photochemical reduction process is another possible source of naturally occurring AuNPs in natural environments, which possibly has critical impacts on the transport and transformation of Au and engineered AuNPs.

Absorption and fluorescence of dissolved organic matter in the waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Bay, and the Labrador Sea	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated for the first time in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), Baffin Bay (BB), and Labrador Sea (LS) as part of the International Polar Year Canada's Three Oceans project (C3O). The dynamics and composition of absorbing DOM (i.e., colored DOM, or CDOM) and fluorescent DOM (FDOM) were evaluated in several distinct water masses occupying the three regions: surface waters, Arctic outflow waters, West Greenland Intermediate waters (WGIW), upper Labrador Sea waters (uLSW), and Bottom Baffin Deep Water (BBDW). Four fluorescent components were identified by applying parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to 522 excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra: three humic-like and one protein-like. The FDOM in surface waters of the CAA and BB differed considerably in character from those of the LS, with higher fluorescence intensity in the former. The fluorescence intensities of the two terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C3) were linearly correlated with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) in the CAA Arctic outflow and the WGIW whereas only humic-like C3 was significantly correlated with AOU in uLSW. These findings suggest that the humic-like components were produced in situ as organic matter was bio-oxidized. The slopes of the linear relationship between humic-like intensity and AOU were significantly greater in the WGIW relative to the Arctic outflow waters, which implies that FDOM in the Arctic-derived deeper layer was less prone to mineralization.

While methods for sample processing and PARAFAC analysis are well defined and robust, subsequent classification of DOM fluorescence components and comparisons of components among studies remain highly qualitative. Because these comparisons often guide the interpretation of subsequent data, it is important that quantitatively accurate comparisons be made. We developed a statistical tool, comPARAFAC, using a modified Tucker's Congruence Coefficient (mTCC), an established method of factor comparison, to provide a quantitative basis for comparing models. To develop and test this tool we used mTCC to compare factors from 35 DOM fluorescence studies using Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) in marine and freshwater environments. We compared mTCC-guided component matching with qualitative comparisons made in the literature to describe the current perceptions of component equivalence. Based on our analysis, 21% of the direct comparisons made using the qualitative approach are potentially erroneous, whereas possible matches are missed 14% of the time using that same approach. The procedure and accompanying PARAFAC model library for performing quantitative mTCC-guided comparisons are available as an R package (see Web Appendix A). This method simplifies and standardizes the process by which researchers identify and compare fluorescent DOM components across studies.

And parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used for the spectra analyzing to know the main factor and relative contribution of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). PARAFAC decomposed CDOM into four components, the humic-like: C1(240, 415), C3(265, 525), C4(255, 505) and the protein-like: C2(230/280, 330). The fluorescence intensity of CDOM components was high in north and estuary of the lake, but low in the other region. All the four components show significant positive correlations (p<0. 01), this result means they may have the same sources. Principal component analysis shows that these four components of the Tien Lake are all from terrestrial organic matter, meanwhile its DTN, DTP, DON may also come with the terrestrial substance. These components of Tien Lake can well be connected with dissolved nutrient salts by nonlinear multiple regression, which means we can use the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum results of CDOM to indicate the eutrophication degree of Tien Lake.																	1000-0593					MAR	2014	34	3					698	703		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)03-0698-06						WOS:000335624300028

The results suggest that ultrasound treatment can significantly increase COD [chemical oxygen demand], proteins and reducing sugars, but decrease that of lipids in food waste supernatant. Ultrasound pre-treatment boosted the production of VFAs dramatically during the fermentation of food waste. At an ultrasonic energy density of 480 W/L, we treated two kinds of food waste (total solids (TS): 40 and 100 g/L, respectively) with ultrasound for 15 min. The amount of COD dissolved from the waste increased by 1.6-1.7-fold, proteins increased by 3.8-4.3-fold, and reducing sugars increased by 4.4-3.6-fold, whereas the lipid content decreased from 2 to 0.1 g/L. Additionally, a higher VFA yield was observed following ultrasonic pretreatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of the permafrost boundary on dissolved organic matter characteristics in rivers within the Boreal and Taiga plains of western Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Catchment export of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its downstream degradation in aquatic ecosystems are important components of landscape scale carbon balances. In order to assess the influence of peatland permafrost on river DOM characteristics, we sampled 65 rivers along a 900 km transect crossing into the southern discontinuous permafrost zone on the Boreal and Tundra Plains of western Canada. Catchment peatland cover and catchment location north or south of the permafrost boundary were found together to have strong influences on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM chemical composition. River DOC concentrations increased with catchment peatland cover, but were consistently lower for catchments north of the permafrost boundary. In contrast, protein fluorescence (PARAFAC analysis), was unrelated to catchment peatland cover but increased significantly in rivers north of the permafrost boundary. Humic and fulvic acid contribution to DOM fluorescence was lower in rivers draining catchments with large lakes than in other rivers, consistent with extensive photodegradation, but humic and fulvic acid fluorescence were also lower in rivers north of the permafrost boundary than in rivers to the south. We hypothesize that shifts in river DOM characteristics when crossing the permafrost boundary are related to the influence of permafrost on peatland hydrological connectivity to stream networks, peatland DOM characteristics and differences in DOM degradation within aquatic ecosystems.

A tidal study was performed to assess the impacts of tidal pumping on DOM transport. DOM in the estuaries showed non-conservative mixing indicative of mangrove-derived inputs. Similarly, fluorescence data suggest that some terrestrial humic-like components showed non-conservative behavior. An Everglades freshwater-derived fluorescent component, which is associated with soil inputs from the Northern Everglades, behaved conservatively. During the dry season, a protein-like component behaved conservatively until the mid-salinity range when non-conservative behavior due to degradation and/or loss was observed. The tidal study data suggests mangrove porewater inputs to the rivers following low tide. The differences in quantity of DOM exported by the Shark and Harney Rivers imply that geomorphology and tidal hydrology may be a dominant factor controlling the amount of DOM exported from the mangrove ecotone, where up to 21 % of the DOC is mangrove-derived. Additionally, nutrient concentrations and other temporal factors may control DOM export from the mangroves, particularly for the microbially derived fluorescent components, contributing to the seasonal differences. The wet and dry season fluxes of mangrove DOM from the Shark River is estimated as 0.27 x 10(9) mg C d(-1) and 0.075 x 10(9) mg C d(-1), respectively, and the Harney River is estimated as 1.9 x 10(9) mg C d(-1) and 0.20 x 10(9) mg C d(-1).

Soil structural indices' dependence on irrigation water quality and their association with chromophoric components in dissolved organic matter	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW) may affect soil structure and stability and the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of the soil solution. The objectives of our study were (i) to evaluate the impact of TWW irrigation, as compared with fresh water (FW) irrigation, on aggregate stability and saturated hydraulic conductivity (indices of soil structure stability) and (ii) to determine whether these indices can be associated with the chromophoric indicators of water-extractable DOM in TWW- and FW-irrigated soils. We studied aggregate stability and soil hydraulic conductivity (HC) of four different soil types irrigated with either TWW (for at least 5 years) or FW. The results were linked to earlier published data on the concentration scores of fluorescent chromophoric DOM components (obtained from excitation-emission matrices of flouorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and absorbance at 254 nm (Abs254). These were all obtained from water extracts of the same soils as those used in the current study. Irrigation with TWW decreased aggregate stability, in comparison to irrigation with FW, in the sandy clay and clay soils, while in the loamy sand TWW increased aggregate stability. The apparent steady state HCs in the TWW-irrigated samples in the loamy sand, sandy clay and clay soils were similar to, or significantly less than, those obtained in the FW-irrigated samples. In the sandy loam the opposite trend was noted. Results of principal component and classification analyses showed that the aggregate stability indices were directly associated with soil organic matter and DOM attributes in the coarse-textured soils, while in the fine-textured soils inverse associations were noted. Only in the fine-textured soils were the HC attributes associated (directly) with some of the DOM characteristics. Our results suggest that structural indices of fine-textured soils are more sensitive than those of coarse-textured soils to the composition of water extractable DOM.																	1351-0754	1365-2389				MAR	2014	65	2					197	205		10.1111/ejss.12116						WOS:000332517900001

Makino involved in Cd tolerance and accumulation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Phytostabilization has great practical significance and flexibility in the ecological restoration of mining tailings and remediation of heavy metals polluted soils. However, potential use of metallophytes in phytostabilization is limited by a lack of knowledge of many basic plant processes. A mining ecotype (ME) Athyrium wardii, Pb/Cd phytostabilizer, and a non-mining ecotype (NME) A. wardii were grown in a pot experiment to investigate the chemical characteristics of the rhizosphere when exposed to the Cd polluted soils. Rhizobags were used to collect rhizosphere and bulk soils, separately. The results indicated that the ME A. wardii was more efficient in Cd accumulation in the root than NME after growing in Cd polluted soils for 50 days in a green house. Soil solution pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the rhizosphere of ME A. wardii were higher than in the bulk soil and initial values (before planting), whereas the increment in the ME A. wardii were greater than NME. Owing to the increasing of rhizosphere soil pH, exchangeable Cd significantly decreased, whereas the other Cd species were increased with increasing soil DOC values. It is assumed that the ME A. wardii was effective in stabilizing Cd from the mobile fraction to non-mobile fractions. Results from this study suggest that rhizosphere alkalinization and the exudation of high amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to reduce heavy metal mobility might be the two important mechanisms involved in the metal tolerance/accumulation of ME A. wardii.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2014	21	6					4605	4613		10.1007/s11356-013-2421-3						WOS:000332795700053	24338108

The impact of climate change on the treatability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in upland water supplies: A UK perspective	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate change in the UK is expected to cause increases in temperatures, altered precipitation patterns and more frequent and extreme weather events. In this review we discuss climate effects on dissolved organic matter (DOM), how altered DOM and water physico-chemical properties will affect treatment processes and assess the utility of techniques used to remove DOM and monitor water quality. A critical analysis of the literature has been undertaken with a focus on catchment drivers of DOM character, removal of DOM via coagulation and the formation of disinfectant by-products (DBPs). We suggest that: (1) upland catchments recovering from acidification will continue to produce more DOM with a greater hydrophobic fraction as solubility controls decrease; (2) greater seasonality in DOM export is likely in future due to altered precipitation patterns; (3) changes in species diversity and water properties could encourage algal blooms; and (4) that land management and vegetative changes may have significant effects on DOM export and treatability but require further research. Increases in DBPs may occur where catchments have high influence from peatlands or where algal blooms become an issue. To increase resilience to variable DOM quantity and character we suggest that one or more of the following steps are undertaken at the treatment works: a) 'enhanced coagulation' optimised for DOM removal; b) switching from aluminium to ferric coagulants and/or incorporating coagulant aids; c) use of magnetic ionexchange (MIEX) pre-coagulation; and d) activated carbon filtration post-coagulation. Fluorescence and UV absorbance techniques are highlighted as potential methods for low-cost, rapid on-line process optimisation to improve DOM removal and minimise DBPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lonborg, C; Alvarez-Salgado, XA				Lonborg, Christian; Anton Alvarez-Salgado, Xose			Tracing dissolved organic matter cycling in the eastern boundary of the temperate North Atlantic using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption spectra, and CDOM fluorescence characteristic of aromatic amino acids (excitation/emission 280 nm/320 nm; F(280/320)) and marine-humic like substances (320 nm/410 nm; F(320/410)) were measured in full depth during a cruise in the temperate Eastern North Atlantic (ENA). An optimum multi-parameter (OMP) inverse method was run to calculate water mass proportion-weighted average (archetypal) concentrations of these chemical parameters for all water masses and samples. Archetypal concentrations retain the variability due to water mass mixing and basin scale mineralization from the water mass formation sites to the study area. Conversely, the difference between measured and archetypal concentrations, retain the variability due to dissimilarities in mineralization processes within the study area. Our analysis indicates that DOC supported 26 +/- 3% of the AOU in the dark temperate ENA and that basin scale processes occurring at and from the formation area of the water masses explained 63% of the total DOC variability. Our data also suggests that DOC remineralized at the basin scale was of lower molecular weight, and with a lower proportion of fluorescent aromatic amino acids than found within the study area. The relationship between the absorption coefficient at 254 nm (alpha(CDOM)(254)) and AOU indicates that alpha(CDOM)(254) was consumed during organic matter remineralization in the dark ocean, with 55% of the variability being explained by basin scale processes. The relationships of F(320/410) with AOU and DOC confirmed that marine humic-like substances are produced by microbial degradation processes, at a rate of 6.1 +/- 0.9 x 10(-3) mg equivalents of QS mol AOU(-1). Our results also indicate that basin-scale remineralization processes account for 85% of the total variability of F(320/410), emphasizing that large scale processes control the formation of humic-like substance in the dark ENA.

Here, a series of samples were collected from across the Yangtze Estuary to investigate the source and spatial dynamics of CDOM and its components throughout the system. Three indices (a(355), spectral slope, and fluorescence) were then calculated and interpreted. The results indicated that the distribution of CDOM was dominated by allochthonous input, conservative mixing, and phase transfer. The contribution of biogenic CDOM to total CDOM increased with salinity, and three individual CDOM components were identified upon fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis of the water samples: C1, corresponding to humic substance-like CDOM, C2, corresponding to tryptophan-like CDOM, and C3, corresponding to tyrosine-like CDOM. C1 primarily originated from a terrestrial source, C2 had widespread origins, none of which played a dominant role, and C3 mainly originated from allochthonous input in the medium salinity area. Unexpectedly, no marine humic-like component was found in the surface water of the Yangtze Estuary, possibly because turbidity decreased the depth of sunlight penetration, limiting production of this component.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2014	21	5					3460	3473		10.1007/s11356-013-2287-4						WOS:000331823000024	24243263

HJC-D1, was applied for the biodegradation of cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, and the isolation and characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions in antialgal products were studied. Results showed the the growth of M. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited by the cell-free filtrate of Streptomyces sp. HJC-D1 with the growth inhibition of 86 +/- 7 %. The antialgal products were divided using resin adsorbents into the hydrophilic fraction (HPI), hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), transphilic acid (TPI-A), hydrophobic neutral and transphilic neutral, and then the five fractions were analyzed by the 3-D fluorescence spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that the HPI component was the most abundant DOM fraction in the antialgal products, and its concentration was increased with the increase of cell-free filtrate concentration. The fluorescence peak location and intensity analysis showed that the protein-, fulvic-, and humic-like substances were dominant in the HPI, HPO-A, and TPI-A fractions, and intensities of the relevant fluorescence peaks were stronger in the experimental groups than those of the control groups. It was also found that the number-average molecular weight of DOM fractions ranged from 245 to 1,452 g mol(-1), and thereinto organic acids such as HPO-A and TPI-A exhibited lower molecular weights.

This paper evaluated DOM characteristics at hourly resolution. A comparison was made between canal and nearby urban river fluorescence spectra, to emphasise the specific nature of canal water DOM. Results showed that canal water had a significant proportion of microbially derived DOM, while the urban river had a greater proportion of terrestrially derived fractions. The microbial character of canal water DOM originated from the low flow of water, the nutrients predominance and continuous DOM processing. Hence, DOM fluorescence is invariant over a timescale of days, and recreational navigation and precipitation events have no major influence on DOM characteristics. Our results are expected to be applicable to future research on highly regulated freshwater systems for DOM quantity estimation or for water quality models.

Half-hourly geochemical/isotopic records over a 13.5h period from a 20km(2) tropical rainforest headwater in Guyana show an order of magnitude increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in less than 30 mins (10.6-114mg/L). The composition of DOC varies significantly and includes optically invisible dissolved organic matter (iDOM) that accounts for a large proportion (4-89%) of the total DOC, quantified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC suggests that iDOM is comprised of low molecular weight organic moieties, which are likely sourced from fresh leaf litter and/or topsoil, as shown in soils from the surrounding environment. Although poorly constrained at present, the presence of iDOM further downstream during the wet season suggests that this organic matter fraction may represent an unquantified source of riverine CO2 outgassing in tropical headwaters, requiring further consideration.

Increasing DOM concentration from 3 to 300 mg C L-1 enhanced Cr(VI) reduction from 20% to 100% and As(III) oxidation from 6.2% to 25%; however, Cr(VI) reduction decreased from 80-86% to negligible while As(III) oxidation increased from negligible to 18-19% with increasing pH from 2 to 10. Electron spin resonance study suggested semiquinone radicals in DOM were involved in As(III) oxidation while Fourier transform infrared analysis suggested that carboxylic groups in DOM participated in both Cr(VI) reduction and As(III) oxidation. During Cr(VI) reduction, part of DOM (similar to 10%) was oxidized to CO2. The enhanced conversion of Cr(VI) and As(III) in the ice phase was due to the freeze concentration effect with elevated concentrations of electron donors and electron acceptors in the grain boundary. Though DOM enhanced both Cr(VI) reduction and As(III)oxidation, Cr(VI) reduction coupled with As(III) oxidation occurred in absence of DOM. The role of DOM, Cr(VI) and/or As(III) in Cr and As transformation may provide new insights into their speciation and toxicity in cold regions. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Ferreira, A; Ciotti, AM; Giannini, MFC				Ferreira, Amabile; Ciotti, Aurea Maria; Colo Giannini, Maria Fernanda			Variability in the light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, nonalgal particles, and colored dissolved organic matter in a subtropical bay (Brazil)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study characterized the variability in magnitudes and spectral shapes of the absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, detritus, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a dynamic bay (Santos Bay) in southeastern Brazil in response to the contributions of the main estuarine channel and large tide variations, therefore in different time scales. Two strategies were adopted: (1) monthly year-round sampling in the estuarine channel and Santos Bay and (2) sampling in Santos Bay during spring/neap tides and cold/warm months. Chlorophyll-a concentration and CDOM absorption were higher during warm (wet) months, while the relative contribution of organic and inorganic particles was driven by neap/spring tide cycles. Salinity partially accounted for changes in optical variables, especially for CDOM absorption and total suspended matter (TSM) during cold months and neap tides, respectively. The spectral shapes of detritus and CDOM absorption showed relatively little variability for the entire dataset and were not considered feasible for monitoring purposes. The spectral shape of phytoplankton absorption (index of cell size) varied broadly, with no remarkable dependence on the sampling conditions. Comparison of absorption coefficients measured by the Quantitative Filter Technique (QFT) and Transmittance Reflectance (TR) method showed higher phytoplankton coefficients toward longer visible wavelengths (flatter spectra) and shallower slopes of detritus absorption yielded by the TR method. Our results also suggest that measurements at the near red spectral region result from not only scattering signals but also non-algal particle absorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Determination of dissolved organic matter based on UV-light induced reduction of ionic silver to metallic nanoparticles by humic and fulvic acids	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												We describe a novel solution-based method for the determination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) relying on the formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) via photo-stimulated reduction of silver ions by humic and fulvic acids. The method is based on natural driven formation of nanoscale materials yielding a direct relationship between DOM concentration and AgNPs formation. The aqueous dispersion of the formed AgNPs show strong and uniform UV-Vis absorption bands between 450 and 550 nm irrespectively of DOM nature and properties (i.e. humic or fulvic acids). The ensuing chromatic shift accompanying the appearance of the new absorption bands is easily conceivable by a simple spectrophotometer and the bare eye, holding great promise for the on-site, instrumental-free screening of DOM levels. Under the optimum experimental conditions the determination of DOM was successfully demonstrated to various water samples with high sensitivity (<1.0 mg L-1), satisfactory recoveries (87.5-123.5%) and reproducibility (5.87-6.73%).

Photoproduction. of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution from model compounds for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												To explore whether quinone moieties are important in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photochemistry in natural waters, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and associated optical property changes were measured in aqueous solutions irradiated with a Xenon lamp for CDOM model compounds (dihydroquinone, benzoquinone, anthraquinone, napthoquinone, ubiquinone, humic acid HA, fulvic acid FA). All compounds produced H2O2 with concentrations ranging from 15 to 500 mu M. Production rates were higher for HA vs. FA (132 vs. 0.176 mM h(-1)); values ranged from 6.99 to 0.137 mM h(-1) for quinones. Apparent quantum yields (Theta(app); measure of photochemical production efficiency) were higher for HA vs. FA (0.113 vs. 0.016) and ranged from 0.0018 to 0.083 for quinones. Dihydroquinone, the reduced form of benzoquinone, had a higher production rate and efficiency than its oxidized form. Post-irradiation, quinone compounds had absorption spectra similar to HA and FA and 3D-excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra (EEMs) with fluorescent peaks in regions associated with CDOM.

Bacterial community dynamics and activity in relation to dissolved organic matter availability during sea-ice formation in a mesocosm experiment	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												The structure of sea-ice bacterial communities is frequently different from that in seawater. Bacterial entrainment in sea ice has been studied with traditional microbiological, bacterial abundance, and bacterial production methods. However, the dynamics of the changes in bacterial communities during the transition from open water to frozen sea ice is largely unknown. Given previous evidence that the nutritional status of the parent water may affect bacterial communities during ice formation, bacterial succession was studied in under ice water and sea ice in two series of mesocosms: the first containing seawater from the North Sea and the second containing seawater enriched with algal-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). The composition and dynamics of bacterial communities were investigated with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and cloning alongside bacterial production (thymidine and leucine uptake) and abundance measurements (measured by flow cytometry). Enriched and active sea-ice bacterial communities developed in ice formed in both unenriched and DOM-enriched seawater (0-6 days). gamma-Proteobacteria dominated in the DOM-enriched samples, indicative of their capability for opportunistic growth in sea ice. The bacterial communities in the unenriched waters and ice consisted of the classes Flavobacteria, alpha-and gamma-Proteobacteria, which are frequently found in natural sea ice in polar regions. Furthermore, the results indicate that seawater bacterial communities are able to adapt rapidly to sudden environmental changes when facing considerable physicochemical stress such as the changes in temperature, salinity, nutrient status, and organic matter supply during ice formation.

The dynamic exchange of dissolved organic matter percolating through six diverse soils	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												The movement of dissolved organic matter (DOM) through forest soils is regulated by a suite of physicochemical and biological processes that retain, transform, and release DOM. While sorptive processes are known to limit DOM losses, there are still uncertainties about what regulates DOM composition. This study examined DOM dynamics in waters percolating through ex-situ soil cores from six diverse forest soils to determine if DOM leaching losses reflected dynamic exchange processes between fresh DOM inputs and soil surfaces or the continual stripping of surface-reactive compounds from recent DOM inputs. There was a net desorption of hydrophilic compounds into soil solutions after 10 cm soil depth that coincided with an increase in DOM biodegradability as solutions percolated to depth. There was also a limited net retention of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in surface soils. Taken together, these results support a dynamic exchange model of DOM dynamics where highly sorptive, hydrophobic compounds displace previously sorbed, N-rich hydrophilic compounds from soil surfaces. These soils also demonstrated fairly consistent leaching losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DON despite their variation in texture, hydraulic conductivity, and Fe and Al mineralogy, removing 72-85% of the DOC added by 50 cm depth. The strong sorption capacity of these soils may be one reason for the fairly uniform DOM chemistry leaching from these soil cores. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that five fluorescent peaks, including three humic-like peaks (peaks A, C, and E) and two protein-like peaks (peaks B and D), were identified. Most fluorescent components can be degraded after ODH. Fluorescence-quenching titration showed that the modified Stern-Volmer model can be used to fit the quenching data and calculate conditional stability constants (log K) and the % of fluorophores (f %) between DOM and Cu(II). DOM-Cu(II) complexes had relatively high log K values in the RTK and ATT disposals. After the ODH-treatment process, log K values showed a marked decrease. The f % values of protein-like materials were evidently greater than those of humic-like substances. The results showed the impact of the water treatment on the metal-binding ability of various fractions.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				FEB	2014	66	2					270	276		10.1007/s00244-013-9969-2						WOS:000331546000010	24287702

The Kohonen neural network allowed an easier visualisation and interpretation of the results and helped to define the relationships among them.

Understanding how DOM responds to elevated temperature is important for forecasting soil carbon (C) dynamics under climate warming. Here a 4.5-year field microcosm experiment was carried out to examine temporal DOM concentration dynamics in soil pore-water from six different subtropical wetlands. Results are compared between control (ambient temperature) and warmed (+5 degrees C) treatments. UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to reveal DOM structural complexity at the end of the warming incubation. Elevated temperature resulted in initially (I to 2.5 years) high pore-water DOM concentrations in warmed samples. These effects gradually diminished over longer time periods. Of the spectral indices, specific UV absorbance at 280 nm and humification index were significantly higher, while the signal intensity ratio of the fulvic-like to humic-like fluorescence peak was lower in warmed samples, compared to the control. Fluorescence regional integration analysis further suggested that warming enhanced the contribution of humic-like substances to DOM composition for all tested wetlands. These spectral fingerprints implied a declined fraction of readily available substrates in DOM allocated to microbial utilization in response to 4.5 years of warming. As a negative feedback, decreased DOM biodegradability may have the potential to counteract initial DOM increases and alleviate C loss in water-saturated wetland soils. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Critical analysis of commonly used fluorescence metrics to characterize dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												The use of fluorescence spectroscopy for the analysis and characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has gained widespread interest over the past decade, in part because of its ease of use and ability to provide bulk DOM chemical characteristics. However, the lack of standard approaches for analysis and data evaluation has complicated its use. This study utilized comparative statistics to systematically evaluate commonly used fluorescence metrics for DOM characterization to provide insight into the implications for data analysis and interpretation such as peak picking methods, carbon-normalized metrics and the fluorescence index (Fl). The uncertainty associated with peak picking methods was evaluated, including the reporting of peak intensity and peak position. The linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and dissolved organic carbon (Doc) concentration was found to deviate from linearity at environmentally relevant concentrations and simultaneously across all peak regions. Comparative analysis suggests that the loss of linearity is composition specific and likely due to non-ideal intermolecular interactions of the DOM rather than the inner filter effects. For some DOM sources, Peak A deviated from linearity at optical densities a factor of 2 higher than that of Peak C. For carbon-normalized fluorescence intensities, the error associated with DOC measurements significantly decreases the ability to distinguish compositional differences. An in-depth analysis of Fl determined that the metric is mostly driven by peak emission wavelength and less by emission spectra slope. This study also demonstrates that fluorescence intensity follows property balance principles, but the fluorescence index does not. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The protein sources included cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Most of the components were similar among samples and also similar to pelagic components.

Molecular transformation and degradation of refractory dissolved organic matter in the Atlantic and Southern Ocean	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												More than 90% of the global ocean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is refractory, has an average age of 4000-6000 years and a lifespan from months to millennia. The fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is resistant to degradation is a long-term buffer in the global carbon cycle but its chemical composition, structure, and biochemical formation and degradation mechanisms are still unresolved. We have compiled the most comprehensive molecular dataset of 197 Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analyses from solid-phase extracted marine DOM covering two major oceans, the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and the East Atlantic Ocean (ranging from 50 degrees N to 70 degrees S). Molecular trends and radiocarbon dating of 34 DOM samples (comprising Delta C-14 values from -229 parts per thousand to -495 parts per thousand) were combined to model an integrated degradation rate for bulk DOC resulting in a predicted age of >24 ka for the most persistent DOM fraction. First order kinetic degradation rates for 1557 mass peaks indicate that numerous DOM molecules cycle on timescales much longer than the turnover of the bulk DOC pool (estimated residence times of up to similar to 100 ka) and the range of validity of radiocarbon dating. Changes in elemental composition were determined by assigning molecular formulae to the detected mass peaks. The combination of residence times with molecular information enabled modelling of the average elemental composition of the slowest degrading fraction of the DOM pool. In our dataset, a group of 361 molecular formulae represented the most stable composition in the oceanic environment ("island of stability"). These most persistent compounds encompass only a narrow range of the molecular elemental ratios H/C (average of 1.17 +/- 0.13), and O/C (average of 0.52 +/- 0.10) and molecular masses (360 +/- 28 and 497 +/- 51 Da). In the Weddell Sea DOC concentrations in the surface waters were low (46.3 +/- 3.3 mu M) while the organic radiocarbon was significantly more depleted than that of the East Atlantic, representing average surface water DOM ages of 4920 +/- 180 a. These results are in accordance with a highly degraded DOM in the Weddell Sea surface water as also shown by the molecular degradation index IDEG obtained from FT-ICR MS data. Further, we identified 339 molecular formulae which probably contribute to an increased DOC concentration in the Southern Ocean and potentially reflect an accumulation or enhanced sequestration of refractory DOC in the Weddell Sea. These results will contribute to a better understanding of the persistent nature of marine DOM and its role as an oceanic carbon buffer in a changing climate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in dissolved organic matter fluorescence and disinfection byproduct formation from UV and subsequent chlorination/chloramination	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is being increasingly used to help drinking water utilities meet finished water quality regulations, but its influence on disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors and DBP formation is not completely understood. This study investigated the effect of medium pressure (MP) UV combined with chlorination/chloramination on the fluorescent fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from a United States surface water with median total organic carbon content. Parallel factor analysis was used to understand how UV may alter the capacity of DOM to form DBPs of potential human health concern. The production of chloral hydrate and cyanogen chloride from MP UV followed by chlorine or chloramine, respectively, correlated with a decrease in fluorescence intensity of a protein/tryptophan-like component (R-2 = 0.79-0.99) and a humic-like component (R-2 =0.91-1.00). This suggests that the UV-induced precursors to these compounds originated from DOM with similar characteristics to these components. The fluorescent DOM components identified in this study are similar to reoccurring components that have been previously identified in a range of raw and treated waters, and this work demonstrates the value of using fluorescence analysis of DOM to understand the relationships between DOM source and DBP formation under a range of treatment conditions.

Stormwater Dissolved Organic Matter: Influence of Land Cover and Environmental Factors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a major role in defining biological systems and it influences the fate and transport of many pollutants. Despite the importance of DOM, understanding of how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence its composition and characteristics is limited. This study focuses on DOM exported as stormwater from suburban and urban sources. Runoff was collected before entering surface waters and DOM was characterized using specific ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm (a proxy for aromaticity), molecular weight, polydispersity and the fraction of DOM removed from solution via hydrophobic and H-bonding mechanisms. General linear models (GLMs) incorporating land cover, precipitation, solar radiation and selected aqueous chemical measurements explained variations in DOM properties. Results show (1) molecular characteristics of DOM differ as a function of land cover, (2) DOM produced by forested land is significantly different from other landscapes, particularly urban and suburban areas, and (3) DOM from land cover that contains paved surfaces and sewers is more hydrophobic than from other types of land cover. GLMs incorporating environmental factors and land cover accounted for up to 86% of the variability observed in DOM characteristics. Significant variables (p < 0.05) included solar radiation, water temperature and water conductivity.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 7	2014	48	1					45	53		10.1021/es402664t						WOS:000329548800013	24308690

Gloria			Relationship between the Concentrations of Dissolved Organic Matter and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in a Typical UK Upland Stream	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations of total and freely dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in water collected during four sampling events at five sites from the River Wyre. The sites are typical of streams draining upland organically rich soils in northwest U.K. Freely dissolved PAHs were separated from those associated with DOC using a flocculation method. The sum of concentrations of the total and freely dissolved PAHs analyzed ranged from 2.71 to 18.9 ng/L and 2.61 to 16.8 ng/L, respectively. PAH concentrations and PAH fluxes derived from concentrations and water flow rates generally increased downstream, the trend in the latter being more pronounced. The concentration of individual PAHs containing five or more aromatic rings was found to be strongly correlated to the DOC concentration (p < 0.0001), suggesting common terrestrial sources and hydrological pathways. In contrast, no significant relationships were observed between concentrations of PAHs with four or fewer rings and DOC. Concentrations of PAHs with more than four rings showed similar seasonal variation as DOC concentration (peaking in the late summer), while variation in two or three ring PAHs was out of phase with DOC (peaking in the winter). As the PAH DOC relationship appeared partly dependent on the molecular weight of the PAHs, a linear regression function that included an interaction between this variable and DOC concentration was used to model PAH concentrations over a 2 year period to estimate annual fluxes. The relationship identified between PAR concentrations and DOC should help to enhance interpretation of PAH monitoring data that are currently sparse both spatially and temporally and, thus, enable more robust assessments of the potential risks of these environmental pollutants to sensitive aquatic organisms and human water supplies.

After the determination of the best conditions of extraction, the tool was applied to spiked water to calculate the dissolved organic carbon water distribution coefficient (KDOC) in presence of different mixtures of PAHs and Aldrich humic acid. The use of deuterated naphthalene as internal standard for freely dissolved PAH quantification was shown to provide more accuracy than regular external calibration. For the first time, KDOC values of 18 PAHs were calculated using data from SPME-GC-MS and fluorescence quenching; they were in agreement with the results of previous studies. Competition between PAHs, deuterated PAHs and DOM was demonstrated, pointing out the non-linearity of PAH-DOM interactions and the stronger interactions of light molecular weight PAHs (higher KDOC values) in absence of high molecular weight PAHs.

J	Thornton, DCO				Thornton, Daniel C. O.			Dissolved organic matter (DOM) release by phytoplankton in the contemporary and future ocean	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The partitioning of organic matter (OM) between dissolved and particulate phases is an important factor in determining the fate of organic carbon in the ocean. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) release by phytoplankton is a ubiquitous process, resulting in 2-50% of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis leaving the cell. This loss can be divided into two components: passive leakage by diffusion across the cell membrane and the active exudation of DOM into the surrounding environment. At present there is no method to distinguish whether DOM is released via leakage or exudation. Most explanations for exudation remain hypothetical; as while DOM release has been measured extensively, there has been relatively little work to determine why DOM is released. Further research is needed to determine the composition of the DOM released by phytoplankton and to link composition to phytoplankton physiological status and environmental conditions. For example, the causes and physiology of phytoplankton cell death are poorly understood, though cell death increases membrane permeability and presumably DOM release. Recent work has shown that phytoplankton interactions with bacteria are important in determining both the amount and composition of the DOM released. In response to increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, climate change is creating increasingly stressful conditions for phytoplankton in the surface ocean, including relatively warm water, low pH, low nutrient supply and high light. As ocean physics and chemistry change, it is hypothesized that a greater proportion of primary production will be released directly by phytoplankton into the water as DOM. Changes in the partitioning of primary production between the dissolved and particulate phases will have bottom-up effects on ecosystem structure and function. There is a need for research to determine how these changes affect the fate of organic matter in the ocean, particularly the efficiency of the biological carbon pump.																	0967-0262	1469-4433				JAN 2	2014	49	1					20	46		10.1080/09670262.2013.875596						WOS:000333878900003

Bench-scale evaluation of ferrous iron oxidation kinetics in drinking water: Effect of corrosion control and dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Corrosion control strategies are important for many utilities in maintaining water quality from the water treatment plant to the customers' tap. In drinking water with low alkalinity, water quality can become significantly degraded in iron-based pipes if water utilities are not diligent in maintaining proper corrosion control. This article reports on experiments conducted in bicarbonate buffered (5mg-C/L) synthetic water to determine the effects of corrosion control (pH and phosphate) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the rate constants of the Fe(II) oxidation process. A factorial design approach elucidated that pH (P = 0.007, contribution: 42.5%) and phosphate (P = 0.025, contribution: 22.7%) were the statistically significant factors in the Fe(II) oxidation process at a 95% confidence level. The comprehensive study revealed a significant dependency relationship between the Fe(II) oxidation rate constants (k) and phosphate-to- Fe(II) mole ratio. At pH 6.5, the optimum mole ratio was found to be 0.3 to reduce the k values. Conversely, the k values were observed to increase for the phosphate-to- Fe(II) mole ratio >1. The factorial design approach revealed that chlorine and DOM for the designated dosages did not cause a statistically significant (=0.05, P>0.05)change in rate constants. However, an increment of the chlorine to ferrous iron mole ratio by a factor of approximate to 2.5 resulted in an increase k values by a factor of approximate to 10. This study conclusively demonstrated that the lowest Fe(II) oxidation rate constant was obtained under low pH conditions (pH 6.5), with chlorine doses less than 2.2mg/L and with a phosphate-to-Fe(II)moleratio approximate to 0.3 in the iron water systems.																	1093-4529					JAN 2	2014	49	1					1	9		10.1080/10934529.2013.823803						WOS:000325513800001	24117078

CDOM absorption showed a substantial portion of the total absorption and clearly dominant among most investigation stations. It generally decreased from the northwest to the southeast, which controlled by physical mixing of fresh water and seawater as was indicated by a conservative behaviour of CDOM. CDOM absorption sharply increased during phytoplankton blooms. Similarly, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) also peaked during blooms period. However, DOC exhibited a more complex behavior relative to a simple conservative mixing, possibly attributed to multiple origins of DOC. CDOM absorption and DOC co-varied to some degree, implying a potential way of DOC estimation from CDOM absorption. However, more detailed information such as CDOM and DOC composition and more validation data were required to obtain a stable CDOM - DOC pattern. Lastly, empirical algorithms with limited data were developed to retrieve CDOM absorption. Further validation of the algorithms were needed when they were to be commonly applied.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 92610K	10.1117/12.2069245						WOS:000348837900012

It can be used as evaluation indexes for inland water pollution condition. Remote sensing data used for CDOM inversion has its significant advantages, but the inversion method usually has obvious regional limitations. At present, there is little CDOM studies have been carried out to the waters in north China. Yuqiao Reservoir, which is in northern Tianjin, was chosen as the study area, and CDOM was inverted through empirical method for the first time. The data used in this paper was the spectral reflectance data collected on September 24 and 25, 2013 over the 23 sampling points in Yuqiao Reservoir and CDOM concentrations (which is represented by the absorption coeffiecnet of CDOM at 440nm, a(CDOM)(440)) of each sampling points. Among the 23 sampling points, 16 points were selected randomly as training samples, and the remaining 7 points were for accuracy test. Four ratios, as R-rs(412)/R-rs(551), R-rs(443)/R-rs(551), R-rs(490)/R-rs(551) and R-rs(531)/R-rs(551) were used to carry out linear regression with a(CDOM)(440). At the same time, the linear regression was also taken between the logs base 10 of the four ratios and log(a(CDOM)(440)). Then 8 inversion models were built. The performance of the model based on log(R-rs(490)/R-rs(551)) and log(a(CDOM)(440)) was the best. The correlation coefficient R was 0.65. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.088 and the average relative error (sigma) was 11.9%. It showed that the precision of using the ratio of the Remote sensing reflectance of the blue and green band to build inversion models for Yuqiao Reservoir was good, and the method was worth popularization and utilization.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								92611K	10.1117/12.2068564						WOS:000348837900039

K.; Drikas, Mary			Modification of jar testing protocol combined with mEnCo model predicted dose to predict dissolved organic matter removal for surface water	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												In recent climatic events in Australia, the need for frequent jar testing to determine optimum coagulant and flocculant aid doses became apparent in order to determine optimum treatment efficiencies. The generally applied jar test procedure can be time consuming and this prompted investigations for capacity to test waters more rapidly, for a range of treatment conditions and raw water qualities. The aim of the study reported here was to develop a rapid procedure for determination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance (254 nm/cm) for a range of treatment conditions (coagulant dose and pH). Using a previously established predictive model (mEnCo) for coagulant determination, several coagulant doses were then predicted for application in a modified jar test protocol. Best fitted and predicted data using the exponential decay function compared with data from a 6x jar test procedure were obtained using three doses, 0.5x EnCD, EnCD and a VHD (>= 2x EnCD). It is proposed that this procedure may be used to more rapidly determine treatment efficiency based on the removal of organics compared with traditionally applied jar tests.																	1606-9749						2014	14	3					358	366		10.2166/ws.2013.199						WOS:000344018200002

Molecular characterization of dissolved organic matter in various urban water resources using Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometry	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Molecular-level characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in different urban water resources (river water, groundwater, reclaimed water, and rainwater) was performed by Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS). The mass spectra, which were fingerprints of DOM composition, were clearly different among samples. Based on accurate molecular mass determination, about 300 molecular formulae were identified. Most of the DOM molecules were composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Molecular formulae in river water consisted of CHO mostly and much less N- and S-containing compounds than other water samples. The percentage of CHO molecules was the highest for reclaimed water. The reclaimed water sample was characterized by a few peaks with strong intensities, which were presumed to be linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, their co-products and their biodegradation products based on their molecular formulae. Some of these compounds were also detected from river water, probably indicating the impact of wastewater treatment plants located upstream of the sampling point. Orbitrap FT-MS analysis is a powerful tool to discriminate DOM composition of urban water resources.																	1606-9749						2014	14	4					547	553		10.2166/ws.2014.006						WOS:000344019400005

Molecular insights into the microbial formation of marine dissolved organic matter: recalcitrant or labile?	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The degradation of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important control variable in the global carbon cycle. For our understanding of the kinetics of organic matter cycling in the ocean, it is crucial to achieve a mechanistic and molecular understanding of its transformation processes. A long-term microbial experiment was performed to follow the production of non-labile DOM by marine bacteria. Two different glucose concentrations and dissolved algal exudates were used as substrates. We monitored the bacterial abundance, concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC), nutrients, amino acids and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) for 2 years. The molecular characterization of extracted DOM was performed by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) after 70 days and after similar to 2 years of incubation. Although glucose quickly degraded, a non-labile DOC background (5-9% of the initial DOC) was generated in the glucose incubations. Only 20% of the organic carbon from the algal exudate degraded within the 2 years of incubation. The degradation rates for the non-labile DOC background in the different treatments varied between 1 and 11 mol DOCL-1 year(-1). Transparent exopolymer particles, which are released by microorganisms, were produced during glucose degradation but decreased back to half of the maximum concentration within less than 3 weeks (degradation rate: 25 mu g xanthan gum equivalents L-1 d(-1)) and were below detection in all treatments after 2 years. Additional glucose was added after 2 years to test whether labile substrate can promote the degradation of background DOC (co-metabolism; priming effect). A priming effect was not observed but the glucose addition led to a slight increase of background DOC. The molecular analysis demonstrated that DOM generated during glucose degradation differed appreciably from DOM transformed during the degradation of the algal exudates. Our results led to several conclusions: (i) based on our experimental setup, higher substrate concentration resulted in a higher concentration of non-labile DOC; (ii) TEP, generated by bacteria, degrade rapidly, thus limiting their potential contribution to carbon sequestration; (iii) the molecular signatures of DOM derived from algal exudates and glucose after 70 days of incubation differed strongly from refractory DOM. After 2 years, however, the molecular patterns of DOM in glucose incubations were more similar to deep ocean DOM whereas the degraded exudate was still different.

Structural characterization of dissolved organic matter: a review of current techniques for isolation and analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic systems plays many environmental roles: providing building blocks and energy for aquatic biota, acting as a sunscreen in surface water, and interacting with anthropogenic compounds to affect their ultimate fate in the environment. Such interactions are a function of DOM composition, which is difficult to ascertain due to its heterogeneity and the co-occurring matrix effects in most aquatic samples. This review focuses on current approaches to the chemical structural characterization of DOM, ranging from those applicable to bulk samples and in situ analyses (UV-visible spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectroscopy) through the concentration/isolation of DOM followed by the application of one or more analytical techniques, to the detailed separation and analysis of individual compounds or compound classes. Also provided is a brief overview of the main techniques used to characterize isolated DOM: mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance mass spectrometry (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2014	16	9					2064	2079		10.1039/c4em00062e						WOS:000341016000002	24668418

We collected water from a small agricultural wetland (Ohio), Kawai Nui Marsh (Hawaii), the Everglades (Florida), and Okefenokee Swamp (Georgia) to assess the effect of photobleaching on the photofate of two herbicides, acetochlor and isoproturon. Analyte-spiked water samples were irradiated using a solar simulator and monitored for changes in CDOM light absorbance and dissolved oxygen. Photobleaching did not significantly impact the indirect photolysis rates of either herbicide over 24 hours of irradiation. Surprisingly, the opposite effect was observed with isoproturon, which accelerated DOM photobleaching. This phenomenon was more pronounced in higher-CDOM waters, and we believe that the redox pathway between triplet-state CDOM and isoproturon may be responsible for our observations. By contrast, acetochlor indirect photolysis was dependent on reaction with the hydroxyl radical and did not accelerate photobleaching of wetland water as much as isoproturon. Finally, herbicide indirect photolysis rate constants did not correlate strongly to any one chemical or optical property of the sampled waters.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2014	16	9					2098	2107		10.1039/c4em00138a						WOS:000341016000005	24828085

In most inland waters, the remote determination of CDOM absorption presents a central challenge due to their complex optical conditions. However, identifying the temporal and spatial variability of CDOM is fundamental to the understanding of aquatic biogeochemical dynamics. In the present study, semi-analytical and empirical modeling approaches were used to examine CDOM absorption in four, shallow, inland water bodies using the spectral bands and sensitivities of major satellite observational systems. Of the models examined, an empirical multiband model was found to provide the highest correlation with measured CDOM absorption. The spectral characteristics of the MERIS sensors yielded the best results with respect to the other available satellite sensors. High detrital load was observed to be a major impediment to estimating CDOM absorption, while lakes with elevated phytoplankton biomass did not present similar problems.

Revisiting the disappearance of terrestrial dissolved organic matter in the ocean: a delta C-13 study	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Organic carbon (OC) depleted in C-13 is a widely used tracer for terrestrial organic matter (OM) in aquatic systems. Photochemical reactions can, however, change delta C-13 of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) when chromophoric, aromatic-rich terrestrial OC is selectively mineralized. We assessed the robustness of the delta C-13 signature of DOC (delta C-13(DOC)) as a tracer for terrestrial OM by estimating its change during the photobleaching of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) from 10 large rivers. These rivers cumulatively account for approximately one-third of the world's freshwater discharge to the global ocean. Photobleaching of CDOM by simulated solar radiation was associated with the photochemical mineralization of 16 to 43% of the DOC and, by preferentially removing compounds depleted in C-13, caused a 1 to 2.9 parts per thousand enrichment in delta C-13 in the residual DOC. Such solar-radiation-induced photochemical isotopic shift could bias the calculations of terrestrial OM discharge in coastal oceans towards the marine end-member. Shifts in terrestrial delta C-13(DOC) should be taken into account when constraining the terrestrial end-member in global calculation of terrestrially derived DOM in the world ocean.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2014	11	13					3707	3719		10.5194/bg-11-3707-2014						WOS:000339265800017

Dissolved organic matter cycling in eastern Mediterranean rivers experiencing multiple pressures. The case of the trans-boundary Evros River	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												Despite their high ecological value, transboundary Mediterranean rivers and their coastal wetlands are subject to increasing anthropogenic stressors (intensive agriculture, industrial activities, population density) and are predicted to be particularly vulnerable to future climate change. Improving understanding of elemental cycling in these systems is critical for understanding these ecosystems' functioning and response to future pressures. Here we studied dissolved organic matter (C, N and P) cycling in the Evros/Mapa/Meric River, one of the most heavily polluted and, simultaneously, most ecologically valuable transboundary river systems in the Eastern Mediterranean. Measurements were performed in different seasons over a year (April 2009, July 2009, September 2009, April 2010 and July 2010) and along transects extending more than 70 km from the freshwater end-member to 2-km offshore in the Aegean Sea. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Evros waters (DOC: 119 - 496 mu mol/L) was comparable to that of other large Mediterranean rivers (Rhone, Po). The organic component of N and P showed increased variability and ranged from 0.65 to 56 mu mol/L for DON and from 0.03 to 4.15 mu mol/L for DOP. In the lower parts of the river, where all point and non-point inputs converge, the high inorganic N inputs favored elevated assimilation rates by phytoplankton, and resulted in increased chl-a concentrations (up to 488 mu g/L) and autochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) production under dry conditions and low flushing rates. Moreover, the distribution of carbohydrates revealed a constant background of soil-derived mono-saccharides, and additional contributions of poly-saccharides during phytoplankton bloom events. During the dry season, inorganic nutrients and DOM from upstream sources remained restricted in the lower parts of the river (delta and coastal wetlands), while during high flow conditions upstream DOM was flushed to the sea and organic nitrogen forms became an important component of TDN (at least 40%) in the coastal and shelf waters. The co-existence of terrigenous material with autochthonous production and some anthropogenic contributions is supported by the large variability found in DOC: DON (4 - 96) and DOC: DOP (79 - > 1000) ratios, the positive correlation of DOC vs chl-a (r(2)=0.76, p=0.01 for July 2009; r(2)=0.77 p=0.01 for September 2009), the decoupling between DOC and DON, and the observed spatial distribution of inorganic N forms including ammonium. Our results illustrate the combined and complex influences of (i) seasonally dependent hydrological processes, (ii) consistent upstream anthropogenic pollution sources, and (iii) irregular water resource management practices on C, N, P dynamics along this heavily polluted transboundary river system, its delta and wetland ecosystem, and adjacent Mediterranean coastal waters.				feng, yongzhong/F-5090-2012; Dimitriou, Elias/H-4237-2011	feng, yongzhong/0000-0002-5202-4368; Dimitriou, Elias/0000-0001-6669-6897												1108-393X						2014	15	2					398	415								WOS:000339048900015

Absorption and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter of the eastern Bering Sea in the summer with special reference to the influence of a cold pool	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The absorption and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are reported for the inner shelf, slope waters and outer shelf regions of the eastern Bering Sea during the summer of 2008, when a warm, thermally stratified surface mixed layer lay over a cold pool (< 2 degrees C) that occupied the entire middle shelf. CDOM absorption at 355 nm (a(g)355) and its spectral slope (S) in conjunction with excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed large variability in the characteristics of CDOM in different regions of the Bering Sea. PARAFAC analysis aided in the identification of three humic-like (components one, two and five) and two protein-like (a tyrosine-like component three, and a tryptophan-like component four) components. In the extensive shelf region, average absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(g)355, m(-1)) and DOC concentrations (mu M) were highest in the inner shelf (0.342 +/- 0.11 m(-1), 92.67 +/- 14.60 mu M) and lower in the middle (0.226 +/- 0.05 m(-1), 78.38 +/- 10.64 mu M) and outer (0.185 +/- 0.05 m(-1), 79.24 +/- 18.01 mu M) shelves, respectively. DOC concentrations, however were not significantly different, suggesting CDOM sources and sinks to be uncoupled from DOC. Mean spectral slopes S were elevated in the middle shelf (24.38 +/- 2.25 mu m(-1)) especially in the surface waters (26.87 +/- 2.39 mu m(-1)) indicating high rates of photodegradation in the highly stratified surface mixed layer, which intensified northwards in the northern middle shelf likely contributing to greater light penetration and to phytoplankton blooms at deeper depths. The fluorescent humic-like components one, two, and five were most elevated in the inner shelf most likely from riverine inputs. Along the productive "green belt" in the outer shelf/slope region, absorption and fluorescence properties indicated the presence of fresh and degraded autochthonous DOM. Near the Unimak Pass region of the Aleutian Islands, low DOC and a(g)355 (mean 66.99 +/- 7.94 mu M; 0.182 +/- 0.05 m(-1)) and a high S (mean 25.95 +/- 1.58 mu m(-1)) suggested substantial photobleaching of the Alaska Coastal Water, but high intensities of humic-like and protein-like fluorescence suggested sources of fluorescent DOM from coastal runoff and glacier meltwaters during the summer. The spectral slope S vs. a(g)355 relationship revealed terrestrial and oceanic end members along with intermediate water masses that were modeled using nonlinear regression equations that could allow water mass differentiation based on CDOM optical properties. Spectral slope S was negatively correlated (r(2) = 0.79) with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) for waters extending from the middle shelf into the deep Bering Sea indicating increasing microbial alteration of CDOM with depth. Although our data show that the CDOM photochemical environment of the Bering Sea is complex, our current information on its optical properties will aid in better understanding of the biogeochemical role of CDOM in carbon budgets in relation to the annual sea ice and phytoplankton dynamics, and to improved algorithms of ocean color remote sensing for this region.

Long-term studies on hybrid ceramic microfiltration for treatment of surface water containing high dissolved organic matter	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												This long-term pilot-scale study on the performance of ceramic microfiltration (CMF) was conducted at the Bangkhen water treatment plant (BWTP), with the raw water from Chaophraya River, Thailand. Raw water turbidity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were varied in the ranges of 20-210 NTU and 3.0-8.5 mg/L respectively. The hybrid pilot-scale CMF (Pilot-CMF) operational parameters were optimized with the aid of jar-tests and laboratory-scale CMF (Lab-CMF) operations. The systems were operated with various polyaluminum chloride dosages and filtration cycle times. Pilot-CMF provided excellent steady turbidity removal compared to the conventional water treatment process. DOC removal percentages of Pilot-CMF and the conventional process at the BWTP were 49% and 30% respectively. With different coagulant dosages, unique patterns in transmembrane pressure (TMP) variations were observed. The daily TMP increment under low turbidity conditions was 0.08 kPa/day. During rainy periods (turbidity over 100 NTU) the TMP increment reached 0.79 kPa/day. However, once the turbidity of raw water reaches normal conditions (30-60 NTU at the BWTP) the Pilot-CMF system recovers the TMP increment due to efficient backwashing.																	1606-9749						2014	14	2					246	254		10.2166/ws.2013.194						WOS:000338338400009

This process can enhance the solubility as well as decreased uptake to biota (i.e. less bioavailablility) of HOPs. It has been shown that log KDOm (HOP/DOM partition coefficient) for a particular HOP will vary in different natural waters with different DOM present. Thus, an HOP probe could be used to characterize the differences between aquatic DOM in different natural waters. Perylene appears to be an excellent probe to use as an HOP to characterize the differences between aquatic DOM in different natural waters. The objective of this paper was to consider adding another method to the categorize DOM reactivity related to an environmental concern by measuring sorption to the exemplary HOP probe perylene. This method could be used to determine the potential free hazardous HOP that would be present in any natural water. As an application of this method, the sorption of Perylene to stormwater DOM was assessed. Stormwater runoff samples showed 58 % and 28 % free perylene for one Fall and one Spring stormwater runoff sample, respectively. This indicates that the relationship between DOM and HOPs in equilibrium with DOM-HOPs might need definition on a temporal basis and even different flow regimes to understand the bioavailability of HOPs in stormwater.																	0097-6156		978-0-8412-2951-8				2014	1160						193	205								WOS:000337981900010

The results indicated that DOM significantly facilitated the desorption of Cd from freeze-thaw treated soils when comparing with that of non-frozen soils. Effects of DOM on the Cd desorption were highly dependent on the soil type and contamination concentration. The maximum desorption ratios of Cd by DOM generated from straw and sludge were 15.6% and 13.65%, respectively, in brown soils, and the maximum desorption ratios reached 14.7% and 9.3%, respectively, when using black soils through the same treatment. The higher the Cd contamination concentration in soils, the higher the ratio of Cd desorption by DOM. This was because of the integrated effects of the soil properties changed by the freeze-thaw treatment and the species transformation of Cd. The characteristics of DOM, such as its concentration and properties, had shown obvious impacts on the Cd desorption by DOM. The desorption was promoted with the increased DOM concentration and the hydrophilic fraction, and lowered pH and the low-molecular-weight of DOM.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2014	30	1					76	86		10.1080/02757540.2013.817566						WOS:000337184000007

During the 46-day composting process, six samples with different composting time were collected from Songjiang Solid Waste Biological Treatment Plant in Shanghai, China. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted by ultra-pure water, and the UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectra of DOM were scanned and investigated. The results showed that, during the composting process, non-humus substances in DOM were gradually transformed into humus substances, the aromatization, molecular weight and humification of humus substances increased. Correlation analysis showed that the absorbance value at 280 nm (SUVA(280)), and the area of 226 similar to 400 nm (A(226 similar to 400)) correlated positively with each other. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration exhibited a negative correlation with the parameters S-275 similar to 295, SUVA(280) and A(200-226), and the correlation coefficients between the DOC content and the A(220 similar to 226) value was the best (r= -0.976, P=0.001). The absorbance ratio bewteen 465 and 665 nm (E-465/E-665) showed a significant correlation with SUVA280 (r=-0.892, P=0.017), A(226-400) (r=-0.909, P=0.012) and DOC (r=0.840, P=0.036). The absorbance ratio of 250 to 365 nm (E-250/E-365) correlated significantly with DOC (r=-0.880, P=0.021), and showed no correlation with the other parameters. Absorption curve slope in the range of 275 similar to 295nm (S-275 similar to 295) showed a significantly positive correlation with the DOC content (r=0.961, P=0.002).

Interaction of extrinsic chemical factors affecting photodegradation of dissolved organic matter in aquatic ecosystems	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the carbon cycle. Irradiation experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of chemical factors, specifically those expected to be altered in natural waters by atmospheric acid deposition, on photodegradation of DOM. These included pH, nitrate, iron and calcium. The experiments were carried out using stream and lake water samples with a wide range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Decreasing DOC concentration along with decreasing absorbance was observed during three-week exposures to natural solar radiation as well as during laboratory experiments with artificial solar radiation. The pH of the samples significantly affected degradation rates of DOM especially with elevated iron, while no influence of nitrate or calcium concentration was observed. Addition of Fe-III did not significantly affect photodegradation and photobleaching rate constants in samples at circumneutral pH. Acid pH increased photodegradation rates. The results suggest that photodegradation rates of DOM will decrease during recovery from acidification. Hence, lower photodegradation rates may be responsible for increases in DOM observed in some regions of North America and Europe.

The importance of charge-transfer interactions in determining chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical and photochemical properties	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Absorption of sunlight by chromophoric dissolved natural organic matter (CDOM) is environmentally significant because it controls photic zone depth and causes photochemistry that affects elemental cycling and contaminant fate. Both the optics (absorbance and fluorescence) and photochemistry of CDOM display unusual properties that cannot easily be ascribed to a superposition of individual chromophores. These include (i) broad, unstructured absorbance that decreases monotonically well into the visible and near IR, (ii) fluorescence emission spectra that all fall into a single envelope regardless of the excitation wavelength, and (iii) photobleaching and photochemical quantum yields that decrease monotonically with increasing wavelength. In contrast to a simple superposition model, these phenomena and others can be reasonably well explained by a physical model in which charge-transfer interactions between electron donating and accepting chromophores within the CDOM control the optical and photophysical properties. This review summarizes current understanding of the processes underlying CDOM photophysics and photochemistry as well as their physical basis.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2014	16	4					654	671		10.1039/c3em00573a						WOS:000333565000003	24509887

Robert; Cory, Rose M.; McNeill, Kristopher			Evidence for dissolved organic matter as the primary source and sink of photochemically produced hydroxyl radical in arctic surface waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) is an indiscriminate oxidant that reacts at near-diffusion-controlled rates with organic carbon. Thus, while center dot OH is expected to be an important oxidant of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and other recalcitrant compounds, the role of cOH in the oxidation of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems is not well known due to the poorly constrained sources and sinks of center dot OH, especially in pristine (unpolluted) natural waters. We measured the rates of center dot OH formation and quenching across a range of surface waters in the Arctic varying in concentrations of expected sources and sinks of center dot OH. Photochemical formation of cOH was observed in all waters tested, with rates of formation ranging from 2.6 +/- 0.6 to 900 +/- 100 +/- 10 +/- 12 M s(-1). Steady-state concentrations ranged from 2 +/- 1 to 290 +/- 60 +/- 10 +/- 17 M, and overlapped with previously reported values in surface waters. While iron-mediated photoFenton reactions likely contributed to the observed center dot OH production, several lines of evidence suggest that DOM was the primary source and sink of photochemically produced center dot OH in pristine arctic surface waters. DOM from first-order or headwater streams was more efficient in producing center dot OH than what has previously been reported for DOM, and cOH formation decreased with increasing residence time of DOM in sunlit surface waters. Despite the ubiquitous formation of cOH in arctic surface waters observed in this study, photochemical cOH formation was estimated to contribute # 4% to the observed photooxidation of DOM; however, key uncertainties in this estimate must be addressed before ruling out the role of cOH in the oxidation of DOM in these waters.

Photo-reactivity of natural dissolved organic matter from fresh to marine waters in the Florida Everglades, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the major absorber of sunlight in most natural waters and a critical component of carbon cycling in aquatic systems. The combined effect of light absorbance properties and related photo-production of reactive species are essential in determining the reactivity of DOM. Optical properties and in particular excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) have been used increasingly to track sources and fate of DOM. Here we describe studies conducted in water from two estuarine systems in the Florida Everglades, with a salinity gradient of 2 to 37 and dissolved organic carbon concentrations from 19.3 to 5.74 mg C L-1, aimed at assessing how the quantity and quality of DOM is coupled to the formation rates and steady-state concentrations of reactive species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and the triplet excited state of DOM. These species were related to optical properties and PARAFAC components of the DOM. The formation rate and steady-state concentration of the carbonate radical was calculated in all samples. The data suggests that formation rates, particularly for singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, are strongly coupled to the abundance of terrestrial humic-like substances. A decrease in singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and carbonate radical formation rates and steady-state concentration along the estuarine salinity gradient was observed as the relative concentration of terrestrial humic-like DOM decreased due to mixing with microbial humic-like and protein-like DOM components, while the formation rate of triplet excited-state DOM did not change. Fluorescent DOM was also found to be more tightly coupled to reactive species generation than chromophoric DOM.

Composite soil samples of different depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) were collected from four different wetland ecosystems along a disturbed-impact and land-use gradient in Taihu Lake wetland, i.e. cinnamomum camphora field (CFD), grassland (GLD), paddy field (PFD), and soybean field (SFD). Fifteen humification indices (HIXs) (A(4)/A(1), A(465), I-445/I-340, I-370/I-338, I-440/I-338, I-440/I-370, S338-370, S338-440, S370-440, A(2)/A(1), A(3)/A(1)) A(3)/A(2), C-1, C-2 and C-3), deduced from fluorescence spectra of DOM, were very feasible to indicate humification degree, except A(4)/A(1) and C-2. The aromatic contents and molecular weights of DOM were the highest in the CFD soils, while land-use intensity was the lowest, followed by the GLD, PFD and SFD. Humification degree of DOM within the CFD soil profile was the highest, followed by the GLD, PFD and SFD. Due to good linear correlations of electric conductivity (EC) with HIXs, EC could indirectly suppress humification processes through adverse effect on microbial and biochemical activity. Obviously fluorescence can be used as an effective method to indicate soil DOM humification, and also be used as a predictive tool to indicate secondary salinization.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	4					986	994								WOS:000333884800004

Direct and Indirect Effects of Dissolved Organic Matter Source and Concentration on Denitrification in Northern Florida Rivers	ECOSYSTEMS												Using a natural gradient of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) source and concentration in rivers of northern Florida, we investigated how terrestrially-derived DOC affects denitrification rates in river sediments. Specifically, we examined if the higher concentrations of DOC in blackwater rivers stimulate denitrification, or whether such terrestrially-derived DOC supports lower denitrification rates because (1) it is less labile than DOC from aquatic primary production; whether (2) terrestrial DOC directly inhibits denitrification via biochemical mechanisms; and/or whether (3) terrestrial DOC indirectly inhibits denitrification via reduced light availability to-and thus DOC exudation by-aquatic primary producers. We differentiated among these mechanisms using laboratory denitrification assays that subjected river sediments to factorial amendments of NO3- and dextrose, humic acid dosing, and cross-incubations of sediments and water from different river sources. DOC from terrestrial sources neither depressed nor stimulated denitrification rates, indicating low lability of this DOC but no direct inhibition; humic acid additions similarly did not affect denitrification rates. However, responses to addition of labile C increased with long-term average DOC concentration, which supports the hypothesis that terrestrial DOC indirectly inhibits denitrification via decreased autochthonous production. Observed and future changes in DOC concentration may therefore reduce the ability of inland waterways to remove reactive nitrogen.

Effect of Native Vegetation Loss on Stream Ecosystem Processes: Dissolved Organic Matter Composition and Export in Agricultural Landscapes	ECOSYSTEMS												Stream and river ecosystems are dependent on energetic inputs from their watersheds and thus shifts in land use from forest cover to agriculture will affect stream community composition and function. The disruption of forest-aquatic linkages alters the organic matter resources in agricultural streams. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the dominant form of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems, and a microbial energy source that is important for stream respiration. The concentrations and characteristics of DOM are regulated by both terrestrial (for example, terrestrial organic matter supply) and in-stream processes (for example, microbial respiration and periphyton production) that are influenced by land management. The effects of watershed land use and topographic, soil and climatic variables on DOM quantity (dissolved organic carbon concentration and load), source (terrestrial or in-stream) and quality (composition and lability) were measured in 14 streams across an agricultural land-use gradient. DOC concentration was positively correlated with watershed pasture cover and negatively correlated with watershed relief. No watershed variables were important correlates of DOC load. Stream DOM was primarily of terrestrial origin, but DOM in agricultural streams had a greater proportion of sources from in-stream sources. This may be due to reduced connection with riparian vegetation and increased in-stream primary production. We suggest that maintaining watershed tree cover greater than 52% and ensuring less than 10% of the length of riparian corridor is cleared for pasture could minimize changes to DOM composition. This is important to avoid flow-on effects for stream ecosystem processes that are mediated by DOM. Long-term DOM monitoring will be valuable for assessing the functional impacts of land-use change.

These advanced technologies were applied as pretreatments for soil aquifer treatment (SAT). Soil aquifer treatment alone removed 20 to 30% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254. Soil aquifer treatment effectively removed 100% and 76% of DOM with AMWs of 21.3 to 31.6 kDa and 0.4 to 1.0 kDa, respectively. With pretreatments of ozonation, MIEX resin coagulation and nanofiltration, substantially higher removals (40 to 75%) were achieved for DOC and UV254. The removal efficiency of the entire system decreased as nanofiltration-SAT > ozonation-SAT > MIEX-SAT > ultrafiltration-SAT, which is positively related to the removal efficiency for medium AMW (1.8 to 7.7 kDa, mainly humic substances) DOM during pretreatments. Different pretreatments should, therefore, be chosen in accordance with the water quality of feed water and water products and SAT removal efficiency.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				JAN	2014	86	1					81	86		10.2175/106143013X13807328848856						WOS:000331464300011	24617114

Assessing the multisite binding properties of multiple sources of dissolved organic matter at nanomolar copper concentrations using piecewise linear regression and parallel factor analysis of fluorescence quenching	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												This study reports on the development and application of a piecewise linear model for the determination of copper-binding parameters at concentrations in the nanomolar range using fluorescence quenching. l-Tyrosine, Suwannee River natural organic matter, and two leaf leachates with similar fluorescence signatures were used as test compounds, and results were compared with those of the standard Ryan-Weber model. The piecewise model was also applied to and compared with data from an earlier study. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to identify three to five independent fluorophores in each test compound, and copper-binding parameters were estimated for one to three binding sites for each fluorophore. The binding properties of similar and different fluorophores were also compared. The conditional binding strengths (log K') estimated using the piecewise approach were similar to those obtained using the Ryan-Weber approach (p > 0.05); however, the piecewise linear model provided superior results compared to models based on the Ryan-Weber equation in several ways, including (1) capable of distinguishing more binding sites for a single fluorophore, (2) capable of extracting binding parameters at environmentally relevant, nanomolar concentrations of copper, where fluorescence changes are often observed as enhancement, (3) greater precision over repeated titrations, and (4) no severe underestimation of complexing capacities. Finally, the copper-binding properties of PARAFAC components with similar optical signatures were found to be similar, both in sources with dramatically different and similar total fluorescence signatures.																	1618-2642	1618-2650				JAN	2014	406	3					867	877		10.1007/s00216-013-7529-2						WOS:000329625800021	24327077

Spatiotemporal Variability in Dissolved Organic Matter Composition is More Strongly Related to Bacterioplankton Community Composition than to Metabolic Capability in a Blackwater Estuarine System	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The composition and metabolic capability of bacterioplankton communities were examined over seasonal and spatial gradients and related to the source, composition, and quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the blackwater estuary Winyah Bay, Georgetown County, SC, USA and its tributary rivers. Bacterial community composition (BCC) was measured by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and bacterial metabolic capability (BMC) was measured by defined substrate utilization patterns (Biolog GN2 plates). Spatial patterns were not important, despite the anticipated watershed effects and the well-documented influence of salinity gradients on estuarine bacterioplankton, but DOM, BCC, and BMC all showed varying degrees of temporal patterns; DOM-based groupings differentiated BCC samples better than spatiotemporal categories, but not BMC. BCC was closely related to properties describing DOM composition, particularly those related to DOM source (i.e., cypress swamps vs. in situ phytoplankton production, indicated by chlorophyll a, colored DOM spectral slope, alpha 355/dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and DOC concentration), and to associated physicochemical variables, such as temperature, pH, and salinity. BMC was more strongly related to abiotic factors, such as temperature and dissolved nutrients, as well as to chlorophyll a and percent bioavailable DOC. In contrast with previous studies, BCC and BMC were significantly correlated in this highly heterotrophic estuary, suggesting that DOM source variability may select for specialist phylotypes above a background of generalists. This study, therefore, supports a causative pathway from DOM to BMC to BCC while suggesting that BCC and BMC may be simultaneously influenced by different suites of DOM characteristics and physicochemical parameters.

However, only few studies have focused on groundwater systems, specifically, on karst systems. The aim of this study was to develop the use of the DOM fluorescence signal as a natural tracer, considering the multiple compartments of a karst system. This method was applied to the Lez hydrosystem, which supplies the city of Montpellier with drinking water. The hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry of the spring were monitored beginning March 2006. The DOM fluorescence was measured by the excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy technique. The analysis of the total fluorescence signal confirms the efficiency of this tool to trace rapid infiltration flows. Moreover, the decomposition of the signal into different fluorophores complements the information provided by the total signal. Indeed, the fluorescence emitted by the humic compounds seems to be the ideal tool for identifying rapid infiltration flows. Nevertheless, the fluorescence of protein-like compounds is better correlated with the inflow of faecal bacteria at the outlet. This decomposition of the fluorescence signal is an interesting way to provide information on both the rapid infiltration flow as well as the vulnerability of the karst aquifers.

P. minimum grew equally well in the presence of identical amounts of nitrate, ammonium, and urea. Approximately 18 to 20% of organic N bound to the DOM was bioavailable. Although the available N added in the DOM treatment was only 1/3 of the amount of any other N sources, the cell densities of P. minimum in the DOM treatment increased to 61 similar to 65% of those in the nitrate, ammonium or urea treatment. The maximum specific growth rates did not differ significantly between the treatments with the highest in the ammonium treatment (0.55 +/- 0.13 d(-1)) and the lowest in the urea treatment (0.39 +/- 0.04 d(-1)). P. minimum assimilated the available DOM-bound N in a short period (fewer than 5 days), which was faster than utilizing urea. The increase in the cellular N:P ratios of P. minimum showed the alleviation of N stress in all the treatments after the addition of various N forms. The densities and cellular compositions of P. minimum stabilizing in all the treatments for the whole stationary phase indicated that P. minimum has adaptive physiology under sub-optimal conditions and is a competitive bloom species. We suggest that P. minimum cells utilize DOM-bound N for their growth, and the efficiency in utilizing the available DOM-bound N for growth is comparable to when P. minimum utilizes nitrate, ammonium or urea.

An assessment of remote sensing algorithms for colored dissolved organic matter in complex freshwater environments	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This study evaluated fifteen algorithms representing four major categories of retrieval algorithms for aquatic colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM): empirical, semi-analytical, optimization, and matrix inversion methods. The specific goal here was to evaluate (and understand) the strengths and limits of these algorithms in predicting CDOM dynamics along a gradient of varying water quality in a large, freshwater ecosystem. The data were collected in May and October of 2012 from the estuarine areas of the Kawkawlin and Saginaw Rivers, and Lake Huron. Algorithms were evaluated through comparisons to in-situ CDOM measurements, such that the analysis of these field measurements showed that CDOM levels in these areas displayed a range of CDOM absorption coefficients a(CDOM)(440) (0.1-8.5 m(-1)). In general, the majority of the algorithms underestimated high CDOM waters(a(CDOM)(440)>2 m(-1)) and overestimated low CDOM scenarios (<0.5 m(-1)). Six algorithms that performed consistently better compared with the other models (overall RMSE of <0.45) in estimating in-situ CDOM levels were three empirical, two semi-analytical, and one MIM algorithms. Our analysis identified a set of parameters for the matrix inversion methods (MIM) that allow them to work effectively across a broad range of CDOM levels. Analysis of our results indicated that the most effective wavelengths/band locations for estimating CDOM could vary depending on the levels of spectral interference from high concentrations of particulate matter in the water column. In addition, our results suggest that including wavelengths > 600 nm in the algorithms improves CDOM estimation accuracy significantly, particularly for complex freshwater environments.

This study examines the impact of the quality and quantity of eDOM, supplied as secondary C-source, on the structure, composition and pesticide-degrading activity of a triple-species bacterial consortium in which the members synergistically degrade the phenylurea herbicide linuron, when grown as biofilms. Biofilms developing on 10 mg L-1 linuron showed a steady-state linuron degradation efficiency of approximately 85 %. The three bacterial strains co-localized in the biofilms indicating syntrophic interactions. Subsequent feeding with eDOM or citrate in addition to linuron resulted into changes in linuron-degrading activity. A decrease in linuron-degrading activity was especially recorded in case of co-feeding with citrate and eDOM of high quality and was always associated with accumulation of the primary metabolite 3,4-dichloroaniline. Improvement of linuron degradation was especially observed with more recalcitrant eDOM. Addition of eDOM/citrate formulations altered biofilm architecture and species composition but without loss of any of the strains and of co-localization. Compositional shifts correlated with linuron degradation efficiencies. When the feed was restored to only linuron, the linuron-degrading activity rapidly changed to the level before the mixed-substrate feed. Meanwhile only minor changes in biofilm composition and structure were recorded, indicating that observed eDOM/citrate effects had been primarily due to repression/stimulation of linuron catabolic activity rather than to biofilm characteristics.																	0175-7598	1432-0614				JAN	2014	98	2					931	943		10.1007/s00253-013-4928-4						WOS:000329627600040	23653124

Dissolved organic matter cycling in the confluence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans south of Africa	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The boundary between the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean is a key spot of the thermohaline circulation, where the following water masses mix up: Indian Central water (ICW), South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) and Antarctic Winter Water (WW). An optimum multiparameter analysis based on the distributions of potential temperature, salinity, NO (=O-2+9.3 x NO3) and silicate during the GoodHope 2004 (GH04) cruise allowed us to (i) define the realms of these water masses: (ii) obtain the water mass proportion weighted-average (archetypal) apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of each water mass; and (iii) estimate the contribution of DOC to the oxygen demand of the study area. WW represented only 5.2% of the water volume sampled during GH04, followed by WSDW with 10.8%, NADW with 12.7%, SACW with 15.3%, AAIW with 23.1% and CDW with 32.8%. The distributions of DOC and AOU were mainly explained by the mixing of archetypal concentrations of these variables, 75 +/- 5% and 65 +/- 3% respectively, which retained the variability due to the basin-scale mineralization from the formation area to the barycentre of each water mass along the GH04 line. DOC accounted for 26 +/- 2% and 12 +/- 5% of the oxygen demand of the meso- and bathypelagic ocean, respectively. Conversely, local mineralization processes, retained by the residuals of the archetypal concentrations of DOC and AOU, did not contribute to improve significantly the mixing model of DOC.

They recorded at high vertical (1 m) and temporal (5 day) resolution, the vertical distribution and seasonal variation of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as well as of chlorophyll-a concentration and hydrological variables. The CDOM standing stock presented a clear seasonal dynamics with the progressive summer formation and winter destruction of subsurface CDOM maxima (YSM, for Yellow Substance Maximum). It was argued that subsurface CDOM is a by-product of phytoplankton, based on two main characteristics, (1) the YSM was located at the same depth than the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) and (2) the CDOM increased in summer parallels the decline in chlorophyll-a. These observations suggested an indirect but tight coupling between subsurface CDOM and phytoplankton via microbial activity or planktonic foodweb interactions. Moreover, the surface CDOM variations observed both by floats and MODIS displayed different seasonal dynamics from what recorded at subsurface one. This implies that CDOM standing stock can be hardly detected by satellite. It is worthnoting that surface CDOM was found to be more related to the sea surface temperature (SST) than chlorophyll-a concentration, suggesting its physical origin, in contrast to the biological origin of YSM and subsurface standing stocks.

Predicting nitrogen and acidity effects on long-term dynamics of dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes may relate to changes in sulphur and nitrogen pollution. We integrated existing models of vegetation growth and soil organic matter turnover, acid-base dynamics, and organic matter mobility, to form the 'MADOC' model. After calibrating parameters governing interactions between pH and DOC dissolution using control treatments on two field experiments, MADOC reproduced responses of pH and DOC to additions of acidifying and alkalising solutions. Long-term trends in a range of acid waters were also reproduced. The model suggests that the sustained nature of observed DOC increases can best be explained by a continuously replenishing potentially-dissolved carbon pool, rather than dissolution of a large accumulated store. The simulations informed the development of hypotheses that: DOC increase is related to plant productivity increase as well as to pH change; DOC increases due to nitrogen pollution will become evident, and be sustained, after soil pH has stabilised.

J	Bridgeman, J; Gulliver, P; Roe, J; Baker, A				Bridgeman, John; Gulliver, Pauline; Roe, Jessie; Baker, Andy			Carbon isotopic characterisation of dissolved organic matter during water treatment	WATER RESEARCH												Water treatment is a series of physio-chemical processes to aid organic matter (OM) removal, which helps to minimise the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products and microbial regrowth. Changes in OM character through the treatment processes can provide insight into the treatment efficiency, but radiogenic isotopic characterisation techniques have yet to be applied. Here, we show for the first time that analysis of C-13 and C-14 of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) effectively characterises dissolved OM through a water treatment works. At the sites investigated: post-clarification, DOC becomes isotopically lighter, due to an increased proportion of relatively hydrophilic DOC. Filtration adds 'old' C-14-DOC from abrasion of the filter media, whilst the use of activated carbon adds 'young' C-14-DOC, most likely from the presence of biofilms. Overall, carbon isotopes provide clear evidence for the first time that new sources of organic carbon are added within the treatment processes, and that treated water is isotopically lighter and typically younger in C-14-DOC age than untreated water. We anticipate our findings will precipitate real-time monitoring of treatment performance using stable carbon isotopes, with associated improvements in energy and carbon footprint (e.g. isotopic analysis used as triggers for filter washing and activated carbon regeneration) and public health benefits resulting from improved carbon removal.

In this study, anti-estrogenic activity removal efficiency by ozonation in the tertiary treatment process of domestic wastewater was investigated. The anti-estrogenic activity in the secondary effluents used in this study ranged between 0.95 and 2.00 mg-TAM L-1 and decreased significantly after ozonation. The removal efficiency of anti-estrogenic activity at a dose of 10 mg-O-3 L-1 was 65-87%. The removal of the anti-estrogenic activity was highly correlated with the removal of UV254, suggesting that UV254 can be used as a surrogate for anti-estrogenic activity during ozonation. The results of size exclusion chromatography of the wastewater samples during ozonation showed that the UV254 absorbance of the DOM fraction with large apparent molecular weight (MW) around 7.6 k Da dropped significantly, and the DOM fraction was suspected to be humic substances which have been previously identified as anti-estrogenic constituents in secondary effluents. The excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra of the wastewater samples proved that humic substances existed in the DOM and indeed reacted with the ozone. With the help of two-dimensional correlation of Fourier transform infrared, it was confirmed that the aromatic structures in the DOM were largely destroyed by ozonation. Therefore, it was suggested that the destruction of the aromatic structures in the DOM was related to the removal of the anti-estrogenic activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sieczko, A; Peduzzi, P				Sieczko, Anna; Peduzzi, Peter			Origin, enzymatic response and fate of dissolved organic matter during flood and non-flood conditions in a river-floodplain system of the Danube (Austria)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Spectroscopic techniques and extracellular enzyme activity measurements were combined with assessments of bacterial secondary production (BSP) to elucidate flood-pulse-linked differences in carbon (C) sources and related microbial processes in a river-floodplain system near Vienna (Austria). Surface connection with the main channel significantly influenced the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in floodplain backwaters. The highest values of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) were observed during the peak of the flood, when DOC increased from 1.36 to 4.37 mg l(-1) and CDOM from 2.94 to 14.32 m(-1). The flood introduced DOC which consisted of more allochthonously-derived, aromatic compounds. Bacterial enzymatic activity, as a proxy to track the response to changes in DOM, indicated elevated utilization of imported allochthonous material. Based on the enzyme measurements, new parameters were calculated: metabolic effort and enzymatic indices (EEA 1 and EEA 2). During connection, bacterial glucosidase and protease activity were dominant, whereas during disconnected phases a switch to lignin degradation (phenol oxidase) occurred. The enzymatic activity analysis revealed that flooding mobilized reactive DOM, which then supported bacterial metabolism. No significant differences in overall BSP between the two phases were detected, indicating that heterogeneous sources of C sufficiently support BSP. The study demonstrates that floods are important for delivering DOM, which, despite its allochthonous origin, is reactive and can be effectively utilized by aquatic bacteria in this river-floodplain systems. The presence of active floodplains, characterized by hydrological connectivity with the main channel, creates the opportunity to process allochthonous DOC. This has potential consequences for carbon flux, enhancing C sequestration and mineralization processes in this river-floodplain system.

The HPCCC solvent system involved a normal-phase approach with water/methanol (1:1) as the lower stationary phase and hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1) as the upper mobile phase. The critical experiment parameters were optimised: revolution speed 1800 rpm and flow rate 0.15 mL/min. Under these conditions 50 L of a 0.50 mg/mL DOM solution was loaded. The detection wavelength was monitored at 330 nm in order to isolate the main portion of DOM, which includes substances such as carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules. By optimising this system it was possible to isolate materials that, according to GC-MS, can be related to molecules with an analogous structural background. Where fraction analysis was not suitable for GC-MS, RP-HPLC with UV absorbance detection was used, showing unique chromatograms for each fraction at both 210 and 330 nm.

The analysis of ADOM and naturally occurring DOM samples using IEC-PAD resulted in chromatograms suggesting very similar composition, each characterised by three early eluting peaks, the latter of which being a broad co-elution of multiple compounds. For naturally occurring DOM, several sugars, including arabinose, glucose, galactose, xylose and ribose, could also be identified. The three distinctive peaks obtained from IEC-PAD of ADOM were collected and further analysed by means of reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (RPLC-HRMS), the latter showing that glucose was totally consumed during microbial production of ADOM and potentially transformed into higher molecular weight materials and CO2.

The compost sources studied included dairy cattle manure (DCM), kitchen waste (MW), cabbage waste (CW), tomato stem waste (TSW), municipal solid waste (MSW), green waste (GW), chicken manure (CM), and peat (P). Conventional and EEM fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the DOM of these composts contained compounds similar in structure but comparisons between conventional fluorescence parameters and fluorescence regional integration of EEM fluorescence spectra showed that the DOM was different in degree of humification. Regression analysis demonstrated significant corrections between major fluorescence parameters. In hierarchical cluster analysis, these composts were clustered into 2 groups and 4 subgroups, and projection pursuit regression analysis further ranked the compost sources as KW, CW, P> CM, DCM, TW, GW> MSW in their degree of humification in DOM.

The results indicated that the CDOM abundance decreased and the aromaticity increased from the upstream to the downstream areas of the estuary. Higher CDOM abundance and degrees of humification were observed in the pore water than that in the surface and bottom waters. Two humic-like components (C1 and C3) and one tryptophan-like component (C2) were identified using the PARAFAC model. The separation of the samples by PCA highlighted the differences in the DOM properties. Components Cl and C3 concurrently displayed positive factor 1 loadings with nearly zero factor 2 loadings, while C2 showed highly positive factor 2 loadings. The Cl and C3 were very similar and exhibited a direct relationship with A355 and DOC. The CDOM in the pore water increased along the river to the coastal area, which was mainly influenced by Cl and C3 and was significantly derived from sediment remineralization and deposition from the inflow of the Yangtze River. The CDOM in the surface and bottom waters was dominated by C2, especially in the inflows of multiple tributaries that were affected by intensive anthropogenic activities. The microbial degradation of exogenous wastes from the tributary inputs and shoreside discharges were dominant sources of the CDOM in the surface and bottom waters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We reported the spatial variability of DOM quantity and composition which collected from Lake Wuliangsuhai in arid and semi-arid region. This study could serve as a useful tool to assess the dynamics of DOM in similar complex wetlands or lakes and provide a support for ecological environment governance and restoration. The results showed that five fluorescent components, including three humic-like (C1, C2 and C4), and two protein-like components (C3 and C5), can be identified by excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) in Lake Wuliangsuhai. The spatial variation of the components showed the difference in the dominant fluorescent component. There were dominant protein-like component C5 and humic-like component C2 in water and pore water. Components C3 and C4 were the main fluorescent components in 0-10 cm sediments. In 10-20 cm sediments, C1 and C3 were the dominant humic-like and protein-like component respectively. The PARAFAC-PCA displayed four PCA factors. The humic-like components C2 and C4 concurrently showed positive factor 1 loadings. Factor 2 was mainly explained by terrestrial and marine humic-like component C1. The autochthonous, tryptophan-like, fluorescent component C3, showed positive factor 3 loadings. The autochthonous, tyrosine-like, fluorescence component C5, having a low factor loading in other three factors, showed extremely high factor 4 loading. The EEM-PARAFAC combined with PCA showed varying contributions of terrestrial versus autochthonous DOM sources for the different regions in the wetland, suggesting that differences in human activities control DOM dynamics.

In the present study, 1 multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT); 2 types of DOM (fulvic acid and tannic acid), and 2 PAHs (pyrene and chrysene) were selected to study the influence of MWNT with preloaded and coexisting DOM on the bioaccumulation of PAHs to Chironomus plumosus larvae in sediment. Moreover, the freely dissolved concentrations of PAHs were measured to explore the influence mechanisms. The results showed that despite the presence or absence of preloaded or coexisting DOM, the presence of 1% MWNT in sediments suppressed the biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) and elevated the water-based bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of PAHs. However, the BSAF and BAF values generally decreased with the increase of 2 forms of both DOM; this was caused by the combined impact of DOM and MWNT on the freely dissolved concentrations of PAHs and the ingestion behavior of benthic organisms.

Size fractionation and optical properties of dissolved organic matter in the continuum soil solution-bog-river and terminal lake of a boreal watershed	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The size distribution and speciation of organic matter (OM) in soil solution, bog, stream, and humic and clearwater lake in the north boreal zone (Karelia region, north west Russia) during the summer base-flow period for several years were investigated. The samples were filtered in the field using cascade filtration through progressively decreasing pore size (100, 20, 10, 5, 0.8, 0.4, 0.22, 0.1, 0.046 mu m, 100 kDa, 10 kDa and 1 kDa) followed by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, UV-vis and size exclusion chromatography measurements. Surrogate parameters, such as specific UV absorbance (SUVA; absorbance at 254 nm normalized for DOC concentration in l mg (1) m (1)) and the absorbance ratios E-254/E-436, E-280/E-350, E-254/E-365, E-365/E-470 and E-470/E-655 (ratio of spectrophotometric absorbance of the sample at two wavelengths) were applied for the characterization of OM in filtered and ultrafiltered water from soil solution, bog, river and lake. In the < 0.22 mu m filtrates, there was a systematic decrease in DOC concentration, C/N ratio, SUVA (hydrophobicity and aromaticity) and proportion of colloidal (1 kDa-0.22 mu m) OC along the watershed profile from peat bog soil solution, feeding humic lake, to the middle course of the stream towards the terminal oligotrophic lake. Within the filtrates and ultrafiltrates of soil solution and terminal lake, C/N increased from 100 to 140 and from 7 to 25 for 0.22-10 mu m and < 1 kDa fractions, respectively. SUVA, degree of humification, hydrophobicity and aromaticity generally increased from high molecular weight (HMW) to low molecular weight (LMW) fractions, being highest in the < 1 kDa fraction. The results allowed a comprehensive view of DOM transport and transformation among various size fractions within a small boreal watershed that can serve as an analogue of small rivers discharge to the Arctic Ocean. It follows that, during the summer baseflow season, the signature of organic-rich interstitial soil solutions originating in a typical peat bog zone can be completely masked by processes occurring in adjacent bog surface waters feeding lakes, as well as in the stream itself. As such, depending on local landscape, one may expect extremely high variability in both chemical nature and MW of DOM delivered by small coastal watersheds to the Arctic Ocean during the summer baseflow period.

The spatial distribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nitrates in the groundwater was created, in order to understand the role of local planning in the quality of groundwater. Spectroscopic ratios, derived from the fluorescence data, evidenced high concentration of microbial DOM as a cause of nearby sheepfolds and poor management of domestic/ animal wastes. Nitrates concentration exceeded the maximum admitted limit in some wells due to soil infiltration from agricultural practices and animal wastes. The study has shown that groundwater is negatively influenced by animal sheds, the local cemetery and natural pools, whose effect is amplified by the area's geomorphological features.

Langmuir and Freundlich Isotherm Evaluation	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												The behavior and fate of mercury (Hg) in soil is mainly controlled by adsorption and desorption processes with various adsorbents, particularly dissolved organic matter (DOM). This study was conducted to assess the effect of DOM from wheat straw (DOMw) and swine manure (DOMs) on Hg (II) adsorption of black, red, and fluvo-aquic soils in China. Results showed that the Hg (II) adsorption isotherms fitted well with Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The maximum Hg (II) potential adsorption capacity by the three soils followed this trend: black soil > red soil > fluvo-aquic soil. The amount of Hg (II) adsorbed on the soils significantly decreased when DOMw and DOMs were added to the soil samples. Furthermore, the extent by which DOMw affected the Hg (II) adsorption of the three soils was higher than the effect of equivalent amounts of DOMs. Therefore, DOM is important to determine the fate of Hg (II) and control Hg (II) pollution in the environment.

The absorption coefficient (a(350)) in the freshwater end-member ranged from 0.15 to 12.5 m(-1) among estuaries. The a(350) and fluorescence intensities correlated positively with population density and the chlorophyll a concentration, likely due to the additions of CDOM from anthropogenic activities and autochthonous production. The freshwater a(350) also correlated negatively with precipitation, headwater altitude and freshwater discharge. The a(350) generally decreased linearly with increasing salinity in most estuaries. Humic-like fluorescent components had intensities strongly correlated with a(350), while protein-like components received notable additions in five estuaries but were removed in another five estuaries. The absorption spectral slope (S275-295) and slope ratio (S-R; 275-295 nm slope: 350-400 nm slope) generally increased with increasing salinity, likely reflecting a decrease in the average molecular weight. The contribution of protein-like components to the total fluorescence changed greatly among different estuaries, which was in part associated with river population density and precipitation. The results showed that both the catchment characteristics and estuarine biogeochemical processes contributed to the variations of CDOM level and composition in estuarine environments.

The highest values of CDOM absorption coefficient at 305 nm (a(CDOM)(305)), were recorded at the continental margins of the English Channel and Patagonian Shelf. The lowest values of a(CDOM)(305) were observed in the mixed layer of both North and South Atlantic subtropical oligotrophic gyres. The DOM composition was assessed using fluorescence spectroscopy, Excitation Emission Matrix spectra (EEMs) and the Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model in addition to spectral indices calculated from CDOM absorption spectrum and EEMs. Six different components were identified in the EEMs by PARAFAC: Two components were similar to the humic-like fraction of DOM, associated with basin scale microbial mineralization processes. These components represent allochthonous DOM in the biogeographic provinces studied. One component of marine humic-like material of autochthonous origin was associated with DOM production from marine phytoplankton. Three components were associated with protein-like DOM. Two protein-like components had the spectral characteristics of pure tryptophan and tyrosine. There was a significant difference in DOM composition both between bio-geographical provinces and above and below the mixed layer. In the mixed layer in all provinces, except the waters of the Western European Shelf, the DOM was dominated by protein-like components. At the Western European Shelf, it was dominated by humic-like components. Fluorescence intensities of humic-like components were high at the Patagonian Shelf, but were up to 40% lower compared to northern hemisphere shelf waters. Humic-like components made a significant contribution to the DOM composition of the upper mesopelagic layer in all provinces, with the highest values at the Equatorial Upwelling Zone. There was a significant inverse relationship between humic-like components and salinity and temperature and a positive relationship with Apparent Oxygen Utilization. The humification index (HIX) was linearly correlated with the intensity of the humic-like DOM components. These trends suggest that the humic-like components are in dynamic equilibrium between likely microbial production in the deep ocean and photochemical degradation in the mixed layer.

J	Takeda, K; Moriki, M; Oshiro, W; Sakugawa, H				Takeda, Kazuhiko; Moriki, Makoto; Oshiro, Wakako; Sakugawa, Hiroshi			Determination of phenolic concentrations in dissolved organic matter pre-concentrate using solid phase extraction from natural water	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The concentrations of phenolic moieties in dissolved organic matter pre-concentrated by solid phase extraction (SPE-DOM) from river water and seawater were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent. Samples were taken from four rivers in the Hiroshima Prefecture of western Japan, and the Seto-Inland Sea. Phenolic concentrations in river samples increased with increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. In river water, the phenolic concentrations per unit of carbon in SPE-DOM were in the range of 0.48-1.91 mol kg(-1)-C. In seawater samples, relationships between phenolic and DOC concentrations were not clear, and the phenolic concentrations per unit of carbon were in the range of 0.07-0.76 mol kg(-1)-C. In Osaka Bay, which is a typical enclosed urban coastal area with a large river, phenolic concentrations in the surface seawater collected near the river mouth were higher than those at offshore points. A river water-seawater end-member conservative mixing model indicated that phenolic moieties of DOM in Osaka Bay are characterized by a "net loss" during mixing in the bay. To understand their characteristic behaviors, the photochemical and biological effects on the variation of phenolic concentrations in DOM were investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of pH, temperature, salinity, and dissolved organic matter on the photolysis of 2,4-dinitrotoluene and 2,6-dinitrotoluene in seawater	MARINE CHEMISTRY												In this study, the influence of salinity, nitrate, pH, temperature, and dissolved organic matter on the rate of photolysis of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT) in marine, estuary, and laboratory-prepared waters was measured. Photochemical degradation was studied using a Suntest CPS+(R) solar simulator equipped with various filters designed to select specific regions of the solar spectrum. Degradation rates of the compounds were determined using HPLC analysis, and product formation was determined using LC/MS. DNT photolysis rates were influenced by the wavelength of the light irradiating the compound; 295, 305, and 320 nm long-pass filter exposures produced similar degradation rates while 385 and 395 nm filter exposures produced minimal or no degradation. Under the 295-nm filter, first-order DNT degradation rate constants increased with increasing salinity for both natural seawater and artificial seawater. The 2,6-DNT rate constants did change significantly when the pH (7.2 to 8.1), temperature (10 to 32 degrees C), and nitrate (up to 4 mM) were varied over the range of values found in marine waters. Similar results were found for 2,4-DNT, except for temperature where the rate constant increased slightly with increasing temperature. The addition of dissolved organic matter (up to, 10 mg/L) to ultrapure water, artificial seawater (salinity = 9), and natural seawater enhanced the photolysis of 2,6-DNT, while it only enhanced the photolysis of 2,4-DNT in the ultrapure and artificial seawater (salinity = 9). Products formed by 2,4-DNT photolysis in natural seawater were 2,4-dinitrobenzaldehyde, 2,4-dinitrobenzylnitrile, and 2-amino,4-nitrobenzoic acid. The photolysis of 2,6-DNT in natural seawater formed 2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde, 2,6-dinitrobenzyl alcohol, and 2,6-dinitrobenzylnitrile. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Evidence of Considerable Photoreactivity in an Extreme Environment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Water samples from shallow lakes located in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, were taken in the austral summer season and characterized for chemical composition, optical features, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and photoactivity toward the generation of (OH)-O-center dot, O-1(2), and (CDOM)-C-3* (triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter). The optical properties suggested that CDOM would be largely of aquagenic origin and possibly characterized by limited photochemical processing before sampling. Moreover, the studied samples were highly photoactive and the quantum yields for the generation of (CDOM)-C-3* and partially of O-1(2) and (OH)-O-center dot were considerably higher compared to water samples from temperate environments. This finding suggests that water in the studied lakes would have considerable ability to photosensitize the degradation of dissolved compounds during the austral summer, possibly including organic pollutants, also considering that the irradiance conditions of the experiments were not far from those observed on the Antarctic coast during the austral summer.

Variations in high-latitude riverine fluorescent dissolved organic matter: A comparison of large Arctic rivers	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Given the pace of climate change, it is important to better understand dissolved organic matter (DOM) storage and cycling in high-latitude rivers and its subsequent export to the Arctic Ocean. To address this concern, excitation/emission matrix spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) coupled with optical indices were used to characterize the optical properties of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) and colored DOM (CDOM) in five large Arctic rivers over two seasonal cycles. Five PARAFAC components were identified and proved useful indicators for the quantitative and qualitative descriptions of DOM sources and modification processes within Arctic watersheds. In comparing Pan-Arctic relationships between the optical properties and chemical properties of DOM, three components traced terrigenous biomarkers and two components are introduced as potential indicators for microbial processing. Conversely, no individual PARAFAC component could be directly linked to a specific plant source or river and simpler absorbance indices (i.e., a(350)) proved to be better suited to quantify dissolved organic carbon and lignin phenol concentrations. Differences in FDOM character between the rivers could be explained by general watershed characteristics, including vegetation, topography, and hydrology. Based on these differences, the influence of coniferous vegetation on DOM character is most apparent in the Lena and Yenisei Rivers and bog-derived FDOM sources are more important in the Ob River. This study illustrates how increased hydrological connectivity in the Ob catchment and the abundance of lakes within the Mackenzie watershed may influence FDOM concentrations and the microbial processing of DOM within these watersheds.

Inner filter correction of dissolved organic matter fluorescence	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is suppressed by a phenomenon of self-quenching known as the inner filter effect (IFE). Despite widespread use of fluorescence to characterize DOM in surface waters, the advantages and constraints of IFE correction are poorly defined. We assessed the effectiveness of a commonly used absorbance-based approach (ABA), and a recently proposed controlled dilution approach (CDA) to correct for IFE. Linearity between corrected fluorescence and total absorbance (A(Total); the sum of absorbance at excitation and emission wavelengths) across the full excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in dilution series of four samples indicated both ABA and CDA were effective to an absorbance of at least 1.5 in a 1 cm cell, regardless of wavelength positioning. In regions of the EEMs where signal to background noise (S/N) was low, CDA correction resulted in more variability than ABA correction. From the ABA algorithm, the onset of significant IFE (>5%) occurs when absorbance exceeds 0.042. In these cases, IFE correction is required, which was the case for the vast majority (97%) of lakes in a nationwide survey (n = 554). For highly absorbing samples, undesirably large dilution factors would be necessary to reduce absorbance below 0.042. For rare EEMs with A(Total) > 1.5 (3.0% of the lakes in the Swedish survey), a 2-fold dilution is recommended followed by ABA or CDA correction. This study shows that for the vast majority of natural DOM samples the most commonly applied ABA algorithm provides adequate correction without prior dilution.

Characterisation and dynamics of dissolved organic matter in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM), focusing on the influence of thermal stratification and mixing. Samples were collected at the surface, 500 m and 1500 m, in April, July and October 2004 at the DYFAMED time-series site in the North-western Mediterranean. High molecular weight (HMW) DOM was concentrated using ultrafiltration. The HMW DOM fraction was characterised by H-1 NMR, amino acid and neutral sugar analysis. Results were interpreted in the context of the wealth of information available on site DYFAMED. Three key observations were made. Firstly, the carbohydrate component of DOM decreased with depth, in agreement with previous studies, indicating degradation of this labile material. Secondly, the July surface water sample was particularly carbohydrate rich; it is proposed this may be the result of increased carbohydrate production by phytoplankton under low nutrient conditions, and accumulation in the surface layers due to stratification of the water column. Finally, the October samples showed a distinctly different chemical signature to the April and July samples, potentially indicating a shift from a net production system in the spring and summer to a net re-mineralisation system in autumn. The results of this study offer an insight into the dynamic nature of DOM at station DYFAMED. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) onto the synthetic iron pipe corrosion scales (goethite and magnetite): Effect of pH	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												This study was performed to investigate dissolved organic matter (DOM) adsorption equilibrium using synthetic iron pipe corrosion scales i.e. goethite and magnetite for different pH values ranging from 2.5 to 10.5. The synthesized goethite and magnetite was characterized by XRD, SEM and BET surface area. SEM micrographs for before and after DOM adsorption study revealed a significant change on the morphology of goethite and magnetite surface. Molecular weight distributions of DOM measured by HPSEC revealed that the higher molecular weight fractions adsorbed preferentially onto goethite and magnetite surface, and it was pronouncedly observed at lower pH. The DOM adsorption data illustrated to be fit well by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating monolayer coverage. The standard Gibb's free energy (6,Cads) changes of adsorption process stating the DOM adsorption onto goethite and magnetite surface was spontaneous under the experimental conditions. However, the maximal adsorption capacity for goethite and magnetite were revealed to be 4.75 mg-C/g and 3.79 mg-C/g respectively at pH 2.5. The DOM adsorption study was observed to be highly pH dependent. Consequently, zeta (xi) potential measurements revealed that surface charge of goethite and magnetite was modified due to DOM adsorption onto their surfaces, and their pH for point zero charge (pH(PZC)) was shifted to lower pH compared to that of in absence of DOM. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that ligand exchange between carboxyl/hydroxyl functional groups of DOM and, goethite and magnetite surface was the leading interaction mechanism for DOM adsorption process. FTIR spectroscopy study was in agreement with the conclusion cited above. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

DIEL CHANGES OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER IN STREAMS OF VARYING WATERSHED LAND USE	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												We examined diel changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) under summer low-flow conditions for six streams selected across a gradient of agricultural land use intensity (21%-73% cropland). Trends in concentration [dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration] and optical properties of DOM showed a high degree of synchrony. During a 24-h period, DOC changed by between 2.9 and 4.3mgL(-1). For all sites, the highest DOC was observed during dark periods and the lowest concentration during light periods. DOM sampled during daylight hours was more complex (humic) as determined using specific absorbance. DOM source, measured using fluorescence spectroscopy, usually varied during the 24-h period, but few similarities in temporal fluorescence trends were identified between sites. Human landscape alterations appear to have little direct influence on the temporal nature of diel DOM dynamics in our study region. However, our results indicate that landscape characteristics are likely more broadly important in defining the magnitude temporal change in DOC. Woodland areas were negatively correlated with early afternoon DOC (r(2)=0.89, p=0.005), positively correlated with diel percent change in DOC (r(2)=0.87, p=0.007) and positively with diel change in discharge (r(2)=0.64, p=0.054). Together, these results indicate the likely influence of differing riparian transpiration rates and changing subsurface inputs on DOC loading. Reduced DOC and discharge rates during daylight hours resulted in a mean underestimation of DOC export rate by 61% for early afternoon versus early morning sampling. Variation in the dominant source of DOM entering theses streams was strongly related to agricultural land use, and DOM in high cropland streams was more microbially derived. In addition, high cropland streams also exhibited the lowest minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations, a pattern related to high rates of productivity at these sites.

Absorption, fluorescence and composition characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are presented using the absorption spectroscopy, the excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model based on the data collected in Sep. -Oct. 2007 including 15, 9 and 10 samplings in Lake Honghu, Lake Donghu and Lake Liangzihu, respectively. CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm a(350) coefficient in Lake Honghu was significantly higher than those in Lake Donghu and Lake Liangzihu (t-test, p<0. 001). A significant negative correlation was found between CDOM spectral slope in the wavelength range of 280 similar to 500 nm (S-280 similar to 500) and a(350) (R-2 = 0. 781, p<0. 001). The mean value of S-280 similar to 500 in Lake Honghu was significantly lower than those in Lake Donghu (t-test, p<0. 01) and Lake Liangzihu (t-test, p<0. 001). The mean value of spectral slope ratio SR in Lake Honghu was also significantly lower than those in Lake Donghu and Lake Liangzihu (t-test, p<0. 05). Two humic-like (C1, C2) and two protein-like fluorescent components (C3, C4) were identified by PARAFAC model, among which significant positive correlations were found between C1 and C2 (R-2=0. 884, p<0. 001), C3 and C4 (R-2=0. 677, p<0. 001), respectively, suggesting that the sources of the two humic-like components as well as the two protein-like components were similar. However, no significant correlation has been found between those 4 fluorescent components and DOC concentration. The fluorescence indices of FI255 (HIX), FI265, FI310(BIX) and FI370 in Lake Donghu were all significantly higher than those in Lake Liangzihu (t-test, p <0. 05) and Lake Honghu (t-test, p<0. 01), indicating that the eutrophication status in Lake Donghu was higher than Lake Honghu and Lake Liangzihu.																	1000-0593					DEC	2013	33	12					3286	3292		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2013)12-3286-07						WOS:000328710600025

The results of synchronous fluorescence spectra analysis showed that DOM in the wavelength range of 250 similar to 320 run with all the molecular weight and in the wavelength>320 nm with molecular weight>1 KDa was removed obviously by the pretreatment processes. The results of three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) fluorescence spectra showed that the pretreatment processes removed low-excitation wavelength tyrosine-like, low-excitation wavelength tryptophan-like and high-excitation wavelength tryptophan-like with all the molecular weight off, and fulvic-like matter and high-excitation wave length tyrosine-like with molecular weight>1 KDa effectively. The results of UV-Vis spectra analysis showed that the pretreatment processes removed DOM of molecular weight>1 KDa with pi-pi* transition and DOM of all molecular weight with conjugated system of the benzene ring structure. It was concluded that the removal of both fulvic-like matter and high-excitation wave length tyrosine-like with the wavelength>320 nm, molecular weight<1 KDa and with pi-pi* transition should be strengthened for controlling (RO) membrane fouling, when leachate was treated by RO with the pretreatment processes of "biochemical(UASB+A/O)and UF".																	1000-0593					DEC	2013	33	12					3312	3317		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2013)12-3312-06						WOS:000328710600030

Bacterial abundance, bacterial production, concentrations of DOC, total dissolved amino acids (TDAA), and total dissolved neutral sugars (TDNS) were monitored during the experiments. Bacterial production during the first few days was very high (20 to 35 mu g C liter(-1) day(-1)), accounting for 40 to 70% of primary production. The total bacterial production accounted for 34 to 55% of the DOC loss during the experiment, indicating high bacterial activities in Lake Kasumigaura. The DOC degradation was only 12 to 15%, whereas the degradation of TDAA and TDNS ranged from 30 to 50%, suggesting the preferential usage of TDAA and TDNS. The contribution of bacterially derived carbon to a DOC pool in Lake Kasumigaura was estimated using D-amino acids as bacterial biomarkers and accounted for 30 to 50% of the lake DOC. These values were much higher than those estimated for the open ocean (20 to 30%). The ratio of bacterially derived carbon to bulk carbon increased slightly with time, suggesting that the bacterially derived carbon is more resistant to microbial degradation than bulk carbon. This is the first study to estimate the bacterial contribution to a DOC pool in freshwater environments. These results indicate that bacteria play even more important roles in carbon cycles in freshwater environments than in open oceans and also suggests that recent increases in recalcitrant DOC in various lakes could be attributed to bacterially derived carbon. The potential differences in bacterial contributions to dissolved organic matter (DOM) between freshwater and marine environments are discussed.																	0099-2240	1098-5336				DEC	2013	79	23					7160	7168		10.1128/AEM.01504-13						WOS:000327544700006	24038686

Viral lysis of Micromonas pusilla: impacts on dissolved organic matter production and composition	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The viral mediated transformation of phytoplankton organic carbon to dissolved forms ("viral shunt") has been suggested as a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in marine systems. Despite the potential implications of viral activity on the global carbon fluxes, studies investigating changes in the DOC composition from viral lysis is still lacking. Micromonas pusilla is an ecologically relevant picoeukaryotic phytoplankter, widely distributed in both coastal and oceanic marine waters. Viruses have been found to play a key role in regulating the population dynamics of this species. In this study we used axenic cultures of exponentially growing M. pusilla to determine the impact of viral lysis on the DOC concentration and composition, as estimated from lysate-derived production of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and two fractions of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM): aromatic amino acids (excitation/emission; 280/320 nm; F(280/320)) and marine humic-like fluorescent DOM (320/410 nm; F(320/410)). DOC concentration increased 4.5 times faster and reached 2.6 times higher end concentration in the viral infected compared with the non-infected cultures. The production of F(280/320) and F(320/410) were 4.1 and 2.8 times higher in the infected cultures, and the elevated ratio between F(280/320) and F(320/410) in lysates suggested a higher contribution of labile (protein) components in viral produced DOM than in algal exudates. The TEP production was 1.8 times faster and reached a 1.5 times higher level in the viral infected M. pusilla culture compared with the non- infected cultures. The measured increase in both DOC and TEP concentrations suggests that viral lysis has multiple and opposite implications for the production and export processes in the pelagic ocean: (1) by releasing host biomass as DOC it decreases the organic matter sedimentation and promotes respiration and nutrient retention in the photic zone, whereas (2) the observed enhanced TEP production could stimulate particle aggregation and thus carbon export out of the photic zone.

Based on spatial distributions, as well as relationships with salinity, the following assignments were made. The three humic-like components (C1, C2 and C3) showed conservative mixing behavior and came mainly from riverine input. The protein-like component (C4) was considered a combination of autochthonous production and terrestrial inputs and a biologically labile component. Path analysis of samples from the middle and bottom layers revealed that the causal effects on C1 were -78.46% for salinity, and -21.54% for apparent oxygen utilization (AOU); those on C2 were -76.43% for salinity, and -23.57% for AOU; those on C3 were -70.49% for salinity, 7.01% for Chl-a, and -22.50% for AOU; those on C4 were -55.54% for salinity, 14.6% for Chl-a, and -29.86% for AOU in middle layer; and those on C4 were -57.37% for salinity, 29.02% for Chl-a, and -13.61% for AOU in bottom layer. Results indicated that CDOM in the East China Sea was mainly affected by terrestrial inputs, and microbial activities also played a key role in biogeochemical processes of CDOM. The application of the EEM-PARAFAC model presented a unique opportunity to observe compositional changes in CDOM in the East China Sea. In addition, the humification index (HIX) suggested that CDOM from the East China Sea was less stable and stayed shorter in the environment.																	1674-7291	1869-1870				DEC	2013	56	12					1790	1799		10.1007/s11426-013-4949-y						WOS:000328211300015		
J	Zhang, JH; He, MC				Zhang, Jinghuan; He, Mengchang			Effect of dissolved organic matter on sorption and desorption of phenanthrene onto black carbon	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Sorption and desorption of phenanthrene (PHE) onto black carbon (BC) extracted from sediments were studied in the presence of three types of dissolved organic matter (DOM), including L-phenylalanine (L-PH), peptone and citric acid. The nonlinearity of the sorption isotherms increased in the presence of DOM. The presence of L-PH reduced the sorption capacity and desorption hysteresis because of the solubilization of PHE in L-PH solution. Peptone at 50-500 mg/L also led to a decrease in sorption attributed to solubilization, although the sorbed peptone on the BC surface could slightly increase PHE sorption. Unlike L-PH and peptone, citric acid enhanced the sorption capacity and irreversibility of PHE on BC mainly due to the strong sorption of citric acid on the BC surface. Our results may help to understand the different impacts of DOM on the distribution and transport of PAH in the environment.

Characterization of IHSS Pony Lake fulvic acid dissolved organic matter by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We present the extensive characterization of Antarctic Pony Lake (PL) dissolved organic matter (DOM), an International Humic Substance Society (IHSS) fulvic acid (FA) reference standard, using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEMS). PLFA is the first reference standard available through IHSS derived solely from a microbial source. A number of factors differentiate PLFA from other IHSS standards, including source material, geographic location, sunlight exposure, freeze-thaw conditions, and other in situ environmental influences. ESI FT-ICR MS and EEMS were used to compare the PLFA microbial DOM compositional signature with the IHSS Suwannee River (SR) FA, a standard frequently studied for environmental DOM analysis. Although CcHhOoNnSs (n = 0, 1, or 2 and s = 0 or 1) constituents were present in both IHSS samples, PLFA contained more N and S molecular species, whereas SRFA was dominated by CcHhOo compounds. Proteinaceous character was detected with both methods, in greater abundance for PLFA, which we attributed to its microbial source material and labile, potentially more reactive nature than SRFA. Characterization from both analytical techniques resulted in complementary data that reinforce the importance of PLFA as an IHSS reference standard that should be utilized for other microbiological environmental DOM comparisons.

J	Olefeldt, D; Turetsky, MR; Blodau, C				Olefeldt, David; Turetsky, Merritt R.; Blodau, Christian			Altered Composition and Microbial versus UV-Mediated Degradation of Dissolved Organic Matter in Boreal Soils Following Wildfire	ECOSYSTEMS												Production, transport, and degradation of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) influence carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in both soils and downstream aquatic ecosystems. Here, we assessed the impacts of wildfire on DOM production, composition, and reactivity (biodegradation versus UV degradation) from soils of upland forest and peatland ecosystems. Soil C solubility was lowest for upland char samples, highest from surface soils in unburned spruce stands and decreased with a higher degree of peat humification regardless of fire history. Soil nitrogen (N) became relatively more soluble in both upland and peat soils post-fire, as leachate C/N decreased. Biodegradability was lower for DOM leachates from burned than unburned soils, both in upland and peatland sites. Several DOM composition indices were related to biodegradability; with the strongest relationship for specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (indicator of aromaticity). Parallel factor analysis revealed distinctive characteristics of leachates from burned soils and char that were related to low biodegradability and high UV-mediated losses. Relative to dark incubations, incubation under UV conditions led to greater C losses for highly aromatic leachates, but reduced losses for leachates with low aromaticity. This suggests that UV-mediated degradation could provide a pathway for highly stable terrestrial organic matter, including char, to become rapidly mineralized and released to the atmosphere once it reaches aquatic ecosystems in dissolved form. Together our results demonstrate that wildfire can potentially alter both turnover of DOM in terrestrial soils and linkages between terrestrial and aquatic C cycling through its influence on terrestrial DOM production and composition.

A biophysical approach to understand the marine carbon cycle	BIOPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY												This study reports the first information on extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) combined with a study of DOM dynamics at the Arno River mouth. DOM dynamics was investigated from both a quantitative (dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and a qualitative (absorption and fluorescence of chromophoric DOM, CDOM) perspective. The data here reported highlight that the Arno River was an important source of both DOC and CDOM for this coastal area. CDOM optical properties suggested that terrestrial DOM did not undergo simple dilution at the river mouth but, other physical-chemical and biological processes were probably at work to change its molecular characteristics. This observation was further supported by the "potential" enzymatic activity of beta-glucosidase (BG) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). Their Vmax values were markedly higher in the river water than in the seawater and their ratio suggested that most of the DOM used by microbes in the Arno River was polysaccharide-like, while in the seawater it was mainly protein-like.

J	Catala, TS; Mladenov, N; Echevarria, F; Reche, I				Catala, Teresa S.; Mladenov, Natalie; Echevarria, Fidel; Reche, Isabel			Positive trends between salinity and chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter in a seasonally inverse estuary	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Estuaries present high content of chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM, FDOM) affecting the attenuation of ultraviolet and blue radiation. In temperate and tropical estuaries, the main CDOM source is riverine input that generally mixes conservatively with the oceanic waters leading to negative relationships between CDOM and salinity. In Mediterranean estuaries, riverine inputs are more limited or absent during the dry season producing a negative hydrological budget and, consequently, hypersalinity and an inverse circulation pattern. Much remains to be understood about CDOM and FDOM dynamics during rainy and dry periods in these last estuaries. In this study, we determined DOM absorbance and fluorescence in the Bay of Cadiz, Spain during a rainy (high riverine inputs) and dry (hypersaline conditions) period. We determined the absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(355)) and acquired excitation emission matrices (EEMs). The EEMs showed two fluorescence peaks associated with terrestrial humic-like components (peaks A and C), one peak considered to be a marine humic-like component (peak M), and two peaks considered to be amino acid-like components (peaks T and B). The a(355) values ranged from 030 to 1.99 m(-1) with the highest values during the dry season. From the rainy season to the dry season, the overall fluorescence intensity increased and fluorescent peaks M, B, and T increased by greater than two orders of magnitude, whereas the fluorescence intensities of peaks A and C changed less than one order of magnitude. Unlike temperate and tropical estuaries, the a(355) values and fluorescence of the five peaks were positive and significantly related to salinity, but with different slopes. The inverse nature of the Bay of Cadiz during the dry season could be responsible for these positive trends between CDOM/FDOM and salinity. The slopes of the humic-like peaks A and C were lower than the a(355) slope suggesting their preferential losses, likely due to photobleaching. By contrast, the slopes of the amino acid-like peaks B and T were higher than the a(355) slope suggesting an in situ production of these fluorophores, likely due to diffusion from salt marsh and coastal sediments.

J	Yang, LY; Guo, WD; Hong, HS; Wang, GZ				Yang, Liyang; Guo, Weidong; Hong, Huasheng; Wang, Guizhi			Non-conservative behaviors of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in a turbid estuary: Roles of multiple biogeochemical processes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) may show notable non-conservative behaviors in many estuaries due to a variety of biogeochemical processes. The partition between CDOM and chromophoric particulate organic matter (CPOM) was examined in the Jiulong Estuary (China) using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, which was also compared with microbial and photochemical degradations. The absorption coefficient of water-soluble CPOM (acpom(280)) at ambient Milli-Q water pH (6.1) ranged from Oil to 7.94 m(-1) in the estuary and was equivalent to 5-101% of CDOM absorption coefficient. The acpom(280) correlated significantly with the concentration of suspended particulate matter and was highest in the bottom water of turbidity maximum zone. Absorption spectral slope (S275_295) and slope ratio (SR) correlated positively with salinity for both CPOM and CDOM, suggesting decreases in the average molecular weight with increasing salinity. The adsorption of CDOM to re-suspended sediments (at 500 mg L-1) within 2 h was equivalent to 4-26% of the initial amom(280). The adsorption of CDOM to particles was less selective with respect to various CDOM constituents, while the microbial degradation resulted decreases in S275-295 and SR of CDOM and preferential removal of protein-like components. The partition between CPOM and CDOM represented a rapid and important process for the non-conservative behavior of CDOM in turbid estuaries. (C) 2013, Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interactive effects of copper and dissolved organic matter on sodium uptake, copper bioaccumulation, and oxidative stress in juvenile freshwater mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Freshwater mussels are exceptionally sensitive to many contaminants including metals, but the mechanisms of toxicity are not fully understood. Similarly, our understanding of the protective effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is also undergoing revision, since recent studies have found that DOM may also directly affect organism physiology, in addition to its well known capability in complexing and reducing bioavailability of metals. In the present study, these issues were investigated in juvenile (6-12 months old) freshwater mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea) in moderately-hard reconstituted water (Ca2+ = 0.406 mmol/L; Mg2+ = 0.537 mmol/L; Na+ = 1.261 mmol/L; K+ = 0.077 mmol/L; hardness = 80-100 mg/L CaCO3; pH = 8.02 and DOM = 0.3 mg C/L). Mussels were acutely exposed (24 and 96 h) to Cu (0,2 or 12 mu g Cu/L) combined with three concentrations (0, 3 or 6 mg C/L) of DOM of terrigenous origin (Luther Marsh). We analyzed unidirectional Na+ influx, whole-body ion content (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+), enzyme (Na+/K+-ATPase, H+-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase) activities, copper bioaccumulation and oxidative stress-related parameters. Exposure to DOM alone caused a marked increase in the unidirectional Na+ influx rate and a decrease in v-type H+-ATPase activity, suggesting that DOM alone can cause alterations in membrane transport functions and therefore, whole-body Na+ metabolism. Unidirectional Na+ influx rate and Na+K+-ATPase activity were inhibited when mussels were exposed to the higher Cu concentration tested (12 mu g Cu/L). The influx inhibition was ameliorated by the simultaneous presence of DOM. At this same Cu concentration, DOM also significantly protected mussels against whole-body Na+ and K+ losses associated with Cu exposure, as well as against Cu bioaccumulation. Oxidative stress parameters did not show clear trends across treatments. Overall, our results indicate that Cu is a potent ionoregulatory toxicant to freshwater mussels. They also demonstrate that natural DOM protects against both Cu bioaccumulation and ionoregulatory toxicity, and that at least part of this protection results from direct positive effects of DOM on Na+ metabolism.

J	Helms, JR; Mao, JD; Schmidt-Rohr, K; Abdulla, H; Mopper, K				Helms, John R.; Mao, Jingdong; Schmidt-Rohr, Klaus; Abdulla, Hussain; Mopper, Kenneth			Photochemical flocculation of terrestrial dissolved organic matter and iron	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) rich water samples (Great Dismal Swamp, Virginia) were 0.1-mu m filtered and UV-irradiated in a solar simulator for 30 days. During the irradiation, pH increased, particulate organic matter (POM) and particulate iron formed. After 30 days, 7% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was converted to POC while 75% was remineralized. Approximately 87% of the iron was removed from the dissolved phase after 30 days, but iron did not flocculate until a major fraction of DOM was removed by photochemical degradation and flocculation (> 10 days); thus, during the initial 10 days, there were sufficient organic ligands present or the pH was low enough to keep iron in solution. Nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies indicated that photochemically flocculated POM was more aliphatic than the residual non-flocculated DOM. Photochemically flocculated POM was also enriched in amide functionality, while carbohydrate-like material was resistant to both photochemical degradation and flocculation. Abiotic photochemical flocculation likely removes a significant fraction of terrestrial DOM from the upper water column between headwaters and the ocean, but has previously been ignored. Preliminary evidence suggests that this process may significantly impact the transport of DOM and POM in ocean margin environments including estuaries. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Distinct Optical Chemistry of Dissolved Organic Matter in Urban Pond Ecosystems	PLOS ONE												Urbanization has the potential to dramatically alter the biogeochemistry of receiving freshwater ecosystems. We examined the optical chemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in forty-five urban ponds across southern Ontario, Canada to examine whether optical characteristics in these relatively new ecosystems are distinct from other freshwater systems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from 2 to 16 mg C L-1 across the ponds with an average value of 5.3 mg C L-1. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modelling showed urban pond DOM to be characterized by microbial-like and, less importantly, by terrestrial derived humic-like components. The relatively transparent, non-humic DOM in urban ponds was more similar to that found in open water, lake ecosystems than to rivers or wetlands. After irradiation equivalent to 1.7 days of natural solar radiation, DOC concentrations, on average, decreased by 38% and UV absorbance decreased by 25%. Irradiation decreased the relative abundances of terrestrial humic-like components and increased protein-like aspects of the DOM pool. These findings suggest that high internal production and/or prolonged exposure to sunlight exerts a distinct and significant influence on the chemistry of urban pond DOM, which likely reduces its chemical similarity with upstream sources. These properties of urban pond DOM may alter its biogeochemical role in these relatively novel aquatic ecosystems.

Electrochemical methods that can effectively protect them from oxidation and rapidly obtain results, such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), have been applied to qualitatively analyzing properties of RDOMs. However, the donated amount of electrons from RDOMs as a capacity factor may be more crucial for evaluating their important roles. For the first time, matured chronoamperometry (CA) was applied to quantitatively determining the electron donor capacities of RDOMs in crop residue management. The electron donor capacities of RDOMs from green manure were much higher than those from rice straw, which indicated that the former had greater effect on the redox status and reactions of soil. Chronoamperometry was proposed as a practical and effective method to quantitatively characterize RDOMs from residue decomposition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Indigenous microbes survive in situ ozonation improving biodegradation of dissolved organic matter in aged oil sands process-affected waters	CHEMOSPHERE												The oil sands industry faces significant challenges in developing effective remediation technologies for process-affected water stored in tailings ponds. Naphthenic acids, a complex mixture of cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids, have been of particular concern because they concentrate in tailings ponds and are a component of the acutely toxic fraction of process water. Ozone treatment has been demonstrated as an effective means of rapidly degrading naphthenic acids, reducing process water toxicity, and increasing its biodegradability following seeding with the endogenous process water bacteria. This study is the first to examine subsequent in situ biodegradation following ozone pretreatment. Two aged oil sands process-affected waters from experimental reclamation tailings ponds were ozonated to reduce the dissolved organic carbon, to which naphthenic acids contributed minimally (<1 mg L-1). Treatment with an ozone dose of 50 mg L-1 improved the 84 d biodegradability of remaining dissolved organic carbon during subsequent aerobic incubation (11-13 mg L-1 removed from aged process-affected waters versus 5 mg L-1 when not pretreated with ozone). The ozone-treated indigenous microbial communities were as capable of degrading organic matter as the same community not exposed to ozone. This supports ozonation coupled with biodegradation as an effective and feasible treatment option. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The protein-like FDOM (FDOMT) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed epilimnetic accumulation (FDOMT from 4.42 +/- 0.22 quinine sulfate units [QSU] to 6.30 +/- 0.04 QSU; DOC from 80.8 +/- 2.7 mu mol L-1 to 102.7 +/- 3.5 mu mol L-1) between nutrient-replete winter mixing to nutrient-depleted stratified periods. This accumulation is attributed to the reduced heterotrophic activity following severe P-limitation. The positive correlation between accumulated DOC and FDOMT in the epilimnion and their uniform reduction in the hypolimnion (similar to 9%) suggest FDOMT as a proxy for semi-labile DOM. The humic-like FDOM (FDOMM) generally increased with depth, a pattern similar to nutrients and total carbon dioxide (TCO2), but adverse to dissolved oxygen. The significant positive correlations of FDOMM with apparent oxygen utilization (r = 0.86, p < 0.001), TCO2 (r = 0.91, p < 0.001), nitrate (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), and phosphate (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) in the deeper layers suggest that FDOMM is formed during hypolimnetic mineralization. We estimated that similar to 8% of the organic carbon degraded in the hypolimnion is transferred into humic substances. The minor contribution of DOC (6.4%) to hypolimnetic mineralization suggests that production of humic substances is mainly fueled by the mineralization of sinking biogenic particles. The production and consumption of FDOM in freshwater lakes may influence the quality and bioavailability of carbon exported from these systems.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2013	58	6					2262	2278		10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.2262						WOS:000327395400028

The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on sodium transport and nitrogenous waste excretion of the freshwater cladoceran (Daphnia magna) at circumneutral and low pH	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM), a heterogeneous substance found in all natural waters, has many documented abiotic roles, but recently, several possible direct influences of DOM on organism physiology have been reported. However, most studies have been carried out with a limited number of natural DOM isolates or were restricted to the use of commercial or artificial humic substances. We therefore employed three previously characterized, chemically-distinct natural DOMs, as well as a commercially available humic acid (Aldrich, AHA), at circumneutral (7-8) and acidic pH (similar to 5), to examine DOM effects on whole-body Na+ concentration, unidirectional influx and efflux rates of Na+, and ammonia and urea excretion rates in Daphnia magna. Whole-body Na+ concentration, Na+ influx, and Na+ efflux rates were all unaffected regardless of pH, suggesting no influence of the various natural DOMs on active uptake and passive diffusion of Na+ in this organism. Ammonia and urea excretion rates were both increased by low pH. Ammonia excretion rates were reduced at circumneutral pH by the most highly colored, allochthonous DOM, and at low pH by all three natural DOMs, as well as by the commercial AHA. Urea excretion rates were not influenced by the presence of the various DOMs in circumneutral solutions, but were attenuated by the presence of two allochthonous DOM sources (isolated from Bannister Lake and Luther Marsh) at acidic pH. The observed reductions may be attributed partially to the higher buffering capacities of natural DOM sources, as well as their ability to interact with biological membranes as estimated by a new measure calculated from their add-base titration characteristics, the Proton Binding Index (PBI).

Pumice was used as the inorganic bulking agent to eliminate the influences of conventional organic materials on the analysis result of the biosolid samples. The results showed that the DOC/DTN (1.97-0.83) of the biosolid extract was distinctly lower than the C/N (6.88-7.84) of the biosolid sample; both low DOC/DTN ratio and poor biodegradability of the DOM had the important relation with the nitrogen loss in the biosolid composting process. After 100-days composting, SUVA(254) and SUVA(280) of the aqueous extract were 17.6 and 18.6 times higher than that of the raw biosolid, respectively. Both of them were proved to be the effective indices to evaluate the stability degree of the biosolid. Spectral analysis of the DOM represented significant decline of aromatic proteins, clear rising of humic acid-like organics and slight increase of fulvic acid-like materials during the active phase of composting. The formation of the larger molecules with an amount of carboxylic and aromatic structures was observed in the curing phase.

J	Gueguen, C; Cuss, CW; Chen, WB				Gueguen, Celine; Cuss, Chad W.; Chen, Weibin			Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation and excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analyses of riverine dissolved organic matter isolated by tangential flow ultrafiltration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) with sequential on-line UV/visible and fluorescence detectors was used to investigate the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in permeate and retentate fractions isolated by tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFF) at various concentration factors (i.e. ratio of initial volume to the retentate volume; CF). The permeation coefficient model, which defines the log-log relationship between DOM in the permeate fractions and CFs, described the permeation behaviour of DOM with regression coefficients r(2)>0.99. The dominance of higher-molecular weight retentate chromophoric DOM (CDOM) observed in TFF was consistent with the results of AF4. The weight-averaged molecular weights (M-w) of the integral permeate and retentate at CF=20 were determined to be 1160 and 2320 by AF4, respectively, while their molecular weight distributions (MWD) were centered at 1120 and 1600Da. M-w, MWD, and aromaticity (i.e. ratio of absorbance at 250 and 365nm; E2/E3) in permeate fractions were altered significantly during the early stages of TFF (CF<9). These changes, however, were not evident in excitation-emission matrix fluorescence properties as determined using the parallel factor analysis model. The application of AF4 to TFF fractions suggests that the choice of CF may have an important impact on the size distribution and aromaticity of permeate fractions, whereas fluorescence properties appear insensitive to concentration factor. These results suggest that the choice of CF is crucial only in the study of the permeate fraction where similar CF (i.e. >9) should be used to obtain meaningful comparison among samples.																	0306-7319	1029-0397				NOV 1	2013	93	13					1428	1440		10.1080/03067319.2013.764415						WOS:000327154500008

Complexation with dissolved organic matter and mobility control of heavy metals in the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The complexation of Zn, Cd and Pb with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) and a non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) of Sedum alfredii was measured using resin equilibration method. After the growth of HE S. alfredii, the rhizosphere soil pH was reduced by 0.27-0.33 units, due to enhanced DOM derived from root exudation. For both ecotypes of S. alfredii, the fraction of free metal as a percentage of soluble metal varied from 22.1 to 42.5% for Zn2+, from 8.1 to 15.5% for Cd2+, and from 4.5 to 10.4% for Pb2+. Resin equilibration experiment results indicated that HE DOM had greater ability to form complexes with Zn, Cd and Pb than NHE DOM, Visual MINTEQ model gave excellent predictions of the complexation of Zn and Cd by DOM (R-2 > 0.97). DOM in the rhizosphere of HE S. alfredii could significantly increase metal mobility through the formation of soluble DOM-metal complexes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, organic carbon present in environmental dissolved organic matter (eDOM) constitutes the main carbon source in nature. Information on how natural organic carbon affects degradation of pollutants and micropollutants, in particular, is however poor. Linuron-degrading Variovorax sp. strains SRS16, WDL1, and PBLH6 and a triple-species bacterial consortium, from which WDL1 originated, were examined for their ability to degrade linuron at micropollutant concentrations and the effect hereon of different eDOM formulations of varying biodegradability as supplementary C-source was explored. Individual strains and the consortium degraded linuron at initial concentrations as low as 1 mu g L-1 till concentrations below 4 ng L-1. Degradation kinetics differed among strains with rates that differed up to 70-fold at the lowest linuron concentrations and with lag phases ranging from 0 to 7 days. Linuron biodegradation by the individual strains was inhibited by an easily biodegradable compound such as citrate but stimulated by eDOM at a linuron concentration of 10 mg L-1. Effects were strongly reduced or became non-existent at micropollutant linuron concentrations. Effects of eDOM on degradation at 10 mg L-1 linuron by WDL1 were reduced when WDL1 was incubated together with its original consortium members. This is the first report on eDOM effects on degradation of pesticides at micropollutant concentrations and indicates these effects are limited and depend on linuron and eDOM concentrations, eDOM quality, and the bacterial culture.																	0175-7598	1432-0614				NOV	2013	97	22					9837	9846		10.1007/s00253-013-4690-7						WOS:000326394000023	23339013

Peak T (a tyrosine/tryptophan-like FDOM) did not show correlations to peak M or C which were humic-like substances, while a positive correlation (r=0.935, p<0.001) was present between the natural log-transformed maximum fluorescence intensity (F-max) of peaks T and M indicating a tight link during their production and processing. F-max values (in Raman unit nm(-1)) normalized to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were low, varying in ranges 15.93-85.95, 29.83-83.54 and 19.73-51.05 x 10(-5) nm(-1) (mu mol/L)(-1) for peaks T, M and C, respectively, in line with the history of strong photobleaching of the water samples as indicated by fairly high absorption spectral slope ratios (0.75-1.53 with a mean 1.03). Intermediate fluorescence index (FI) (1.46-1.83 with a mean 1.61) and small specific absorption at 254 nm (0.64-1.93 with a mean 1.15 m(-1) mg(-1) L) of the water samples, indicated the presence of both aquatic microbial DOM (e.g. peak T) and soil DOM (e.g. peak C). Peak C could be substantially removed by UV-A (320-400 nm) irradiation, while peak M was slightly increased when a microbe-containing water was exposed to the same UV-A irradiation. Taken together, peak C was attributed to diffuse soil source while peak M was likely attributed to joint effects of microbial activities and solar irradiation on the chromophores in the sample.

Watershed-derived allochthonous (WDA) and phytoplankton-derived autochthonous (PDA) CDOM were exposed to 9 days of natural solar radiation to assess the photobleaching response of different CDOM sources, using absorption and fluorescence (excitation-emission matrix) spectroscopy. Our results showed a marked decrease in total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration under natural sunlight exposure for both WDA and PDA CDOM, indicating photoproduction of ammonium from TDN. In contrast, photobleaching caused a marked increase in total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentration for both WDA and PDA CDOM. Thus TDN: TDP ratios decreased significantly both for WDA and PDA CDOM, which partially explained the seasonal dynamic of TDN: TDP ratio in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching rate of CDOM absorption a(254), was 0.032 m/MJ for WDA CDOM and 0.051 m/MJ for PDA CDOM from days 0-9, indicating that phototransformations were initially more rapid for the newly produced CDOM from phytoplankton than for the river CDOM. Extrapolation of these values to the field indicated that 3.9%-5.1% CDOM at the water surface was photobleached and mineralized every day in summer in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching caused the increase of spectral slope, spectral slope ratio and molecular size, indicating the CDOM mean molecular weight decrease which was favorable to further microbial degradation of mineralization. Three fluorescent components were validated in parallel factor analysis models calculated separately for WDA and PDA CDOM. Our study suggests that the humic-like fluorescence materials could be rapidly and easily photobleached for WDA and PDA CDOM, but the protein-like fluorescence materials was not photobleached and even increased from the transformation of the humic-like fluorescence substance to the protein-like fluorescence substance. Photobleaching was an important driver of CDOM and nutrients biogeochemistry in lake water.

Production of Photo-oxidants by Dissolved Organic Matter During UV Water Treatment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) irradiated by sunlight generates photo-oxidants that can accelerate organic contaminant degradation in surface waters. However, the significance of this process to contaminant removal during engineered UV water treatment has not been demonstrated, partly due to a lack of suitable methods in the deep UV range. This work expands methods previously established to detect O-1(2), HO center dot, H2O2, and DOM triplet states ((DOM)-D-3*) at solar wavelengths to irradiation at 254 nm, typical of UV water treatment. For transient intermediates, the methods include a photostable probe combined with selective scavengers. Quantum yields for O-1(2), (DOM)-D-3* and H2O2 were in the same range as for solar-driven reactions but were an order of magnitude higher for HO center dot, which other experiments indicate is due to H2O2 reduction. With the quantum yields, the degradation of metoxuron was successfully predicted in a DOM solution irradiated at 254 nm. Further modeling showed that the contribution of DOM sensitization to organic contaminant removal during UV treatment should be significant only at high UV fluence, characteristic of advanced oxidation processes. Of the reactive species studied, (DOM)-D-3* is predicted to have the greatest general influence on UV degradation of contaminants.

The results indicated that DOM in pore water of Yangtze estuary was very variable which mainly composed of low aromaticity and molecular weight materials. Three humic-like substances (C1, C2, C4) and one protein-like substance (C3) were identified by PARAFAC model. C1, C2 and C4 exhibited same trends and were very similar. The separation of samples on both axes of the PCA showed the difference in DOM properties. C1, C2 and C4 concurrently showed higher positive factor 1 loadings, while C3 showed highly positive factor 2 loadings. The PCA analysis showed a combination contribution of microbial DOM signal and terrestrial DOM signal in the Yangtze estuary. Higher and more variable DOM abundance, aromaticity and molecular weight of surface sediment pore water DOM can be found in the southern nearshore than the other regions primarily due to the influence of frequent and intensive human activities and tributaries inflow in this area. The DOM abundance, aromaticity, molecular weight and fluorescence intensity in core of different depth were relative constant and increased gradually with depth. DOM in core was mainly composed of humic-like material, which was due to higher release of the sedimentary organic material into the porewater during early diagenesis.

The resulting changes in DOM, such as its optical properties have been measured to follow the oxidation processes. However, such measurements contain only limited information on the changes in the oxidation states of and the reactive moieties in the DOM. In this study, we used mediated electrochemical oxidation to quantify changes in the electron donating capacities (EDCs), and hence the redox states, of three different types of DOM during oxidation with chlorine dioxide (ClO2), chlorine (as HOCl/OCl-), and ozone (O-3). Treatment with ClO2 and HOCl resulted in comparable and prominent decreases in EDCs, while the UV light absorbances of the DOM decreased only slightly. Conversely, ozonation resulted in only small decreases of the EDCs but pronounced absorbance losses of the DOM. These results suggest that ClO2 and HOCl primarily reacted as oxidants by accepting electrons from electron-rich phenolic and hydroquinone moieties in the DOM, while O-3 reacted via electrophilic addition to aromatic moieties, followed by ring cleavage. This study highlights the potential of combined EDC-UV measurements to monitor chemical oxidation of DOM, to assess the nature of the reactive moieties and to study the underlying reaction pathways.

While terrestrially derived HDOM reference materials distributed by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) have been readily available to engineering and scientific communities, a microbially derived reference HDOM was not, despite the well-characterized differences in the chemistry and reactivity of HDOM derived from terrestrial versus microbial sources. To address this gap, we collected a microbial reference fulvic acid from Pony Lake (PLFA) for distribution through the IHSS. Pony Lake is a saline coastal pond on Ross Island, Antarctica, where the landscape is devoid of terrestrial plants. Sample collection occurred over a 17-day period in the summer season at Pony Lake. During this time, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations increased nearly two-fold, and the fulvic acid fraction (collected using the XAD-8 method) accounted for 14.6% of the DOC. During the re-concentration and desalting procedures we isolated two other chemically distinct fulvic acid fractions: (1) PLFA-2, which was high in carbohydrates and (2) PLFA-CER, which was high in nitrogen. The chemical characteristics (elemental analysis, optical characterization with UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and C-13 NMR spectroscopy) of the three fulvic acid fractions helped to explain their behavior during isolation.

J	Hassan, W				Hassan, Waseem			C and N mineralization and dissolved organic matter potentials of two contrasting plant residues: effects of residue type, moisture, and temperature	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE												Predicting carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization of plant residues returned to soils is vital for foreseeing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere and soil nitrogen availability. Similarly, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important factor in forecasting microbial degradation of organic inputs as it represents the most active organic fraction, both biologically and chemically. In this study, an incubation experiment was conducted to investigate C and N mineralization and DOM potentials of residues of peanut (green manure, GM) and rice (rice straw, RS) at moisture regimes 50% (W1) and 100% (W2) of water holding capacity and temperature T1 (25 degrees C) and T2 (35 degrees C). The incorporation of plant residues significantly (P < 0.05) increased the mineralization and DOM, compared to controls. We observed that though GM residue had high carbon and nitrogen and DOM potential, but because of low C:N ratio and lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses compounds were vulnerable to easy decomposition with the increase in temperature, which led to more CO2 emission, fast mineralization, and less net OM in the soil. Conversely, RS residue, due to high C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses compounds was resistant to decompose with the increase in temperature and possessed slow mineralization and eventually low CO2 emission. The moisture regimes (W1 and W2) and temperature (T1 and T2) had significant (P < 0.05) effect on mineralization and DOM potentials of both plant residues. The significant decrease and increase in the mineralization and DOM potential of both plant residues was observed with the increase in moisture and temperature. Our results suggest that plant residues with high C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses compounds like RS are resistant to decompose with the increase in temperature, as a result possessed slow decomposition and mineralization, and can be used as an eco-friendly organic amendment, to get enduring benefits, and to mitigate the problem of carbon losses and CO2 emission from soil to atmosphere.																	0906-4710	1651-1913				OCT 1	2013	63	7					642	652		10.1080/09064710.2013.846398						WOS:000328317100009

Influence of dissolved organic matter character on mercury incorporation by planktonic organisms: An experimental study using oligotrophic water from Patagonian lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Ligands present in dissolved organic matter (DOM) form complexes with inorganic divalent mercury (Hg2+) affecting its bioavailability in pelagic food webs. This investigation addresses the influence of a natural gradient of DOM present in Patagonian lakes on the bioaccumulation of Hg2+ (the prevailing mercury species in the water column of these lakes) by the algae Cryptomonas erosa and the zooplankters Brachionus calyciflorus and Boeckella antiqua. Hg2+ accumulation was studied through laboratory experiments using natural water of four oligotrophic Patagonian lakes amended with(197)Hg(2+). The bioavailability of Hg2+ was affected by the concentration and character of DOM. The entrance of Hg2+ into pelagic food webs occurs mostly through passive and active accumulation. The incorporation of Hg2+ by Cryptomonas, up to 27% of the Hg2+ amended, was found to be rapid and dominated by passive adsorption, and was greatest when low molecular weight compounds with protein-like or small phenolic signatures prevailed in the DOM. Conversely, high molecular weight compounds with a humic or fulvic signature kept Hg2+ in the dissolved phase, resulting in the lowest Hg2+ accumulation in this algae. In Brachionus and Boeckella the direct incorporation of Hg from the aqueous phase was up to 3% of the Hg2+ amended. The dietary incorporation of Hg2+ by Boeckella exceeded the direct absorption of this metal in natural water, and was remarkably similar to the Hg2+ adsorbed in their prey. Overall, DOM concentration and character affected the adsorption of Hg2+ by algae through competitive binding, while the incorporation of Hg2+ into the zooplankton was dominated by trophic or dietary transfer.																	1001-0742	1878-7320				OCT 1	2013	25	10					1980	1991		10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60281-2						WOS:000326994000004	24494484

Electrochemical methods were first employed to evaluate DOM redox properties, and spectroscopic approaches were utilized to obtain information concerning its composition and structure. DOM was extracted from a forest soil profile with five horizons. Differential pulse voltammetry indicated that there were more redox-active moieties in the DOM from upper horizons than in that from lower horizons. Cyclic voltammetry further showed that these moieties were reversible in electron transfer. Chronoamperometry was employed to quantify the electron transfer capacity of DOM, including electron acceptor capacity and electron donor capacity, both of which decreased sharply with increasing depth. FT-IR, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectra results suggested that DOM from the upper horizons was enriched with aromatic and humic structures while that from the lower horizons was rich in aliphatic carbon, which supported the findings obtained by electrochemical approaches. Electrochemical approaches combined with spectroscopic methods were applied to evaluate the characteristics of DOM extracted along a forest soil profile. The electrochemical properties of DOM, which can be rapidly and simply obtained, provide insight into the migration and transformation of DOM along a soil profile and will aid in better understanding of the biogeochemical role of DOM in natural environments.				yuan, yong/B-1042-2010													1001-0742	1878-7320				OCT 1	2013	25	10					2093	2101		10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60283-6						WOS:000326994000017	24494497

Fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the continental shelf waters of western Bay of Bengal	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) of southwestern Bay of Bengal surface water during southwest monsoon consisted five fluorophores, three humic-like and two protein-like. The humification index (HIX) and humic fluorophores, viz., visible (C), marine (M) and UV (A) humic-likes indicated, better than biogeochemical constituents analyzed, that the northern-half region of the study area which is closer to the head bay (less salinity) is distinctly more terrestrially influenced. Similarly, the southern-half region (less dissolved oxygen) is indicated as more in situ influenced. This region is enriched with tyrosine protein-like fluorophore (B), an indicator of bacterial metabolism in some of its samples due to upwelled water. Although chlorophyll a is less in this (southern) region, the fluorescence based biological index (BIX) which is an index of recent phytoplankton production is about the same in the two regions, and the lower chlorophyll a of southern region is attributed to greater grazing pressure. Fluorescence properties, e.g., BIX are more informative about phytoplankton production than chlorophyll a.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				OCT	2013	122	5					1325	1334		10.1007/s12040-013-0349-0						WOS:000325816800014		
J	Chen, M; Maie, N; Parish, K; Jaffe, R				Chen, Meilian; Maie, Nagamitsu; Parish, Kathleen; Jaffe, Rudolf			Spatial and temporal variability of dissolved organic matter quantity and composition in an oligotrophic subtropical coastal wetland	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an essential component of the carbon cycle and a critical driver in controlling variety of biogeochemical and ecological processes in wetlands. The quality of this DOM as it relates to composition and reactivity is directly related to its sources and may vary on temporal and spatial scales. However, large scale, long-term studies of DOM dynamics in wetlands are still scarce in the literature. Here we present a multi-year DOM characterization study for monthly surface water samples collected at 14 sampling stations along two transects within the greater Everglades, a subtropical, oligotrophic, coastal freshwater wetland-mangrove-estuarine ecosystem. In an attempt to assess quantitative and qualitative variations of DOM on both spatial and temporal scales, we determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) values and DOM optical properties, respectively. DOM quality was assessed using, excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Variations of the PARAFAC components abundance and composition were clearly observed on spatial and seasonal scales. Dry versus wet season DOC concentrations were affected by dry-down and re-wetting processes in the freshwater marshes, while DOM compositional features were controlled by soil and higher plant versus periphyton sources respectively. Peat-soil based freshwater marsh sites could be clearly differentiated from marl-soil based sites based on EEM-PARAFAC data. Freshwater marsh DOM was enriched in higher plant and soil-derived humic-like compounds, compared to estuarine sites which were more controlled by algae- and microbial-derived inputs. DOM from fringe mangrove sites could be differentiated between tidally influenced sites and sites exposed to long inundation periods. As such coastal estuarine sites were significantly controlled by hydrology, while DOM dynamics in Florida Bay were seasonally driven by both primary productivity and hydrology. This study exemplifies the application of long term optical properties monitoring as an effective technique to investigate DOM dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. The work presented here also serves as a pre-restoration condition dataset for DOM in the context of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).

C, H, N, and P in ground dry leaves and C, N, and P in DOM of the species were determined, and C/N, C/P, C/H, DOC/C, TDN/N, TDP/P, DOC/TDN, and DOC/TDP were calculated. Chemical structures of the DOM were characterized by the use of multiple techniques including UV-visible, FT-IR, and C-13 CP/MAS spectra. The results showed subtle differences in quantity and quality of DOM among species and life-forms. Except oriental pepper which had a C/H of 0.7, C/H of all the other species was 0.6. C/N and C/P of ground leaves was 10.5-17.3 and 79.4-225.3, respectively, which were greater in floating and submerged species than in the others. Parrot feather also had a small C/P (102.8). DOC/C, TDN/N, and TDP/P were 7.6-16.8, 5.5-22.6, and 22.9-45.6 %, respectively. Except C/N in emergent and riparian species, C/N in the other species and C/P in all the species were lower in their DOM than in the ground leaves. DOM of the macrophytes had a SUVA(254) value of 0.83-1.80. The FT-IR and C-13 NMR spectra indicated that the DOM mainly contained polysaccharides and/or amino acids/proteins. Percent of carbohydrates in the DOM was 37.3-66.5 % and was highest in parrot feather (66.5 %) and crofton weed (61.5 %). DOM of water hyacinth, water lettuce, and sago pondweed may have the greatest content of proteins. Aromaticity of the DOM was from 6.9 % in water lettuce to 17.8 % in oriental pepper. DOM of the macrophytes was also different in polarity and percent of Ar-OH. Distinguished characteristics in quantity and quality of the macrophyte-derived DOM may induce unique environmental consequences in the lake systems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2013	20	10					7413	7423		10.1007/s11356-013-1761-3						WOS:000324815100068	23666633

However, responses of natural plankton communities especially in the open ocean to higher CO2 levels have not been fully examined. We conducted CO2 manipulation experiments in the Bering Sea and the central subarctic Pacific, known as high nutrient and low chlorophyll regions, in summer 2007 to investigate the response of organic matter production in iron-deficient plankton communities to CO2 increases. During the 14-day incubations of surface waters with natural plankton assemblages in microcosms under multiple pCO(2) levels, the dynamics of particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PN), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phosphorus (DOP) were examined with the plankton community compositions. In the Bering site, net production of POC, PN, and DOP relative to net chlorophyll-a production decreased with increasing pCO(2). While net produced POC:PN did not show any CO2-related variations, net produced DOC:DOP increased with increasing pCO(2). On the other hand, no apparent trends for these parameters were observed in the Pacific site. The contrasting results observed were probably due to the different plankton community compositions between the two sites, with plankton biomass dominated by large-sized diatoms in the Bering Sea versus ultra-eukaryotes in the Pacific Ocean. We conclude that the quantity and quality of the production of particulate and dissolved organic matter may be altered under future elevated CO2 environments in some iron-deficient ecosystems, while the impacts may be negligible in some systems.

Photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter from streams in the western Lake Superior watershed	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The input and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) can have important consequences for coastal zone productivity in large lakes and oceans. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM) is often delivered to coastal zones from rivers and streams and affects light penetration in a water column. CDOM can protect biota from damaging ultraviolet (UV) light by acting as sunscreen, resulting in increased ecosystem productivity. Alternatively, CDOM can decrease ecosystem productivity by absorbing light needed for photosynthesis and forming photoreaction products that are harmful to coastal zone biota. Increased urbanization of watersheds and seasonal differences in weather patterns change the delivery pathways, reactivity, input, and energy flow of DOM (and its CDOM component) into aquatic systems. This study investigated the effects of watershed and season on the concentrations and potential photodegradation of stream-derived DOM in Lake Superior tributaries, chosen to be geographically and geologically similar but differing in land use. Organic carbon analysis, UV-Visible spectrophotometry, and terrestrial (land use) analysis were used to investigate differences among samples and sample treatments. The major differences in DOM concentration and photochemical response appeared seasonal rather than site specific, with snow-melt samples showing stronger and more consistent changes in UV-Visible parameters while base-flow samples showed stronger and more consistent losses in DOC.																	1015-1621					OCT	2013	75	4					509	522		10.1007/s00027-013-0296-5						WOS:000324577500004

Uncertainty analysis of remote sensing of colored dissolved organic matter: Evaluations and comparisons for three rivers in North America	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												The uncertainties involved in remote sensing inversion of CDOM (Colored Dissolved Organic Matter) were analyzed in estuarine and coastal regions of three North American rivers: Mississippi, Hudson, and Neponset. Water optical and biogeochemical properties, including CDOM absorption and above-surface spectra, were collected in very high resolution. CDOM's concentrations (a(g)(440), absorption coefficient at 440 nm) were inverted from EO-1 Hyperion images, using a quasi-analytical algorithm for CDOM (QAA-CDOM). Uncertainties are classified to five levels, in which the underwater measurement uncertainty (level 1), image preprocessing uncertainty (level 4) and inverse model uncertainty (level 5) were evaluated. Results indicate that at level 1, in situ CDOM measurement is significant with 0.1 in the unit of QSU and 0.01 in the unit of a(g)(440) (m(-1)). At level 4, surface wave is a potential uncertainty source for high-resolution images in estuarine and coastal regions. The remote sensing reflectance of wavy water is about 10 times of the truth. At level 5, the overall uncertainty of QAA-CDOM inversion is 0.006 m(-1), with accuracy R-2 = 0.77, k = 1.1 and RMSElog = 0.33 m(-1). The correlations between uncertainties and other water properties indicate that the large uncertainty in some rivers, such as the Neponset and Atchafalaya, might be caused by high-concentration chlorophyll or sediments. The relationships among the three level uncertainties show that the level 1 uncertainty generally does not propagate into level 4 and 5, but the large uncertainty at level 4 usually introduce large uncertainty at level 5.

In this study, we took soil samples from 20 sites differing in land use (forest and agriculture) to investigate the electron transfer capacity of soil DOM and its potential relationship with soil respiration. DOM was extracted from 20 soil samples representing different land uses: forest (nos. 1-12) and agriculture (nos. 13-20) in Guangdong Province, China. Chronoamperometry was employed to quantify the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of the DOM, including electron acceptor capacity (EAC) and electron donor capacity (EDC), by applying fixed positive or negative potentials to a working electrode in a conventional three-electrode cell. The reversibility of electron accepting from or donating to DOM was measured by applying switchable potentials to the working electrode in the electrochemical system with the multiple-step potential technique. Carbon dioxide produced by soil respiration was measured with a gas chromatograph. Forest soil DOM samples showed higher ETC and electron reversible rate (ERR) than agricultural soil DOM samples, which may be indicative of higher humification rate and microbial activity in forest soils. The average soil respiration of forest soil (nos. 1-12) and agricultural soil (nos. 13-10) was 26.34 and 18.58 mg C g(-1) SOC, respectively. Both EDC and EAC of soil DOM had close relationship with soil respiration (p < 0.01). The results implied that soil respiration might be accelerated by the electroactive moieties contained in soil DOM, which serve as electron shuttles and facilitate electron transfer reactions in soil respiration and SOC mineralization. DOM of forest soils showed higher ETC and ERR than DOM of agricultural soils. As soil represents one of the largest reservoirs of organic carbon, soil respiration affects C cycle and subsequently CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. As one of the important characteristics of soil DOM related to soil respiration, ETC has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emission and soil carbon sequestration but has not been paid attention to.				yuan, yong/B-1042-2010													1439-0108					OCT	2013	13	9					1553	1560		10.1007/s11368-013-0748-5						WOS:000324498300003

We hypothesized that nematode C-13 label assimilation resulted from either direct DOM uptake or feeding on C-13 labeled bacteria. Slope sediments were injected with glucose ("simple" DOM) or "complex" diatom-derived DOM to investigate the influence of DOM composition on carbon assimilation. The time-series (1, 7 and 14 days) experiment at the seamount site was the first study to reveal a higher C-13 enrichment of nematodes than bacteria and sediments after 7 days. Although isotope dynamics indicated that both DOM and bacteria were plausible candidate food sources, the contribution to nematode secondary production and metabolic requirements (estimated from biomass-dependent respiration rates) was higher for bacteria than for DOM at all sites. The seamount nematode community showed higher carbon assimilation rates than the slope assemblages, which may reflect an adaptation to the food-poor environment. Our results suggested that the trophic importance of bacteria did not depend on the amount of labile sedimentary organic matter. Furthermore, there was a discrepancy between carbon assimilation rates observed in the experiments and the feeding type classification, based on buccal morphology. Sites with a similar feeding type composition (i.e. the northeast Atlantic sites) showed large differences in uptake, whilst the nematode assemblages at the two slope sites, which had a differing trophic structure, took up similar amounts of the DOM associated carbon. Our results did not indicate substantial differences in carbon processing related to the complexity of the DOM substrate. The quantity of processed carbon (5-42% of added DOM) was determined by the bacteria, and was primarily respired. The bulk of the added C-13-DOM was not ingested by the benthic biota under study, and a considerable fraction was possibly adsorbed onto the sediment grains. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Mineralisation of dissolved organic matter by heterotrophic stream biofilm communities in a large boreal catchment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Boreal headwater streams typically receive large contributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from wetland and forest soils and can exhibit high CO2 effluxes, but little is known about how stream biofilm respiration of DOM responds to carbon and nutrient substrates in boreal catchments. 2. The aim of this study was to assess (i) the response of heterotrophic biofilms to increased availability of labile carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and (ii) how this response varies across sites differing in the source of catchment organic matter. 3. Normalised biofilm respiration rates (R-Biofilm) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of DOM sources derived from wetland, deciduous forest and ponds were up to 10 times greater than for coniferous forest DOM. Experimental additions of bog- and pond-derived DOM stimulated R-Biofilm in coniferous forest sites (1.5-2.5 times), adding further weight to the evidence for differing responses to stream DOM sources in this boreal catchment. 4. Mineralisation of added glucose by the biofilms was only increased by added N and P, coinciding with a reduction in mineralisation of the extant stream DOM. These findings suggest that increases in labile C, N and P can reduce biofilm mineralisation of stream dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus, perhaps due to the greater energy required to access the more complex DOM. 5. In 15 of 19 experiments, the addition of glucose had no effect on biofilm mineralisation of stream DOC (R-DOC). In the presence of added N and P, however, R-DOC decreased by 30 to 38% with the addition of glucose at sites with the most active biofilms in summer. When glucose was added alone, conversely, R-DOC was stimulated (40-50%) at these same sites in autumn, when biofilm respiration was lower and DOM more aromatic and less carbohydrate-rich. Combined, these results suggest labile C sources, such as algal exudates, may (i) compete as a source of energy and/or stimulate the incorporation rather than mineralisation of the more N- and P-rich stream DOM or (ii) stimulate the mineralisation of stream DOM, potentially depending upon nutrient availability and the composition of stream DOM.

J	Yan, MQ; Fu, QW; Li, DC; Gao, GF; Wang, DS				Yan, Mingquan; Fu, Qiangwei; Li, Dechao; Gao, Gunfa; Wang, Dongsheng			Study of the pH influence on the optical properties of dissolved organic matter using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis	JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE												This study investigated the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) using the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) method combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. The examined DOM samples included Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and Nordic Reservoir natural organic matter (NRNOM). The optical properties of the DOM were determined from the behavior of individual groups of DOM fluorophores responding to different ionization states. The PARAFAC examination revealed that there were six independent EEM components in the SRFA that behaved differently in terms of pH influence on their fluorescence intensity. The dominant EEM peak locations (lambda(ex)/lambda(em)) of these components were (230, 330) nm/420 nm (Component 1), (250, 350) nm/450 nm (Component 2), (240, 340) nm/460 nm (Component 3), (220, 280) nm/380 nm (Component 4), (270, 400) nm/490 nm (Component 5), and (280, 340) nm/540 nm (Component 6). However, only four EEM components were observed in the NRNOM, which are similar to Components 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the SRFA. It can be speculated that Components 1, 2, 3 and 6 can be categorized as traditional terrestrial humic-like chromophores, while they are composed of different fractions of carboxylic-like and phenolic-like chromophores; Component 4 can be categorized as protein-like fluorophores primarily composed of carboxylic-like chromophores, and Component 5 can be categorized as a microbial humic-like component that is overwhelmingly composed of phenolic-like fluorophores. The results demonstrated that PARAFAC analysis is a promising approach for characterizing the fine functions in DOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chang, HH; Wang, GS				Chang, Huihsien; Wang, Genshuh			Fractionation of nitrogen-enriched dissolved organic matter in water	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in water is associated with disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation especially for nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs), which possess stronger adverse health effects than traditional carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs). DON characteristics affect not only the amount but also the speciation of DBPs formation. To characterize DON constituents in water, this study modified and validated a DON fractionation method using DAX-8, XAD-4, and MSC-1H resins. The method was then used to investigate the characterization and composition of DON constituents in treated wastewater effluents and raw waters. From validation tests using nitrogenous surrogate solutions, recoveries of each pretreatment step as well as selected eluents and flow rates were acceptable for fractionation of aqueous DON. The absence of any statistically significant difference in DON compositions between duplicate treated effluents also validated the applicability of the modified fractionation method for field water. The proposed method will be useful for characterizing and evaluating the properties, amounts, and compositions of DON-enriched materials in water and help address the current lack of information on DON profiles in water sources.

Michael			Acid-base properties of dissolved organic matter from pristine and oil-impacted marshes of Barataria Bay, Louisiana	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Five samples of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were isolated from Barataria Bay, Louisiana using the coupled reverse osmosis/electrodialysis method. Two of the samples (BU) were isolated from relatively pristine waters and three samples (BC) were isolated from waters that were strongly impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April-July, 2010. The acid-base properties of these five samples were investigated by potentiometric titration. Carboxyl contents were estimated using an empirical pH-based method, and carboxyl contents, average pK(a)'s, and the range of plc in each sample were determined by fitting two numerical models (the Gaussian distribution model and the modified Henderson-Hasselbalch model) to the titration data. The carboxyl contents of the titrated samples range from 6.0 to 6.9 meg gC(-1) and the average pK(a)'s for carboxyl groups range from 4.0 to 4.6. The distribution of pK(a) values is somewhat broader for the BU samples than for the BC samples, but all other acid-base properties of the five samples were comparable. Phenolic hydroxyl groups could not be detected in any of the samples. These samples of coastal DOM are much less acidic than fulvic acids from soils and fresh waters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To examine the qualitative changes to DOM optical properties during photobleaching, 674 m N. Pacific DOM, concentrated and desalted by reverse osmosis with electrodialysis (RO/ED), was subjected to 68 days of continuous irradiation in a UV solar simulator. Approximately 84% of chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM respectively) and 38% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were lost during the irradiation. Based on these results the concentration of photochemically refractory DOC in the surface pacific is estimated to be 27 mu mol of carbon per liter. In addition, the spectra of the remaining CDOM and FDOM were shifted towards shorter wavelengths, a result which has important implications for the interpretation of fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra because the relative positions of fluorescence maxima are often attributed to differences in FDOM source. Qualitative indices derived from CDOM and FDOM spectra for the irradiated deep DOM sample resembled those for surface waters of the North Pacific Ocean indicating that photobleaching has a significant influence upon the optical properties of DOM in the open ocean.

Selective incorporation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during sea ice formation	MARINE CHEMISTRY												This study investigated the incorporation of DOM from seawater into <2 day-old sea ice in tanks filled with seawater alone or amended with DOM extracted from the microalga, Chlorella vulgaris. Optical properties, including chromophoric DOM (CDOM) absorption and fluorescence, as well as concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved carbohydrates (dCHOs) and dissolved uronic acids (dUAs) were measured. Enrichment factors (EFs), calculated from salinity-normalized concentrations of DOM in bulk ice, brine and frost flowers relative to under-ice water, were generally >1. The enrichment factors varied for different DOM fractions: EFs were the lowest for humic-like DOM (1.0-1.39) and highest for amino acid-like DOM (1.10-3.94). Enrichment was generally highest in frost flowers with there being less enrichment in bulk ice and brine. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that there was a shift towards smaller molecules in the molecular size distribution of DOM in the samples collected from newly formed ice compared to seawater. Spectral slope coefficients did not reveal any consistent differences between seawater and ice samples. We conclude that DOM is incorporated to sea ice relatively more than inorganic solutes during initial formation of sea ice and the degree of the enrichment depends on the chemical composition of DOM.

Roles of singlet oxygen and triplet excited state of dissolved organic matter formed by different organic matters in bacteriophage MS2 inactivation	WATER RESEARCH												Inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triplet excited state of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*) produced by irradiation of natural and synthetic sensitizers with simulated sunlight of wavelengths greater than 320 nm was investigated. Natural sensitizers included purified DOM isolates obtained from wastewater and river waters, and water samples collected from Singapore River, Stamford Canal, and Marina Bay Reservoir in Singapore. Linear correlations were found between MS2 inactivation rate constants (k(obs)) and the photo-induced reaction rate constants of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP), a probe compound shown to react mainly with (DOM)-D-3*. Linear correlations between MS2 k(obs) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) concentrations were also found for both purified DOM isolates and natural water samples. These correlations, along with data from quenching experiments and experiments with synthetic sensitizers, Rose Bengal (RB), 3'-methoxyacetophenone (3'-MAP), and nitrite (NO2-), suggest that 102, (DOM)-D-3*, and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) could inactivate bacteriophage MS2. Linear correlations between MS2 k(obs) and Specific Ultraviolet Absorption determined at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) were also found for both purified DOM isolates and natural samples. These results suggest the potential use of TMP as a chemical probe and SUVA(254) as an indicator for virus inactivation in natural and purified DOM water samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the spatial and temporal variations of DOM in the anthropogenically impacted Zhujiang River were investigated by analyzing the water samples in an upstream, urbanized area and downstream of the rivers on different days of one year. The results indicated that the levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) were unaffected by seasonal changes, but the specific UV254 absorbance (SUVA) values and the total nitrogen (TN) content were greater in the winter than those in the summer. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of the excitation emission matrices (EEM) revealed the presence of three anthropogenically derived components [tryptophan-like (C1) and tyrosine-like proteins (C3) and anthropogenic humic substances (C5)] in the urbanized rivers, and they had greater seasonal and spatial variability than the terrestrial and microbial humic substances (C2 and C4). Cluster analysis revealed that treated wastewater was an important source of DOM in the urbanized streams. Photodegradation experiments indicated that the DOM in the populous area of the rivers had greater photodegradation potentials than that in the downstream region or in the natural waters. Interestingly, that the anthropogenic humic substances (C5) were considerably more photoreactive than the other four PARAFAC components, which exhibited a decrease of 80% after exposure to sunlight for 0.5 d. This study suggests that the treated wastewater could be an important input to the DOM in the urbanized rivers and the naturally occurring photodegradation could help in eliminating the anthropogenic DOM during their transport.

J	Cortes-Francisco, N; Caixach, J				Cortes-Francisco, Nuria; Caixach, Josep			Molecular Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter through a Desalination Process by High Resolution Mass Spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The effect of different water treatments such as ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) on dissolved organic matter (DOM) is still unknown. Electrospray ionization Fourier transform orbitrap mass spectrometry has been used to provide valuable information of marine DOM evolution through a desalination process on a molecular scale. In the present manuscript, the characterization of four real composite water samples from a desalination pilot plant installed in the coast of Barcelona (Spain) has been carried out. The sampling was performed on each point of the pilot plant: raw seawater (RSW), UF effluent, brine RO and permeate RO. The mass spectra of the different samples show several thousand peaks, however for the present screening study, only the mass range m/z 200-500 and the main signals in this mass range (relative intensities >= 1%) have been considered. The analysis of RSW and UF samples reveal that there is little effect on DOM by the UF pilot. However, when the water is treated on the RO an important change on DOM has been observed. The recurring periodical patterns found in RSW and UF are lost in Permeate RO sample. Compounds with more aliphatic character, with higher H/C ratio (H/C-av 1.72) are present in the Permeate and some of them have been tentatively identified as fatty acids.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 3	2013	47	17					9619	9627		10.1021/es4000388						WOS:000330094700009	23879562

Treatment of these samples with sodium borodeuteride was shown to produce unique mass labels for species which contain one or two ketone/aldehyde moieties. Approximately 30% of all identified peaks in the two samples were shown to comprise ketone/aldehyde-containing species. The molecular formulas of the majority of these species had O/C and H/C molar ratios typically attributed to lignin-derived compounds and/or carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). However, the significant loss of UV-vis absorption following reduction supports a lignin-based origin for the optical (and photochemical) properties of these samples. The mass-labeling method described and tested herein shows great promise as a means to further characterize the structure and composition of complex natural samples, especially in terms of identifying specific subsets of chemical species that contribute significantly to the optical and photochemical properties of such samples.

The objective of this study was to examine the influence of DOM from corn straw on the sorption of Zn and Cu by loess through batch adsorption technique. The sorption isotherms of Zn and Cu could be well described by the Freundlich equation, and the partition distribution coefficient (k) in the presence of DOM was reduced by 86% for Zn and 58% for Cu, as compared to the control receiving no DOM, suggesting that DOM had a stronger inhibitory effect on Zn sorption than that of Cu. In addition, the sorption of metal increased with an increase in pH for loess, with maximum inhibition on metal sorption observed at pH > 7.6 for Zn and pH > 5.5 for Cu in the absence ofDOM but Cu sorption of DOM was suddenly decreased with an increase of pH at pH > 7.9 in the presence of DOM. At a DOM concentration of <200mg L-1, sorption of Zn and Cu was reduced by 46% for Zn and 32% for Cu with an increase in DOM concentration.																	0277-2248	1029-0486				SEP 1	2013	95	8					1318	1327		10.1080/02772248.2013.866238						WOS:000331929100007

Marine DOM was isolated by tangential ultrafiltration (UF) using two different polyethersulfone membranes exhibiting different molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), 3 and 10 kDa. The procedures require a volume of seawater sample of 100 L, and marine DOM of molecular weight higher than 3 and 10 kDa (UF membranes of 3 and 10 kDa MWCO) was pre-concentrated in 0.5 L (retentate), which implies a pre-concentration factor of 200. Retentate fractions obtained after the different UF procedures were further desalted by using HI Trap desalting mini-columns before two-dimensional SEC/AEC. Apparent molecular weights of isolated compounds after SEC with UV detection ranged from 1.5 kDa (close to the permeable volume of the SEC column fixed by injecting vitamin B12) to 16 and 22 kDa (UF membranes of 3 and 10 kDa MWCO, respectively). Further AEC/UV characterization of SEC fractions showed a large group of macromolecules eluted at 4.5 mm, and small signals at shorter retention times (2.5 and 3.5 mm). In addition, AEC experiments of the isolated SEC fractions when using 10 kDa MWCO UF membranes showed a group of substances eluted at high retention times (13 mm). SEC hyphenation with ICP-MS proved the existence of several trace elements (Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mo and Sr) bound to the isolated marine DOM. Mass balance studies after analyzing the retentate and permeate fractions for trace elements indicate good recoveries (close to 100%) for elements such as Mo, Sr, Ba and Zn when performing the UF with both 3 and 10 kDa MWCo membranes. However, recoveries from 36 to 81% were obtained for the remaining studied elements after either UF procedure. SEC-ICP-MS experiments showed percentages of metals bound to the isolated marine DOM ranging from 0.055 and 0.077% (Zn) to 4.1 10(-4) and 1.4 10(-4%) (Sr). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Surface water DOM samples were also investigated for comparison. Two humic-like components (C1 : 250, 355/472 nm; C2: < 240, 325/400 nm) and one protein-like component (C3: <240, 280/340 nm) were identified using parallel factor analysis. Low intensities for all components were observed in groundwater DOM from the upper and lower reaches of the study area. However, higher abundances of these components occurred in the middle reaches, reflecting the combined effect of seepage of surface water with strong anthropogenic pollution and the alteration of groundwater circulation due to cutoff as a result of the construction of a cutoff wall since the late 1990s. The humic-like components were dominant in groundwater DOM, with the average percentage of the protein-like component being only 15%, which was less than half of the corresponding percentage in surface water DOM. The freshness index in groundwater DOM was lower than the surface water samples, while the fluorescence index and humification index were higher than in the latter. These indices demonstrated the much higher degree of humification for groundwater DOM, which may be related to the longer residence time of groundwater and greater contribution of microbial degradation in the aquifer environment. This study demonstrated that EEMs could distinguish between the effects of natural background and human activities on the quantity and characteristics of the groundwater DOM, and thus could be a useful tool for studing the carbon dynamics and the controlling factors in groundwater systems.

Based on the experimental data from the batch system of the ASBF pilot plant, mathematical models for the plug-flow reactor were developed to predict dissolved organic matter and ammonia nitrogen removal rates as a function of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria populations, dissolved organic matter concentrations, ammonia nitrogen concentrations, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and temperature. The mathematical models for dissolved organic matter and ammonia nitrogen removal in ASBF include two differential equations reflecting heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria populations, and a number of kinetic parameters. Consequently, the results present a better insight into the dynamics behavior of heterotrophic and autotrophic biofilm growth and their practical application to wastewater for dissolved organic matter and ammonia nitrogen removal process. The mathematical model for ammonia nitrogen and dissolved organic matter removals present good results for the plug-flow reactor.																	1226-8372	1976-3816				SEP	2013	18	5					989	999		10.1007/s12257-012-0510-7						WOS:000326040600020

Impact of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) on Parameter Sensitivity of a Kinetic Ozone Decomposition Model	OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Ozone decomposition in real water is often empirically modeled due to the system complexity. Mechanistic models, however, can be of great value in view of engineering applications. The high number of model parameters often restricts their applicability. In this study, sensitivity analyses were used to determine the most important elementary reactions from a kinetic model and to understand the reaction mechanism. Only seven of the 28 rate constants showed to impact ozone and hydroxyl radical concentrations. Mass-transfer related parameters were of major importance. Ozone decomposition was extremely sensitive to parameters involving dissolved organic matter (DOM) at very low scavenger levels implying that even in ultrapure water systems impurities should be considered. To increase the applicability of mechanistic ozonation models, simplification of the elementary radical scheme combined with a more detailed description of reactions involving DOM is needed.

The 3D-EEMS spectrogram of soil samples had three main peaks : peak-A, related to humic acid-like (HA-like) material at an Ex/Em of 310-330/395-420 nm; peak-B, related to UV fulvic acid-like (FA-like) material at an Ex/Em of 230-280/400-435 nm; and peak-E, related to simple aromatic proteins at an Ex/Em of 210-240/290-340 nm. In comparison with the 3D-EEMS spectrogram of the basic soil samples, that of the soil samples with fertilization treatment indicated that the intensities of peak-A and peak-B were reduced and the intensity of peak-E was increased in middle-yielding fields and low-yielding fields. Furthermore, the fertilization treatment enhanced crops on the use of soil organic matter and improved the ability of soil to provide continuous fertility. The fertilization treatment mainly increased the fertility of the deep soil layer and promoted the decomposition and utilization of soil DOM. By comparing the r((A,B)) and f(450/500) values, it was found that with fertilization treatment promoted the degree of maturity of high-yielding and middle-yielding fields and that it increased the terrigenous DOM of high-yielding fields and biological source DOM of middle-yielding and low-yielding fields. Peak-A and peak-B were significantly and positively correlated to the content of DOC, DON, DOP, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen and corn yield. Soil fertility, microbial biomass and crop growth were found to be important factors that increased the fluorescence intensities of soil DOM.																	0972-3226					SEP	2013	14	3					716	728								WOS:000326008100015

Scott			Characterization of freshwater natural dissolved organic matter (DOM): Mechanistic explanations for protective effects against metal toxicity and direct effects on organisms	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) exerts direct and indirect influences on aquatic organisms. In order to better understand how DOM causes these effects, potentiometric titration was carried out for a wide range of autochthonous and terrigenous freshwater DOM isolates. The isolates were previously characterized by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. Proton binding constants (pK(a)) were grouped into three classes: acidic (pK(a) <= 5), intermediate (5 < pK(a) <= 8.5) and basic (pK(a) > 8.5). Generally, the proton site densities (L-T) showed maximum peaks at the acidic and basic ends around pK(a) values of 3.5 and 10, respectively. More variably positioned peaks occurred in the intermediate pK(a) range. The acid-base titrations revealed the dominance of carboxylic and phenolic ligands with a trend for more autochthonous sources to have higher total L-T. A summary parameter, referred to as the Proton Binding Index (PBI), was introduced to summarize chemical reactivity of DOMs based on the data of pK(a) and L-T. Then, the already published spectroscopic data were explored and the specific absorbance coefficient at 340 nm (i.e. SAC(340)), an index of DOM aromaticity, was found to exhibit a strong correlation with PBI. Thus, the tendencies observed in the literature that darker organic matter is more protective against metal toxicity and more effective in altering physiological processes in aquatic organisms can now be rationalized on a basis of chemical reactivity to protons.

In A(2)/O process, tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like materials were removed to the much greater extent than that of fulvic-like. The protein-like material might be mostly decomposed by anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in anaerobic/anoxic and oxic zones. C1, C2, I-276, I-286, AP(1) and AP(2) were much better in tracing variations of tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like materials than C3, I-329 and AF(1) in tracing fulvic-like. The number of sampling sites should be reduced, as concentration variations of DOM components were subtle among sampling sites in the oxic zone and secondary sedimentation tank. SDSF may be a useful tool as PARAFAC to monitor removal efficiency of DOM fractions from wastewater in the WWTP. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Anthropogenic pressures combined with climate disturbances such as hurricanes can affect the biogeochemistry of the region and threaten the health of this unique ecosystem. As such, water quality monitoring has historically been implemented in the Florida Keys, and six spatially distinct zones have been identified. In these studies however, dissolved organic matter (DOM) has only been studied as a quantitative parameter, and DOM composition can be a valuable biogeochemical parameter in assessing environmental change in coastal regions. Here we report the first data of its kind on the application of optical properties of DOM, in particular excitation emission matrix fluorescence with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), throughout these six Florida Keys regions in an attempt to assess spatial differences in DOM sources. Our data suggests that while DOM in the Florida Keys can be influenced by distant terrestrial environments such as the Everglades, spatial differences in DOM distribution were also controlled in part by local surface runoff/fringe mangroves, contributions from seasgrass communities, as well as the reefs and waters from the Florida Current. Application of principal component analysis (PCA) of the relative abundance of EEM-PARAFAC components allowed for a clear distinction between the sources of DOM (allochthonous vs. autochthonous), between different autochthonous sources and/or the diagenetic status of DOM, and further clarified contribution of terrestrial DOM in zones where levels of DOM were low in abundance. The combination between EEM-PARAFAC and PCA proved to be ideally suited to discern DOM composition and source differences in coastal zones with complex hydrology and multiple DOM sources.

J	Zhu, ZK; Tao, L; Li, FB				Zhu, Zhenke; Tao, Liang; Li, Fangbai			Effects of dissolved organic matter on adsorbed Fe(II) reactivity for the reduction of 2-nitrophenol in TiO2 suspensions	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is widespread in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Iron is the most abundant transition metal in the Earth's crust. The biogeochemistry of iron and the strength of Fe(II) as a reducing agent while adsorbed on minerals are affected by DOM. This study investigated the effects of Fe(II)/DOM interactions on the reduction of 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) in TiO2 suspensions. Kinetic measurements demonstrated that rates (k) of 2-NP reduction by adsorbed Fe(II) species are affected by adding DOM (denoted O-DOM), and the obtained k values under the impact of the Fe(II)/DOM interaction with different molecular weight DOM fractions [including MW < 3500 Da (L-DOM), 3500 < MW < 14 000 Da (M-DOM), and MW > 14 000 Da (H-DOM)] showed significant differences. The enhanced rates of 2-NP reduction contributed to increases in the amount of adsorbed Fe(II) species and negative shifts in peak oxidation potential values (Er) in CV tests. For different molecular weight DOM fractions, increases in k (O-DOM < L-DOM < M-DOM < H-DOM) are consistent with increases in molar electron transfer capacities (ETC) based on k values at a fixed DOM concentration (O-DOM < L-DOM < M-DOM < H-DOM). This study attributed the impact of DOM on the enhanced reductive reactivity of Fe(II) to the higher level of adsorbed Fe(II) and the lower E-P values. In addition, the ETC values were slightly higher in the TiO2 suspension containing the H-DOM fraction as compared the other two DOM fractions, which would further enhance the reduction rate of 2-NP. These findings promote a general understanding of Fe(II)/DOM interactions and their impact on the fate of contaminants in actual subsurface environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yang, F; Wang, M; Wang, ZY				Yang, Fen; Wang, Meng; Wang, Zunyao			Sorption behavior of 17 phthalic acid esters on three soils: Effects of pH and dissolved organic matter, sorption coefficient measurement and QSPR study	CHEMOSPHERE												This work studies the sorption behaviors of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) on three soils by batch equilibration experiments and quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) methodology. Firstly, the effects of soil type, dissolved organic matter and pH on the sorption of four PAEs (DMP, DEP, DAP, DBP) are investigated. The results indicate that the soil organic carbon content has a crucial influence on sorption progress. In addition, a negative correlation between pH values and the sorption capacities was found for these four PAEs. However, the effect of DOM on PAEs sorption may be more complicated. The sorption of four PAEs was promoted by low concentrations of DOM, while, in the case of high concentrations, the influence of DOM on the sorption was complicated. Then the organic carbon content normalized sorption coefficient (logK(oc)) values of 17 PAEs on three soils were measured, and the mean values ranged from 1.50 to 7.57. The logK(oc), values showed good correlation with the corresponding logK(ow) values. Finally, two QSPR models were developed with 13 theoretical parameters to get reliable logK(oc), predictions. The leave-one-out cross validation (CV-LOO) indicated that the internal predictive power of the two models was satisfactory. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Distinguishing dissolved organic matter at its origin: Size and optical properties of leaf-litter leachates	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was leached from eight distinct samples of leaves taken from six distinct trees (red maple, bur oak at three times of the year, two sugar maple and two white spruce trees from disparate soil types). Multiple samples were taken over 72-96 h of leaching. The size and optical properties of leachates were assessed using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled to diode-array ultraviolet/visible absorbance and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence detectors (EEM). The fluorescence of unfractionated samples was also analyzed. EEMs were analyzed using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and principal component analysis (PCA) of proportional component loadings. Both the unfractionated and AF4-fractionated leachates had distinct size and optical properties. The 95% confidence ranges for molecular weight distributions were determined as: 210-440 Da for spruce, 540920 Da for sugar maple, 630-800 Da for spring oak leaves, 930-950 Da for senescent oak, 1490-1670 for senescent red maple, and 3430-4270 Da for oak leaves that were collected from the ground after spring thaw. In most cases the fluorescence properties of leachates were different for individuals from different soil types and across seasons; however, PCA of PARAFAC loadings revealed that the observed distinctiveness was chiefly species-based. Strong correlations were found between the molecular weight distribution of both unfractionated and fractionated leachates and their principal component loadings (R-2 = 0.85 and 0.95, respectively). It is concluded that results support a species-based origin for differences in optical properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of the photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter on bacterial physiology and diversity in a coastal system	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The effect of solar radiation on dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the subsequent impact of photo-altered DOM on bacterial activity and community structure were assessed during two experiments in the coastal system of the Ria de Vigo (NW Iberian Peninsula). After exposure of 0.2 mu n filtered seawater for 3.5 days to dark and full sunlight, an inoculum of the bacterial community collected at the same time as the exposed water was added and the mixture was incubated for 4 days in the dark at 15 degrees C. Changes in bacterial production (BP), diversity (assessed by Fluorescence in situ hybridization) and electron transport system (ETS) activity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) and DOM humic-like absorption and fluorescence were followed. The exposure to sunlight had no effect on DOM concentrations while an average (+/- SD) decrease in DOM humic fluorescence of 45 +/- 10% was found. The incubations with photo-altered DOM had lower BP (57 +/- 11%), ETS (42 +/- 9%) and bacterial carbon demand (BCD) (42 +/- 8%) compared with the dark incubations, while bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was un-affected. This suggests that DOM photo-alteration had a negative effect on bacterial metabolism in the study system. The bacterial growth on irradiated DOM resulted in a significant enrichment of the Gammaproteobacteria group compared with the dark control, indicating that solar exposure of DOM led to rapid changes in the bacterial community composition of the Ria de Vigo.

J	Wada, S; Hama, T				Wada, Shigeki; Hama, Takeo			The contribution of macroalgae to the coastal dissolved organic matter pool	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in coastal environments has various origins; one of the most intensely studied sources is terrestrial DOM input via rivers. On the other hand, contributions from other significant DOM sources, such as macroalgae, to the coastal DOM pool have not been extensively studied. The present study quantified the contribution of macroalgae to the DOM pool in the coastal environment using, firstly, a bag-covering experiment on a brown alga, Ecklonia cava, and identifying fluorescent DOM components by parallel factor analysis of three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix spectra. Using the fluorescent DOM as an indicator, we evaluated the horizontal distribution of macroalgal DOM in the coastal area, showing that the fluorescent DOM component had a synchronous gradient with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations along the transect line from the coast to offshore. On the basis of the correlation between DOC and fluorescent DOM, we evaluated concentrations of DOC originating from macroalgae, accounting for up to 20% of total DOC concentrations. This implies that in contrast to previous studies, macroalgae do make a measurable contribution to the coastal DOM pool. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Allochthonous dissolved organic matter controls bacterial carbon production in old-growth and clearfelled headwater streams	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												We investigated how the source and composition of stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) influenced rates of benthic bacterial C production (BCP) in 20 forested, headwater streams in southern Tasmania. We also assessed whether the source and composition of stream DOM was influenced by clearfell forest harvesting (1-19 y after harvest). Stream DOM was dominated by humic- and fulvic-like fluorescence (86.3-95.5%) as measured by parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of DOM fluorescence. Several reach-scale environmental variables showed significant positive (leaf-area index, sediment total N, organic C) or negative (stream temperature) linear relationships with BCP. However, an increasing contribution of terrestrial DOM, as measured by a decreasing fluorescence index (FI), was the strongest variable driving in situ benthic BCP (R-2 = 0.38, p = 0.004, n = 20). Forest harvesting did not significantly affect DOM source despite the major reach-scale disturbance that clearfell forestry represents. Nevertheless, conflicting evidence was found for changes in DOM composition after harvesting. Catchment-scale processes probably are more important than reach-scale processes in determining stream DOM biogeochemistry because clearfelled areas are small relative to the total catchment area. Our results demonstrate that freshly leached, terrestrial DOM can influence stream ecosystem processes through the tight biogeochemical linkage that exists between forested, headwater streams and their surrounding terrestrial environment.

A model for remote estimation of ultraviolet absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter based on the global distribution of spectral slope	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV, 280-400 nm) by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) precedes a host of light-sensitized surface ocean processes relevant to global climate. These include photo- and biogeochemical cycling of organic material, release of sulfur and carbon-containing gases to the atmosphere, and the photoprotection of marine microorganisms. Synoptic CDOM absorption data in the UV is highly desired yet difficult to estimate by satellite methods as the atmosphere interferes with direct detection of water-leaving UV radiance. The absorption spectrum of CDOM is typically modeled as an exponential function in which a spectral slope parameter, S. describes the rate of decrease in absorption with increase in wavelength. Significant functional relationships are observed in aquatic environments between S and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 443 nm, a(CDOM)(443). In this paper, we use a large, systematic dataset of spectroscopic CDOM measurements from the U.S. CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography Survey to examine the relationship between S and a(CDOM)(443) as a means to model a(CDOM)(lambda) in the UV from ocean color. Our resultant model predicts a(CDOM)(lambda) at wavelengths from 325 to 412 nm from the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved and detrital materials (CDM) at 443 nm, a(CDM)(443), retrieved by an existing semi-analytical ocean color algorithm. Expected agreement (near 1:1) with the training dataset was achieved (r(2) = 0.71-0.85, p = 0, n = 127). Considering inherent satellite data uncertainties as well as the model's limitations in regions with potential terrestrial influence, good correspondence between modeled and in situ values was observed during independent validation with open ocean CDOM data, such as from BIOSOPE (r(2) p < 0.05, n = 29). The model has immediate application in global scale assessments of photochemical rate processes and CDOM cycling in the open ocean due to its simplicity and optimization using a large base of field data (>7500 samples) from diverse Case I waters.

The concentration and isolation of DOM from seawater by ultrafiltration facilitates its chemical characterization by spectroscopic techniques. Using ultrafiltration, silver cation preparative chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we identified 50 novel sugar compounds after hydrolysis of the high molecular weight dissolved organic matter fraction (HMWDOM; the fraction of DOM isolated after ultrafiltration). Sugars were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of chemically synthetized standards and with spectra previously described in the literature. Our results showed that mono- and di-methylated hexoses; mono- and di-methylated pentoses; mono- and di-methylated 6-deoxysugars, as well as heptoses, methylated heptoses, 3,6-dideoxysugars and 1,6 anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan) are components of HMWDOM, which may explain the low apparent yields of sugars recovered by molecular level (HPLC) analyses of HMWDOM after hydrolysis. From three depths spanning the surface (15 m) to bathypelagic (1800 m) ocean in the North Pacific near Hawaii our results showed that mono- and di-methylated hexoses were most abundant in the surface sample (64% of the total identified methylated sugar compounds), while at 1800 m monomethylated 6-deoxysugars were the dominant sugars (42% of the total identified methylated sugar compounds). The high diversity of mono- and di-methylated hexoses in the surface sample most likely suggests an algal and/or bacterial source, while the high abundance of methylated 6-deoxy hexoses in the deep sample points toward an important bacterial contribution because the latter sugars are mostly found in bacterial lipopolysaccharides as well as highly degraded organic material.

Using a multiproxy approach incorporating electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR), stable carbon isotope analysis, and excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate the unique composition of marine-derived organic matter in Atlantic hurricane rainwater. Hurricane Irene rainwater DOM (DOMIrene) was molecularly distinct from that of the terrestrial squall (DOMsquall). For example, delta C-13(DOC) of Irene rainwater was -19.2 +/- 0.13 parts per thousand while that of the squall was -26.3 +/- 0.01 parts per thousand. Peaks assigned using FTICR which were unique to DOMIrene contained a greater relative number of molecular formulas containing nitrogen (representing any of several isomeric CHON, CHONS, CHONP compounds) relative to those unique to the DOMsquall. Although there was insufficient rainwater available to test DOMsquall for its bioavailability, a simple room-temperature incubation of Irene rainwater over 30 days in the dark resulted in its dissolved organic carbon decreasing from 2.3 to 1.5 mg L-1. When coupled with the abundant precipitation generally-associated with hurricanes, these results suggest that marine DOM in rainwater may exert unique but substantial impacts to organic matter in coastal aquatic ecosystems.

J	Le, CF; Hu, CM				Le, Chengfeng; Hu, Chuanmin			A hybrid approach to estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter in turbid estuaries from satellite measurements: A case study for Tampa Bay	OPTICS EXPRESS												Remote sensing of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from satellite measurements for estuaries has been problematic due to optical complexity of estuarine waters and uncertainties in satellite-derived remote sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr(-1)). Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach to combine empirical and semi-analytical algorithms to derive CDOM absorption coefficient at 443 nm (a(g)(443), m(-1)) in a turbid estuary (Tampa Bay) from MODIS Aqua (MODISA) and SeaWiFS measurements. The approach first used a validated empirical algorithm and a modified quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) to derive chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla, mg m(-3)) and particulate backscattering coefficient at 443 nm (b(bp)(443), m(-1)), respectively, from which phytoplankton pigment and non-algal particulate absorption coefficient at 443 nm (a(ph)(443) and a(d)(443), m(-1)) were derived with pre-determined bio-optical relationships. Then, the modified QAA was used to estimate the total absorption coefficient at 443 nm (a(t)(443), m(-1)). Finally, a(g)(443) was estimated as (a(t)(443) - a(ph)(443) - a(d)(443) - a(w)(443)) where a(w)(443) is the absorption coefficient of pure water (a constant). Using data collected from 71 field stations and 33 near-concurrent satellite-field matchup data pairs covering a large dynamic range (0.3 - 8 m(-1)), the approach showed similar to 23% RMS uncertainties in retrieving a(g)(443) when in situ Rrs data (N = 71) were used. The same approach applied to satellite Rrs yielded much higher uncertainties of a(g)(443) (similar to 85%) due to large errors in the satellite-retrieved Rrs(443). When the Rrs(443) was derived from the satellite-retrieved Rrs(550) and then used in the hybrid approach, uncertainties in the retrieved a(g)(443) reduced to similar to 30% (N = 33). Application of the approach to MODISA and SeaWiFS data led to a 15-year time series of monthly mean a(g)(443) distributions in Tampa Bay between 1998 and 2012. This time series showed significant seasonal and annual variations regulated mainly by river discharge. Testing of the approach over another turbid estuary (Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the U.S.) demonstrated the potential (similar to 25% uncertainties for a limited a(g)(443) range) of using this approach to establish long-term environmental data records (EDRs) of CDOM distributions in other estuaries with similar optical complexity.

This study compares the photodegradation of dilute (<10 mu g L-1) aqueous solutions of AD and T in natural sunlight, and evaluates the endocrine-disrupting potential of the resulting solutions. This study also examines the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on AD photodegradation. During spring and summer at Henderson, NV, USA (latitude 36.04 degrees N), AD and T underwent direct photodegradation, with half-lives ranging from 3.7 to 10.8 h. In three model DOM solutions, AD's half-life increased by 11% to 35%. Using screening factors to eliminate DOM's inner filter effect, quantum yield calculations suggested that light screening was primarily responsible for AD's increased half-life, and that physical quenching further inhibited AD's photodegradation in two out of three DOM solutions. In vitro androgenic activity of the AD and T solutions decreased approximately as fast as AD and T were removed, suggesting that solar photodegradation reduces the risk of endocrine disruption in surface waters impacted by AD or T, subject to continuing inputs. Reduced in vitro androgenic activity appears to be related to steroid ring cleavage and the formation of highly oxidized photoproducts.

Changes in Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) Fluorescence in Proglacial Antarctic Streams	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported in glacier meltwater influences downstream biogeochemical processes, and climate warming may increase the meltwater DOM flux. In this study, we quantify and use fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize DOM exported in glacier meltwater in Taylor and Wright Valleys, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Andersen Creek, a proglacial stream draining Canada Glacier meltwater, exported similar to 20 kg of DOM as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to Lake Hoare during the melt season. Supraglacial snowpack DOM from all of the Dry Valley glaciers sampled exhibits "protein-like" fluorescence indicating that it contains potentially labile moieties that might be a favorable substrate supporting downstream microbial metabolism. However, this protein-like fluorescence does not persist in any of the meltwater streams surveyed, suggesting that it is quickly transformed by resident microbial populations and/or mixed with other DOM pools within stream channels or along its margins. Given the seemingly ubiquitous protein-like fluorescent characteristic of glacier-derived DOM and the immediate change to the bulk DOM in glacier streams, a more thorough characterization of the bulk DOM pool from glacial sources and through downstream ecosystems would yield valuable information about the potential contribution of glacier melt to the global carbon cycle.																	1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2013	45	3					305	317		10.1657/1938-4246-45.3.305						WOS:000329533200001		
J	Karavanova, EI				Karavanova, E. I.			Dissolved organic matter: Fractional composition and sorbability by the soil solid phase (Review of literature)	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The behavior of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils under varying environmental conditions represents a poorly studied aspect of the problem of organic matter loss from soils. The equilibrium and sustainable development of ecosystems in the northern latitudes are largely determined by the balance between the formation of DOM, its accumulation in the lower soil horizons, and its input with runoff into surface waters. The residence time, retention strength in the soil, and thermodynamic and biochemical stabilities depend on the localization of DOM in the pore space and its chemical structure. Amphiphilic properties represent a valuable diagnostic parameter, which can be used to predict the behavior of DOM in the soil. Acidic components of hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature constitute the major portion of DOM in forest soils of the temperate zone. The hydrophilic fraction includes short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, and amino acids and is poorly sorbed by the solid phase. However, the existence of this fraction in soil solution is also limited both in space (in the finest pores) and time because of higher accessibility to microbial degradation. The hydrophilic fraction composes the major portion of labile DOM in soils. The hydrophobic fraction consists of soluble degradation products of lignin; it is enriched in structural ortho-hydroxybenzene fragments, which ensure its selective sorption and strong retention in soils. Sorption is favored by low pH values (3.5-5), the high ionic strength of solution, the heavy texture and fine porous structure of soil, the high contents of oxalate- and dithionite-soluble iron (and aluminum) compounds, and hydrological conditions characterized by slow water movement. The adsorbed DOM is chemically and biochemically recalcitrant and significantly contributes to the humus reserves in the low mineral horizons of soils.

Results indicate that both processes exhibit a high elimination of particulate and microbial contaminants. Both treatments successfully maintain the water turbidity to values <0.1 NTU and SDI15 <2. UF, however, fulfills its purpose by securing almost 100% elimination of algal content while DMF demonstrates an average algae removal of only 60%. Raw seawater shows very low dissolved organic matter content (DOC approximate to 0.9 mg C L-1), and LC-OCD technique revealed that the DOC is mainly composed of humic compounds with size range of 03-10 kDa and low molecular weight (LMW) substances smaller than 03 kDa (47% each). LC-OCD analyses of the DAF + UF and DAF + DMF filtrates give a proportion among the constituents almost constant. Biopolymers in raw seawater were partially removed by both pre-treatments tested (41% removal in UF permeate and 18% removal in DMF filtrate). Lower impact in LMW (6% removal by UF, 1% removal by DMF) and humics (removals of 8% by UF and 2% by DMF) was observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Independent Pb binding capacity determinations for DOC explained the lack of a relationship between DOM concentration and toxicity. Salinity had no effect on Pb toxicity down to 21 ppt in M. trossolus, and low salinity (21 ppt) did not enhance the protective effect of DOC. Both DOMs increased the toxicity of Pb in developing sea urchin embryos, in contrast to mussels. Relative to Pb, the organisms were 6-9 fold less sensitive to Zn on a molar basis in 100% seawater with the following Zn EC50s: M. trossolus - 135 (103-170) mu g L-1; M. galloprovincialis - 172 (126-227) mu g L-1, S. purpuratus - 151 (129-177) mu g L-1. Nordic Reservoir and Inshore DOM (2-12 mg C L-1) had no significant effect on Zn toxicity to mussels, in accord with voltammetry data showing an absence of any strong ligand binding for Zn by DOMs. As with Pb, DOMs increased Zn toxicity to urchin larvae. Critical Tissue Residues (CTR) based on whole body concentrations of Pb and Zn were determined for M. galloprovincialis at 48 h and S. purpuratus at 72 h. The median lethal CTR values (LA50s), useful parameters for development of saltwater Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs), were approximately 4-fold higher on a molar basis for Zn than for Pb. The latter were not altered by DOM exposure, despite increased EC50 values, in accord with the tenets of the BLM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Citrate as a model DOM and three environmental DOM (eDOM) formulations of different quality were used. Biofilms developed with all DOM formulations, and the three species were retained in the biofilm. However, biofilm biomass, species composition, architecture, and colocalization of member strains depended on DOM and its biodegradability. To assess the linuron-degrading functionality, biofilms were subsequently irrigated with linuron at 10 mg liter(-1) or 100 mu g liter(-1). Instant linuron degradation, the time needed to attain maximal linuron degradation, and hence the total amount of linuron removed depended on both the DOM used for growth and the linuron concentration. At 10 mg liter(-1), the final linuron degradation efficiency was as high as previously observed without DOM except for biofilms fed with humic acids which did not degrade linuron. At 100 mu g liter(-1) linuron, DOM-grown biofilms degraded linuron less efficiently than biofilms receiving 10 mg liter(-1) linuron. The amount of linuron removed was more correlated with biofilm species composition than with biomass or structure. Based on visual observations, colocalization of consortium members in biofilms after the DOM feed appears essential for instant linuron-degrading activity and might explain the differences in overall linuron degradation. The data show that DOM quality determines biofilm structure and composition of the pesticide-degrading consortium in periods with DOM as the main carbon source and can affect subsequent pesticide-degrading activity, especially at micropollutant concentrations.																	0099-2240					AUG	2013	79	15					4534	4542		10.1128/AEM.03730-12						WOS:000321255600003	23666338

Redox control on carbon mineralization and dissolved organic matter along a chronosequence of paddy soils	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Paddy soils are subjected to periodically changing redox conditions. In order to understand better the redox control on long-term carbon turnover, we assessed carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of paddy topsoils sampled along a chronosequence spanning 2000years of rice cultivation. Non-paddy soils were used as references. We exposed soils to alternating redox conditions for 12weeks in incubation experiments. Carbon mineralization of paddy soils was independent of redox conditions. Anoxic conditions caused increasing DOC concentrations for paddy soils, probably because of desorption induced by increasing pH. We assume desorption released older, previously stabilized carbon, which then was respired by a microbial community well adapted to anoxic conditions. This assumption is supported by the C-14 signatures of respired CO2, indicating larger mineralization of older carbon under anoxic than under oxic conditions. The increasing DOC concentrations under anoxic conditions did not result in an equivalent increase in carbon mineralization, possibly because of little reducible iron oxide. Therefore, net DOC and CO2 production were not positively related under anoxic conditions. The overall 20-75% smaller carbon mineralization of paddy soils than of non-paddy soils resulted from less respiration under oxic conditions. We conclude that carbon accumulation in paddy as well as in other wetland soils results from a microbial community well adapted to anoxic conditions, but less efficient in mineralizing carbon during transient oxic periods. Carbon accumulation might be even larger when mineralization under anoxic conditions is restricted by a lack of alternative electron acceptors.

CuO NPs (2, 6 and 10 mg/L) exhibited high bacteria toxicity in distilled water prepared medium, with a 2 h median inhibitory concentration of 10 mg/L. The toxicity was significantly reduced by the presence of fulvic acid (FA, 5 and 40 mg/L) which is an important fraction of DOM. Bacteria membranes were highly damaged by CuO NPs, but FA mitigated this damage. Disruption of the bacteria wall and membrane was directly observed using transmission/scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, CuO NPs significantly caused the leakage of K+ ions from bacteria cells to extracellular medium, while this leakage was reduced by FA. The reduced toxicity was due to enhanced electrostatic repulsion and surface coating by FA, therefore, the physical contact between CuO NPs and bacteria membrane was hindered. These findings indicate that DOM is of importance for antibacterial activity of NPs, and more attention should be paid to the effect of DOM when assessing the environmental risk of NPs.

Ionic Liquid Assisted Dissolution of Dissolved Organic Matter and PAHs from Soil Below the Critical Micelle Concentration	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Increased use and production of ionic liquids (ILs) may result in emissions into the environment. Particularly vulnerable are industrial areas and landfills where ILs are utilized and ultimately disposed of. This study investigates how IL contamination can affect soil properties and the sorption of pre-existing contaminants. The commonly used IL 1-methyl-3-octyl imidazolium chloride ([OMIM][Cl]) was added at various quantities to a landfill soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Subsequently, the release of PAHs and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from this soil was thoroughly investigated. Two fractions of PAH release into the porewater were measured, the freely dissolved fraction (measured using a passive sampler) and the total PAH concentration (which includes the freely dissolved molecules as well as those associated with colloids, micelles and DOM). As expected the highest levels of total PAH porewater concentration occurred when the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the IL was exceeded. However, as we report here for the first time, enhanced amounts of freely dissolved PAHs were released by sub-CMC concentrations of IL. Additionally, enhanced levels of DOM, due to dissolution of soil organic matter by IL, were also observed upon addition of sub-CMC IL concentrations. Based on this, enhanced release of pre-existing contaminants and DOM is suggested as a potential risk from IL emissions at trace concentrations well below the CMC. Potential mechanisms of this sub-CMC release are discussed.

J	Laurion, I; Mladenov, N				Laurion, Isabelle; Mladenov, Natalie			Dissolved organic matter photolysis in Canadian arctic thaw ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The abundant thaw lakes and ponds in the circumarctic receive a new pool of organic carbon as permafrost peat soils degrade, which can be exposed to significant irradiance that potentially increases as climate warms and ice cover shortens. Exposure to sunlight is known to accelerate the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into molecules that can be more readily used by microbes. We sampled the water from two common classes of ponds found in the ice-wedge system of continuous permafrost regions of Canada, polygonal and runnel ponds, and followed the transformation of DOM over 12 days by looking at dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM absorption and fluorescence properties. The results indicate a relatively fast decay of color (3.4 and 1.6% loss d(-1) of absorption at 320 nm for the polygonal and runnel pond, respectively) and fluorescence (6.1 and 8.3% loss d(-1) of total fluorescent components, respectively) at the pond surface, faster in the case of humic-like components, but insignificant losses of DOC over the observed period. This result indicates that direct DOM mineralization (photochemical production of CO2) is apparently minor in thaw ponds compared to the photochemical transformation of DOM into less chromophoric and likely more labile molecules with a greater potential for microbial mineralization. Therefore, DOM photolysis in arctic thaw ponds can be considered as a catalytic mechanism, accelerating the microbial turnover of mobilized organic matter from thawing permafrost and the production of greenhouse gases, especially in the most shallow ponds. Under a warming climate, this mechanism will intensify as summers lengthen.																	1748-9326					JUL-SEP	2013	8	3							035026	10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/035026						WOS:000325247100071

Allochthonous DOM (Al-DOM) had higher delta C-13 values than autochthonous DOM (Au-DOM). The delta C-13 of inflow DOM varied from -228.2 parts per thousand to -225.4 parts per thousand (mean -226.7 parts per thousand) and in-lake DOM varied from -228.4 parts per thousand to -26.1 parts per thousand (mean -227.2 parts per thousand). Low stable isotope (SI) signatures of Au-DOM were caused by relatively C-13-depleted values of its precursors (mainly phytoplankton) with mean delta C-13 of -28.9 parts per thousand. SI signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the inflows and in the lake were also relatively low (from -15.1 parts per thousand to -23.28 parts per thousand). SI values of DOM were lower during the active growing season from May to September and higher from October to April, with the corresponding estimated average proportions of Al-DOM 68% and 81%. The proportion of Al-DOM decreased with increasing water temperature, chlorophyll a, and pH and increased with increasing water level and concentration of yellow substances and DIC. The high proportion of Al-DOM in Vortsjarv shows that, even in this highly productive ecosystem, the labile Au-DOM produced is rapidly utilized and degraded by microorganisms and thus makes a relatively small contribution to the instantaneous in-lake DOM pool.

A detailed understanding of the BBD chemistry, particularly the DOM composition, is important for better management and recycle of this water. In this study, we fractionated the dissolved organic matter in the BBD using DAX-8, Dowex, and Duo lite resins into hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of acid, base, and neutral compounds. Additionally, the DOM was fractionated on the basis of size by filtering the BBD through a series of membranes with progressively tighter molecular weight cutoffs of 10, 3, and 0.5 kDa. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and FTIR were used to characterize the water samples and the different fractions. The ion exchange fractionation revealed that the DOM contained a high percentage of hydrophobic acids (39%) and hydrophilic neutrals (28.5%). The different ion exchange fractions had distinct fluorescence excitation-emission signatures. The permeate samples from the membrane fractionation, on the other hand, did not reveal any significant difference in the fluorescence EEM spectra, indicating that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic constituents of the DOM could not be separated on the basis of pore size by these membranes. The SAGD boiler blow-down water was found to be significantly concentrated in DOM compared to oil sands mining process affected water.																	0887-0624					JUL	2013	27	7					3883	3890		10.1021/ef4002154						WOS:000322150200032

The results showed that the fluorescence peaks of loess appears at the regions of lambda(ex/em)=240 similar to 270/280 similar to 340 and lambda(ex/em)=325/450, referred as UV fulvic-like fluorescence, and visible fulvic-like and humic-like fluorescence, respectively. After straw incorporation for 60 days, the intensity of UV fulvic-like fluorescence peaks increases, and novel humic-like fluorescence peaks appears around the region of lambda(ex/em)=250/440 and lambda(ex/em)=320 similar to 350/350 similar to 400. The longer time of straw incorporation would accelerate the humification degree of loess and decrease the bioactivity of Pb(II). The three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum is appropriate for characterization identification of DOM in arid loess before and after straw incorporation.																	1000-0593					JUL	2013	33	7					1820	1823		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2013)07-1820-04						WOS:000321408100020

Impact of deforestation on solid and dissolved organic matter characteristics of tropical peat forests: implications for carbon release	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												This study compares the organic chemistry of peat beneath one of last remaining pristine tropical peat forests in Southeast Asia with a neighbouring peat dome that has been deforested, but not intentionally drained, in the Belait district of Brunei Darussalam, Borneo. We characterized the solid and dissolved organic matter collected from the two domes, through a combination of methods including elemental analysis, phenolic content and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigation of solid peat, as well as optical characterisation (absorbance, fluorescence) of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The peat had a high content of lignin, consistent with its origin from the Shorea albida trees on the domes. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the pore water was significantly greater in the deforested site (79.9 +/- A 5.5 mg l(-1)) than the pristine site (62.2 +/- A 2.2 mg l(-1)). The dissolved organic matter was richer in nitrogen and phenolics in the deforested site. The optical properties (Fluorescence Index) indicated a modification of DOM cycling in the deforested site (enhanced decomposition of the peat and fresh litter). Comparison of the solid peat composition between the two sites also suggests effects of deforestation: sulphur, nitrogen and phenolic contents were higher in the deforested site. Taken together, these observations are consistent with peat enhanced decomposition in the deforested site, even without engineered drainage.				harvey, charles/A-8601-2012; 	harvey, charles/0000-0002-7759-4447; Lim, Linda B.L/0000-0002-4198-8962												0168-2563					JUL	2013	114	1-3					183	199		10.1007/s10533-012-9799-8						WOS:000320718200011

Washing soil with a dissolved organic matter (DOM) solution has been identified as a method that can moderate the loss of nutrients in the soil and enhance metal removal. The DOM solutions were extracted from waste sludge obtained from a local whisky distillery. Single chelating washing and chelate-DOM washing were carried out using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid, and DOM solutions to remediate highly Cu-contaminated soil. Two-phase washing using 034 M citric acid and then 1500 mg L-1 DOM solution (pH 8.5) was found to be most favorable for the soil. With this treatment, 91% Cu was removed from the topsoil; the organic matter, cation exchange capacity, plant-available nitrogen, and available phosphate content increased by 28.1%, 103%, 17.7%, and 422%, respectively.

We examined the absorption and fluorescence characteristics of Tetraselmis spp, Cylindrotheca closterium and Odontella aurita exudates in an axenic culture experiment. The objective was to test the ability of phytoplankton to produce fluorescent DOM (FDOM) apart from protein fluorescent matter in the absence of bacteria, and if so how does the fluorescence efficiency expressed as fluorescence-absorption coefficient ratio of different FDOM components compare. Through our study, the ratio of absorption coefficients at 350 nm and 440 nm (a(350):a(440) ratio) has the potential to be a unique descriptor of the growth condition of algae. It was minimum (4.12 +/- 0.59, n = 14) in the growth phase for the three species. The spectral slope (S300-440) indicates that higher molecular weight compounds are present in exudates when phytoplankton grows than during lag or decay. Protein (tryptophan) like fluorescence was contained in exudates throughout the life cycle. It constituted the most abundant component also, ca., similar to 69% of total fluorescence in Tetraselmis spp, and C. closterium, and similar to 62% in the larger celled O. aurita. The remaining fluorescence was made up of humic like fluorophores of the UV (two varieties), Visible and Marine types, all of which showed maxima at the end of exponential stage. The accumulated fluorescence at the close of the experiment surviving photochemical degradation was maximum for the visible humic fluorophore in Tetraselmis sp. (similar to 187%) and for the protein like fluorophore in O. aurita (71%). (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To test this hypothesis, we exposed DOM from a leachate of a wetland plant (Juncus effusus) to solar radiation or incubated it in the dark for 1.25 yr. Analysis of the extracted DOM of the leachates via Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) identified 2800 molecular formulae. Of the formulae in the initial DOM, 11% were lost during microbial decomposition in the dark and 54% under solar radiation. Solar radiation also produced a large number of formulae containing N, that were preferentially degraded by microorganisms (47% loss). We compared the "recal-citrant formulae'', i.e. those not degraded in the experiment, with those of DOM from the deep North Pacific Ocean. Of the deep sea DOM formulae, 18% were present in the recalcitrant fraction of the initial DOM. An additional 18% of the formulae in marine DOM were photoproduced and recalcitrant, and 8% were produced by microbes in the experiment. Consequently, 44% of the deep sea DOM shares identical molecular formulae with the recalcitrant DOM from the experiment, most of which were produced by the combined action of sunlight and microbes. This indicates that processes in the water column may be more important than the original source in determining the composition of bulk DOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of water chemistry and dissolved organic matter (DOM) molecular size on copper and mercury binding determined by multiresponse fluorescence quenching	CHEMOSPHERE												The effects of water chemistry (i.e. pH and Ca2+ concentration) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration) and DOM quality (i.e. composition and molecular weight) on metal complexation were successfully investigated by a combination of tangential flow filtration, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and fluorescence quenching on four freshwater samples and one extracted Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA). Two terrestrial and one microbial humic-like components were found in this study. Despite strong correlation between the Ryan-Weber model and the multiresponse model, the latter is more appropriate for the calculation of binding parameters in multiple-ligand DOM system. Decreasing pH from 6 to 4 significantly reduced log K-Cu2+ from 5.22 +/- 0.24 to 4.60 +/- 0.30 at pH 6 and 4, respectively (p < 0.001), while the impacts of Ca2+ and DOC were not discernible at concentrations <100 ppm and <2.06 ppm, respectively. For natural freshwater DOM binding, the three humic-like components had similar log K values for both metals. High molecular weight (>1 kDa) DOM generally had higher log K and binding fluorophore abundance than bulk (unfractionated) and low molecular weight (<1 kDa) DOM for both metals. This trend however was not always true for Hg2+ where the binding parameters were quite variable. Overall the combined results provide evidence that binding parameters are not only affected by water chemistry, but also depend on DOM molecular weight. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Investigating dissolved organic matter decomposition in northern peatlands using complimentary analytical techniques	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The chemical transformations that govern storage, degradation, and loss of organic matter in northern peatlands are poorly characterized, despite the significance of these peat deposits as pivotal reservoirs in the global carbon cycle. One of the most challenging problems concerns the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in peat porewaters, particularly higher-molecular weight compounds that may function either as non-reactive sinks or reactive intermediates for organic byproducts of microbial decay. The complexity of these large molecules has defied attempts to characterize their molecular structure in bulk samples with a high degree of precision. We therefore determined the composition and reactivity of DOM from representative bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) in northern Minnesota, USA. We applied four complementary techniques: electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed that the vast majority (>80%) of molecular formulas that appear in the surface bog DOM are also present at 2.9 m depth, indicating that much of DOM in the bog is resistant to microbial degradation. In contrast to bog samples, a considerable number of new compounds with low O/C and high H/C elemental ratios were observed in the 3 m fen horizon relative to surface samples. These results indicate a more pronounced difference in the composition of surface and deep DOM in the fen. SUVA, determined at 254 nm, indicated significantly lower aromaticity in deep fen samples relative to deep bog samples. This trend was verified by H-1 NMR. Aromatic and carbohydrate components represented up to 70% of deep bog DOM but comprised a much smaller proportion of deep fen DOM, which was dominated by functionalized and non-functionalized aliphatics. Molecular formula data determined by FT-ICR mass spectrometry were consistent with results from optical and NMR spectroscopy measurements and showed that compounds with low O/C and high H/C were generated with depth in the fen. Such compounds were absent in both surface fen and in surface and deep bog samples respectively, providing further evidence of qualitative and quantitative differences in the evolution of DOM in fens and bogs. These differences, attributed to either variations in source vegetation or environmental factors that render DOM more reactive in fen sites or less reactive in bog sites, have important implications for the response of peatlands to climate change, since climatic change leading to moister conditions may enhance the abundance of sedge-dominated fens and increase the pool of more labile soil carbon.

Using Hyperion imagery to monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of colored dissolved organic matter in estuarine and coastal regions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Establishing a link between the optical and biogeochemical properties of near-shore waters continues to be a challenge for both riverine and estuarine areas worldwide due to terrestrial influences. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an inversion algorithm for the extraction of riverine and estuarine CDOM properties at global scales. Our CDOM evaluation focused on five aspects: I) the range of worldwide CDOM levels, 2) spatial distribution patterns, (3) climatic influences, (4) influences of land cover change, and (5) seasonal effects. The study locations consisted of the estuarine and coastal regions of 10 major rivers spread across five continents. Our approach was to examine the QAA-CDOM algorithm by extracting CDOM properties from hundreds of EO-1 Hyperion images acquired during the last decade (2001-2011). Preliminary results showed that CDOM absorption coefficients at 440 nm within the 10 selected rivers exhibited a broad range (0.02-72 m(-1)). Spatial CDOM distribution patterns showed many plumes dispersing from source areas (e.g. adjacent terrestrial vegetated areas) along the direction of flow. Seasonal variations in CDOM levels are also evident (i.e. 0.5-4.0 m(-1)) as illustrated by the January, April, August and October images of the Volga River. CDOM levels also appeared to trend upward with the increase in forest coverage (i.e. terrestrial influence) within the watersheds studied over the last decade. Our results strongly suggest that the algorithm is effective in distinguishing riverine and estuarine CDOM levels affected by factors such as global biogeography, climate conditions and regional land surface processes.

However, to date, the organic compounds involved are uncharacterized on the molecular level. At redox interfaces in peatlands, where the biogeochemical cycles of iron and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are coupled, this issue can readily be studied. We found that precipitation of iron hydroxides at the oxic surface layer of two rewetted fens removed a large fraction of DOM via coagulation. On aeration of anoxic fen pore waters, >90% of dissolved iron and 27 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) of dissolved organic carbon were rapidly (within 24 h) removed. Using ultra-high-resolution MS, we show that vascular plant-derived aromatic and pyrogenic compounds were preferentially retained, whereas the majority of carboxyl-rich aliphatic acids remained in solution. We propose that redox interfaces, which are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial settings, are selective yet intermediate barriers that limit the flux of land-derived DOM to oceanic waters.

Whereas South Asia has been shown a primary source region to these particles, detailed sources of these aerosol pollutants remain poorly understood. In this study, the chemical compositions of snow pit samples collected from Jima Yangzong glacier in the central Himalayas were analyzed to obtain information of atmospheric aerosols deposited from summer 2009 to spring 2010. Especially, an Aerodyne high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was used for the first time to chemically characterize the dissolved organic and inorganic matter (DOM and DIM) in snow samples. The concentrations of these species varied seasonally, with high levels observed during the winter-spring period and low levels during the summer monsoon period. On average, the dissolved substances was dominated by organics (58%) with important contributions from inorganic species, NO3- (12.5%), Ca2+ (9.1%), NH4+ (8.7%), and SO4 (2-) (8.1%). DOM was found more oxidized with an average (+/- 1 sigma) atomic oxygen-to-carbon ratio (n(O)/n(C)) of 0.64 (+/- 0.14) and organic mass-to-carbon ratio (OM/OC) of 2.01 (+/- 0.19) during the winter-spring periods compared to the summer season (n(O)/n(C) = 0.31 +/- 0.09 and OM/OC = 1.58 +/- 0.12). In addition, biomass burning particles were found significantly enhanced in snow during the winter-spring periods, consistent with HYSPLIT back trajectory analysis of air mass history, which indicates prevailing atmospheric transport from northwest India and Nepal.

Granular activated carbon adsorption of MIB in the presence of dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												Based on the results of over twenty laboratory granular activated carbon (GAC) column runs, models were developed and utilized for the prediction of 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) breakthrough behavior at parts per trillion levels and verified with pilot-scale data. The influent MIB concentration was found not to impact the concentration normalized breakthrough. Increasing influent background dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration was found to systematically decrease the GAC adsorption capacity for MIB. A series of empirical models were developed that related the throughput in bed volumes for a range of MIB breakthrough targets to the influent DOM concentration. The proportional diffusivity (PD) designed rapid small-scale column test (RSSCT) could be directly used to scale-up MIB breakthrough performance below 15% breakthrough. The empirical model to predict the throughput to 50% breakthrough based on the influent DOM concentration served as input to the pore diffusion model (PDM) and well-predicted the MIB breakthrough performance below a 50% breakthrough. The PDM predictions of throughput to 10% breakthrough well simulated the PD-RSSCT and pilot-scale 10% MIB breakthrough. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted in the FWS-CW system of the water reclamation plant of Hat Yai municipality in Southern Thailand. The FWS system was divided into different layers of FWS-CW components according to their mechanisms and the kinetic coefficient (k). The DOM, in terms of the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) concentrations simulated by the calibrated model, exhibited moderate agreement with the full-scale data. The model showed that the leaching of SCOD from the gravel bed is the most significant mechanism affecting the SCOD concentration in the wetland ponds. Although the organic loading rate (OLR) of the SCOD inflow of the FWS-CW was low, a high SCOD concentration in these ponds was still observed under the conditions of a long hydraulic retention time (HRT) and a slow hydraulic loading rate (HLR). Hence, FWS-CW management should focus on the relationship between HLR and HRT, as well as sludge management in the system, to prevent the release of SCOD. When this model was stimulated with the operational data of the FWS-CW under study, it revealed that the HRT should not exceed 2 days to prevent high SCOD discharge into the water reservoir.

Effect of Dissolved Organic Matter Source and Character on Microbial Hg Methylation in Hg-S-DOM Solutions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a key component of fate and transport models for most metals, including mercury (Hg). Utilizing a suite of diverse DOM isolates, we demonstrated that DOM character, in addition to concentration, influences inorganic Hg (Hg(II)(i)) bioavailability to Hg-rnethylating bacteria. Using a model Hg-methylating bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132, we evaluated Hg-DOM-sulfide bioavailability in washed-cell assays at environmentally relevant Hg/DOM ratios (similar to 1-8 ng Hg/mg C) and sulfide concentrations (1-1000 mu M). All tested DOM isolates significantly enhanced Hg methylation above DOM-free controls (from similar to 2 to >20-fold for 20 mg C/L DOM solutions), but high molecular weight/highly aromatic DOM isolates and/or those with high sulfur content were particularly effective at enhancing Hg methylation. Because these experiments were conducted under conditions of predicted supersaturation with respect to metacinnabar (beta-HgS(s)), we attribute the DOM-dependent enhancement of Hg(II)(i) bioavailability to steric and specific chemical (e.g., DOM thiols) inhibition of beta-HgS(s) growth and aggregation by DOM. Experiments examining the role of DOM across a wide sulfide, gradient revealed that DOM only enhances Hg methylation under fairly low sulfide conditions (less than or similar to 30 mu M), conditions that favor HgS nanoparticle/cluster formation relative to dissolved HgS species.

M.; Jaffe, Rudolf			Photochemical and microbial alteration of dissolved organic matter in temperate headwater streams associated with different land use	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Photochemical and microbial transformations of DOM were evaluated in headwater streams draining forested and human-modified lands (pasture, cropland, and urban development) by laboratory incubations. Changes in DOC concentrations, DOC isotopic signatures, and DOM fluorescence properties were measured to assess the amounts, sources, ages, and properties of reactive and refractory DOM under the influence of photochemistry and/or bacteria. DOC in streams draining forest-dominated watersheds was more photoreactive than in streams draining mostly human-modified watersheds, possibly due to greater contributions of terrestrial plant-derived DOC and lower amounts of prior light exposure in forested streams. Overall, the percentage of photoreactive DOC in stream waters was best predicted by the relative content of terrestrial fluorophores. The bioreactivity of DOC was similar in forested and human-modified streams, but variations were correlated with temperature and may be further controlled by the diagenetic status of organic matter. Alterations to DOC isotopes and DOM fluorescence properties during photochemical and microbial incubations were similar between forested and human-modified streams and included (1) negligible effects of microbial alteration on DOC isotopes and DOM fluorescence properties, (2) selective removal of C-13-depleted and C-14-enriched DOC under the combined influence of photochemical and microbial processes, and (3) photochemical alteration of DOM resulting in a preferential loss of terrestrial humic fluorescence components relative to microbial fluorescence components. This study provides a unique comparison of DOC reactivity in a regional group of streams draining forested and human-modified watersheds and indicates the importance of land use on the photoreactivity of DOC exported from upstream watersheds.

Spatial and seasonal variability of dissolved organic matter in the Cariaco Basin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP) were measured monthly at the CARIACO Time Series station (10 degrees 30N, 64 degrees 40W) in the southeastern Caribbean Sea between 2005 and 2012. Marked seasonal variability in DOC concentrations was observed, with lower values (similar to 66 mu M) in the upper water column (<75m) during the upwelling season (December-April) due to the injection of cool, DOC-impoverished Subtropical Underwater from the Caribbean Sea. During the rainy season (May-November) waters were stratified and upper layer DOC concentrations increased to similar to 71 mu M. Interannual variability in surface (1m) concentrations of DOC was also observed in response to the variable strength in upwelling and stratification that the Cariaco Basin experienced. DON and DOP showed no such seasonality. At depths >350m, DOC concentrations were 564.7 mu M, roughly 10 mu M higher than those in the Caribbean Sea over the same depth range. DON and DOP showed similar vertical profiles to that of DOC, with higher concentrations (6.81.2 mu M N and 0.15 0.09 mu M P) in the upper water column and invariant, lower concentrations at depth (4.81.6 mu M N and 0.10 +/- 0.08 mu M P). Wind-driven advection of surface DOC out of the Cariaco Basin was estimated to support a net export similar to 15 Gmol C yr(-1) into the Caribbean Sea; this rate is comparable to the flux of settling particulate organic carbon to depths >275m within the basin.

J	Zhu, WN; Yu, Q				Zhu, Weining; Yu, Qian			Inversion of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter From EO-1 Hyperion Imagery for Turbid Estuarine and Coastal Waters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The significant implication of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) for water quality and biogeochemical cycle leads to an increasing need of CDOM monitoring in coastal regions. Current ocean-color algorithms are mostly limited to open-sea water and have high uncertainty when directly applied to turbid coastal waters. This paper presents a semianalytical algorithm, quasi-analytical CDOM algorithm (QAA-CDOM), to invert CDOM absorption from Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion satellite images. This algorithm was developed from a widely used ocean-color algorithm QAA and our earlier extension of QAA. The main goal is to improve the algorithm performance for a wide range of water conditions, particularly turbid waters in estuarine and coastal regions. The algorithm development, calibration, and validation were based on our intensive high-resolution underwater measurements, International Ocean Color Coordinating Group synthetic data, and global National Aeronautics and Space Administration Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data Set data. The result shows that retrieved CDOM absorption achieved accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.115 m(-1) and R-2 = 0.73) in the Atchafalaya River plume area. QAA-CDOM is also evaluated for scenarios in three additional study sites, namely, the Mississippi River, Amazon River, and Moreton Bay, where a(g)(440) was in the wide range of 0.01-15 m(-1). It resulted in expected CDOM distribution patterns along the river salinity gradient. This study improves the high-resolution observation of CDOM dynamics in river-dominated coastal margins and other coastal environments for the study of land-ocean interactive processes.

J	Zhang, J; Yang, GP				Zhang Jing; Yang Guipeng			Chemical properties of colored dissolved organic matter in the sea-surface microlayer and subsurface water of Jiaozhou Bay, China in autumn and winter	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The distribution and chemical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Jiaozhou Bay, China were examined during four cruises in 2010-2011. The influence of freshwater and industrial and municipal sewage along the eastern coast of the bay was clearly evident as CDOM levels (defined as a(305)), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were well correlated with salinity during all the cruises. Moreover, DOC concentrations were significantly correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations in the surface microlayer as well as in the subsurface water. The concentrations of DOC and CDOM displayed a gradually decreasing trend from the northwestern and eastern coast to the central bay, and the values and gradients of their concentrations on the eastern coast were generally higher than those on the western coast. In addition, CDOM and DOC levels were generally higher in the surface microlayer than in the subsurface water. In comparison with DOC, CDOM exhibited a greater extent of enrichment in the microlayer in each cruise, with average enrichment factor (EF) values of 1.38 and 1.84, respectively. Four fluorescent components were identified from the surface microlayer and subsurface water samples and could be distinguished as peak A, peak T, peak B and peak M. For all the cruises, peak A levels were higher in the surface microlayer than in the subsurface water. This pattern of variation might be attributed to the terrestrial input.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JUN	2013	32	6					26	39		10.1007/s13131-013-0306-4						WOS:000320094400005

The role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality in the growth enhancement of Alexandrium fundyense (Dinophyceae) in laboratory culture	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Several algal species responsible for harmful algal blooms (HABs), such as Alexandrium fundyense, are mixotrophic under certain environmental conditions. The ability to switch between photosynthetic and heterotrophic modes of growth may play a role in the development of HABs in coastal regions. We examined the influence of humic dissolved organic matter (HDOM) derived from terrestrial (plant/soil) and microbial sources on the growth of A.fundyense. We found that a terrestrially derived HDOM, Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA), did enhance A.fundyense growth; however, a microbially derived HDOM, Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA) did not enhance growth. A.fundyense grows in association with bacteria in culture and we observed that bacterial cell densities were much lower in A.fundyense cultures than in bacteria-only cultures, consistent with bacterial grazing by A.fundyense in culture. In bacteria-only cultures with added algal exudates (EX), the addition of PLFA and SRHA resulted in a slight increase in bacterial cell density compared to cultures without HDOM added. Changes over time in the chemical quality of the HDOM in the A.fundyense cultures reflected contributions of microbially derived material with similar characteristics as the PLFA. Overall, these results suggest that the chemical differences between SRHA and PLFA are responsible for the greater effect of SRHA on A.fundyense growth, and that the differential effect is not a result of an effect on the growth of associated bacteria.

The resin adsorption technique (with XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins) was employed to characterize the dissolved organic matter in soils into five fractions, i.e., hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N), and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The synchronous fluorescence spectra revealed the presence of soluble microbial byproduct- and humic acid-like components and polycyclic aromatic compounds in DOM in soils, and SAT operation resulted in the enrichment of these fluorescent materials in all DOM fractions in the surface soil (0-12.5 cm). More importantly, the quantitative method of fluorescence regional integration was used in the analysis of excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra of DOM fractions in soils. The cumulative EEM volume (I broken vertical bar (T, n) ) results showed that SAT operation led to the enrichment of more fluorescent components in HPO-A and TPI-A, as well as the dominance of less fluorescent components in HPO-N, TPI-N, and HPI in the bottom soil (75-150 cm). Total I broken vertical bar (T, n) values, which were calculated as , suggested an accumulation of fluorescent organic matter in the upper 75 cm of soil as a consequence of SAT operation. The distribution of volumetric fluorescence among five regions (i.e., P (i, n) ) results revealed that SAT caused the increased content of humic-like fluorophores as well as the decreased content of protein-like fluorophores in both HPO-A and TPI-A in soils.																	0167-6369					JUN	2013	185	6					4591	4603		10.1007/s10661-012-2890-8						WOS:000318503100008	23054268

Microbial transformation of dissolved organic matter from different sources and its influence on disinfection byproduct formation potentials	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Biodegradation-induced changes in the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the subsequent effects on disinfection byproduct formation potentials (DBPFPs) were investigated using six different sources of DOM (algae, leaf litter, reed, compost, paddy water, and treated municipal sewage effluent). Microbial incubation of the DOM samples increased the specific ultraviolet absorbance and humic-like fluorescence but decreased the protein/tannin-like fluorescence and relative distribution of smaller-sized DOM components. Comparison of the original versus biodegraded DOM samples using resin fractionation and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that the biodegradation-induced changes were highly dependent on DOM sources and exhibited no consistent trends among the different sources. Changes in DBPFPs also differed with DOM source. Vascular plant-derived DOM (leaf litter and reed) demonstrated an enhancement in specific DBPFP after biodegradation, whereas little change or even a slight decrease was observed for the other DOM sources. Correlations that were significant between specific DBPFPs and the aromatic content or humic-like fluorescence for the original DOM samples were no longer significant after microbial degradation. The relative abundance of hydrophobic to hydrophilic structures in DOM is suggested to be a general indicator for the formation potential of trihalomethanes irrespective of DOM source and the state of biodegradation.																	0944-1344					JUN	2013	20	6					4176	4187		10.1007/s11356-012-1384-0						WOS:000318779200065	23247528

Three sources of freshwater DOM (extracted by reverse osmosis) and 2 sources of marine DOM (extracted using a solid-phase technique) were used. Artificial salt water was used to prepare the experimental media. Different combinations of Cu concentrations and DOM sources and concentrations were tested at salinities of 5, 15, and 30 ppt. Toxicity data (48-h median lethal concentration [LC50] values) were calculated based on dissolved Cu concentrations. In a broad view, data showed that increasing salinity was protective against the acute waterborne Cu toxicity. In general, Cu toxicity was also lower in the presence than in the absence of DOM. Toxicity (48-h LC50) values from all treatments at the same salinity showed a positive linear relationship with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Thus, the protective effect of DOM against the acute Cu toxicity seems to be dependent mainly on the DOM concentration. However, it seems also to be dependent to some extent on the source of DOM used. In summary, findings reported in the present study clearly indicate that both salinity and DOM (source and concentration) should be taken into account in the development of an estuarine version of the biotic ligand model.

We have utilized a long-term fertilization and soil warming experiment in Northern Sweden to study the effects of increased nutrient levels and increased temperature on DOC transport under the O horizon. The site is N limited and mean annual temperature 2 degrees C. Experimental fertilization with ammonium nitrate and a physiological mixture of other macro- and micro-nutrients has been going on for 22 years and soil warming, 5 degrees C above ambient soil temperature for 14 years, prior to the study. Experimental plots have been irrigated to avoid drying and we also studied the effect of this long-term irrigation on DOC by establishing control plots receiving no irrigation. DOC concentrations and fluxes under the O horizon were approximately 50% higher in fertilized plots than in non-fertilized control plots. We did not find any statistically significant effect of soil warming. There was a statistically significant effect of long-term irrigation on DOC with higher DOC concentration and fluxes in irrigated plots than in plots without irrigation. There were no major effects on DOC quality measured by specific UV absorbance. Fertilization approximately doubled soil organic matter stocks in the O horizon, whereas there were no such effects of warming or irrigation on soil organic matter amounts. There was no statistically significant treatment effect on DOC collected from the B horizon. We hypothesize that the positive effect of fertilization on DOC is related to increased soil C stocks.

Denitrification in vadose zone material amended with dissolved organic matter from topsoil and subsoil	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Limited information is available on the potential of subsoil and underlying alluvial gravels (vadose zone) to denitrify leached nitrate, though it is recognized that C availability is an important constraint. In this laboratory study, we used samples (<4 tom fraction) from subsoil (0.4-0.85 m depth) and alluvial gravel layers (1.2-4.8 m) derived from a site in Canterbury, New Zealand, to quantify denitrification potential and examine the denitrification response to inputs of dissolved organic C (DOC). As C sources, we used DOC extracted in either cold (20 degrees C) or hot (80 degrees C) water from topsoil and subsoil (assumed to represent C substrates likely to be transported into the subsoil in drainage). Measurements of potential denitrification enzyme activity (DEA, via samples amended with glucose and nitrate-N) showed the alluvial gravel samples had denitrification capability although rates were low (<5 mu g N2O-N kg(-1) h(-1)) compared with those reported for topsoils. The effect of the soil-derived DOC, at addition rates 16-215 mg kg(-1), on denitrification was determined in a 7-d anaerobic incubation using acetylene to block reduction of N2O to N-2. There was a lag of 24-36 h, during which N2O production was low, followed by a period of rapid increase (36-96 h), and a final phase (120-168 h) in which N2O concentrations remained relatively stable. During the rapid phase, the N2O production rate was very high (up to 440-500 mu g N kg(-1) h(-1) at the highest DOC addition rate) and exceeded that measured in the 8-h DEA assay (a measure of indigenous denitrifier enzymes). The post-96 h decline in N2O production rate was attributed to depletion of available C. The temporal pattern of CO2-C production was similar to that of N2O, though the lag period was shorter (12-24 h). The ratio of N2O-N to CO2-C increased with time; the maximum was circa 0.3:1 at the highest addition rate of hot water extractable DOC. Our results suggest that, with input of DOC substrate, alluvial gravel materials could generate enough enzyme during a 1-2 day anaerobic period to denitrify significant quantities of nitrate. However, in situ denitrification in alluvial gravels may be low because of biophysical limitations such as low C inputs of bioavailable C and anaerobicity mostly confined to localized zones or lenses.

The sources of water in the basin consisted of two reservoirs and the U-Tapao canal. The canal receives water discharge from reservoirs, treated and untreated wastewater from agricultural processes, communities and industries. Water downstream of the canal is utilized as a raw water supply. Water samples were collected from two reservoirs, upstream and midstream of the canal, and the raw water supply in the rainy season and summer. The DOM level in the canal water was higher than that of the reservoir water. The highest trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) was formed in the raw water supply. Fourier-transform infrared peaks of the humic acid were detected in the reservoir and canal waters. Aliphatic hydrocarbon and organic nitrogen were the major chemical classes in the reservoir and canal water characterized by a pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometer. The optimal condition of the poly aluminum chloride (PACl) coagulation was obtained at a dosage of 40mg/L at pH 7. This condition could reduce the average UV-254 to 57%, DOC to 64%, and THMFP to 42%. In the coagulated water, peaks of O-H groups or H-bonded NH, CO of cyclic and acyclic compounds, ketones and quinines, aromatic CC, C-O of alcohols, ethers, and carbohydrates, deformation of COOH, and carboxylic acid salts were detected. The aliphatic hydrocarbon, organic nitrogen and aldehydes and ketones were the major chemical classes. These DOM could be considered as the prominent DOM for the water supply plant that utilized PACl as a coagulant.																	1093-4529					JUN 1	2013	48	7					760	771		10.1080/10934529.2013.744634						WOS:000315687000010	23445419

Bioturbation and Dissolved Organic Matter Enhance Contaminant Fluxes from Sediment Treated with Powdered and Granular Activated Carbon	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sediment amendment with activated carbon (AC) is a promising technique for in situ sediment remediation. To date it is not dear whether this technique sufficiently reduces sediment-to-water fluxes of sediment bound hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) in the presence of bioturbators. Here, we report polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) pore water concentrations, fluxes, mass transfer coefficients, and survival data of two benthic species, for four treatments: no AC addition (control), powdered AC addition, granular AC addition and addition and subsequent removal of GAC (sediment stripping). AC addition decreased mass fluxes but increased apparent mass transfer coefficients because of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) facilitated transport across the benthic boundary layer (BBL). In turn, DOC concentrations depended on bioturbator activity which was high for the PAC tolerant species Asellus aquaticus and low for AC sensitive species Lumbriculus variegatus. A dual BBL resistance model combining AC effects on gradients, DOC facilitated transport and biodiffusion was evaluated against the data and showed how the type of resistance differs with treatment and chemical hydrophobicity. Data and simulations illustrate the complex interplay between AC and contaminant toxicity to benthic organisms and how differences in species tolerance affect mass fluxes from sediment to the water column.

J	Chang, H; Chen, CY; Wang, G				Chang, Huihsien; Chen, Chiayang; Wang, Genshuh			Characteristics of C-, N-DBPs formation from nitrogen-enriched dissolved organic matter in raw water and treated wastewater effluent	WATER RESEARCH												The objective of this study is to clarify the relationships between the characteristics of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. Treated wastewater effluents from the Neihu wastewater treatment plant in Taipei City (TN) and source waters from the Tai Lake water treatment plant in Kinmen (KT) were evaluated. These water samples were fractionated to obtain 7 DON isolates with different characteristics. The DON isolates were freeze-dried and re-dissolved to different DON fraction solutions containing 10 mg-C/L of non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon (NPDOC). The DBPs formation potentials (DBPFPs) (trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and nitrosamines) of different DON fraction solutions were then assessed with chlorine and monochloramine treatments. After fractionation schemes, mass concentrations of dried DON-enriched isolates ranged from 0.2 to 46.4 mg/L. Both TN effluents and KT raw waters had similar compositions of DON fractions except for the amounts of amphiphilic bases/neutrals (AMPB/N) isolates: hydrophobic acids (HPOA) > hydrophilic acids/neutrals (HPIA/N) > AMPB/N of KT raw waters > hydrophilic bases (HPIB) > amphiphilic acids (AMPA) > hydrophobic bases/neutrals (HPOB/N) > AMPB/N of TN effluents > amino acids (AA). For carbonated DBPs (C-DBPs), AA fraction treated with NaOCl formed the greatest amounts of C-DBPs (up to 1258.2 mu g/L of THMs and 1140.6 mu g/L of HAAs). For nitrogenated DBPs (N-DBPs), the AMPB/N fraction (DON = 1.4 mg-N/L) treated with NH2Cl was the most important precursor to form N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and generated up to 9238.0 ng/L of NDMA from KT raw water. Taking both DBP formation and organic composition into account, the HPOA (31.9%-38.4%)/HPIA/N (17.6%-35.7%) fractions and AMPB/N fraction (38.4%-93.9%) were the most important contributors to the overall C-DBPFPs and N-DBPFPs, respectively.

This study characterized proteins of high-molecular-weight DOM (size between 5 kDa and <0.2 mu m, HMW-DOM) collected from the surface seawaters in the South China Sea using a shotgun proteomic approach in combination with the global ocean sampling combined assembly protein database. A total of 367 protein groups matched by 993 unique peptides from 1991 spectra were identified from four surface HMW-DOM samples. Proteins with unknown taxonomic classification and function dominated the dissolved protein pool (43-53%) while the remaining proteins presented close similarity in biological origin among the four sampling sites. Rhodospirillaceae, Prochlorococcus, SAR11 clade and viruses were the major contributors to dissolved proteins in the HMW-DOM from surface seawaters while very few proteins were from the eukaryotic phytoplankton and no archaeal proteins were detected. Transporters with substrate specificities for nitrogen-and carbon-containing compounds (1.5% of the total spectra for each) were highly detected while no phosphate transporters were found, suggesting that carbon and nitrogen might be more limiting than phosphorus in the surface seawater. Viral proteins were assigned into three families: Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae, and the Myoviridae proteins were the most abundant. Among them, structure proteins were the most abundant viral proteins. This study indicated that the dissolved proteins of HMW-DOM presented compositional and biologically original homogeneity in the surface seawaters of the South China Sea, and bacteria and viruses dominated the dissolved protein pool.

Response of phytoplankton in an alpine lake to inputs of dissolved organic matter through nutrient enrichment and trophic forcing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Inputs of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) are increasing in alpine lakes due to multiple drivers such as climate change, tree line advancement, and insect epidemics. A 21 d microcosm experiment investigated three potential mechanisms by which increased inputs of terrestrial DOM subsidies might affect phytoplankton density, growth, and species assemblage: (1) directly, by providing nutrients enhancing growth of select phytoplankton species (nutrient stimulation hypothesis); (2) indirectly, through trophic forcing of zooplankton uniformly increasing the total biomass of all zooplankton that selectively graze on phytoplankton (trophic intensity hypothesis); and (3) indirectly, through trophic forcing of zooplankton by favoring zooplankton species that selectively graze on phytoplankton (trophic shift hypothesis). We manipulated DOM (terrestrial DOM additions vs. unmanipulated control), zooplankton (presence vs. absence), and incubation depth (epilimnion vs. hypolimnion) in a full 3 x 3 factorial design. Phytoplankton density and growth increased substantially and species assemblage shifted to near dominance by Asterionella formosa in the presence of DOM. Zooplankton biomass and growth increased with the addition of DOM, yet the species assemblage remained stable across treatments, and contributed to selective grazing effects on phytoplankton. Our data support the nutrient stimulation and trophic intensity hypotheses. While DOM effects have been classically attributed to stimulation by addition of fixed carbon, our experiments indicate that nutrient stimulation is also important. Additionally, the indirect DOM effect of trophic forcing can occur in the absence of selective effects of DOM on zooplankton.																	0024-3590					MAY	2013	58	3					867	880		10.4319/lo.2013.58.3.0867						WOS:000322491100009

Fluorescence excitation emission matrices were further analyzed by creating a Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model specific to sedimentary pore-water DOM. The range of absolute pore-water DOC concentrations (similar to 26-183 mg C L-1) greatly exceeded abundances reported for other wetlands and generally increased with depth. Significant changes occurred in epsilon 280 and fluorescence seasonally. Prairie pothole pore-water DOM is primarily allochthonous in nature and three 'humic-like' components explained similar to 90% of total sample fluorescence, while a single 'non-humic' component was responsible for the remaining 10%. The contribution of the non-humic component, however, was more significant in the top 7 cm of sediment in samples collected in early autumn and is presumably derived from algal precursor material produced by primary production in the water column over the summer. The PARAFAC results corroborate epsilon 280 and MWD changes in pore-water DOM composition over the growing season. This dynamic process could affect the type of DOM available for biogeochemical processes seasonally.

Fractions of MW > 30 kDa constituted 87% of DOM and were the main THMs precursors, which exhibited higher specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and THMs formation potential (THMFP) and should be reduced to control THMs formation. For these fractions, THMs formation was mostly attributed to slow chlorine decay, and THMs yield coefficients were low because halogenated intermediates derived from the macromolecular DOM were difficult to decompose to produce THMs. Moreover, there was a strong linear correlation between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and THMFP (R-2 = 0.981), as well as between the SUVA and specific THMFP (R-2 = 0.993) in all fractions.

Experimental results showed that the system performed excellent pollutants' removal efficiencies. The increase of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) for the dynamic membrane (DM) could be divided into three stages, i.e., zero increase stage, slow increase stage and abrupt rise stage. The maximal fouling rate of the DM reached to 4.34 kPa/h in abrupt rise stage. It was observed that the polysaccharides (PS) concentration of DOM samples gradually increased from the anaerobic zone to the aerobic zone in sequence, but the proteins (PN) concentration performed an opposite trend. The DM could retain a small part of the large molecular substances (>10 kDa) in the aerobic zone. Two particular fluorescence peaks appeared in the anaerobic zone and in the anoxic zone were also found in the effluent, which illustrated the dynamic cake layer closed to the stainless steel mesh might induce an anaerobic/anoxic micro environment. Based on the three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, aromatic proteins, aromatic protein-like substance, fulvic acid-like substances and soluble microbial by-product-like materials could be biodegraded effectively in the DMBR, and the DM could partly remove the humic acid-like substances and soluble microbial by-product-like materials.

Sulfamethazine Sorption to Soil: Vegetative Management, pH, and Dissolved Organic Matter Effects	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Elucidating veterinary antibiotic interactions with soil is important for assessing and mitigating possible environmental hazards. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of vegetative management, soil properties, and >1000Da dissolved organic matter (DOM>1000Da) on sulfamethazine (SMZ) behavior in soil. Sorption experiments were performed over a range of SMZ concentrations (2.5-50 mu mol L-1) using samples from three soils (Armstrong, Huntington, and Menfro), each planted to one of three vegetation treatments: agroforestry buffers strips (ABS), grass buff er strips (GBS), and row crops (RC). Our results show that SMZ sorption isotherms are well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model (log K-f = 0.44-0.93; Freundlich nonlinearity parameter = 0.59-0.79). Further investigation of solid-to-solution distribution coefficients (K-d) demonstrated that vegetative management significantly (p < 0.05) influences SMZ sorption (ABS > GBS > RC). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that organic carbon (OC) content, pH, and initial SMZ concentration were important properties controlling SMZ sorption. Study of the two most contrasting soils in our sample set revealed that increasing solution pH (pH 6.0-7.5) reduced SMZ sorption to the Armstrong GBS soil, but little pH effect was observed for the Huntington GBS soil containing 50% kaolinite in the clay fraction. The presence of DOM>1000Da (150 mg L-1 OC) had little significant effect on the Freundlich nonlinearity parameter; however, DOM>1000Da slightly reduced SMZ K-d values overall. Our results support the use of vegetative buffers to mitigate veterinary antibiotic loss from agroecosystems, provide guidance for properly managing vegetative buff er strips to increase SMZ sorption, and enhance understanding of SMZ sorption to soil.																	0047-2425					MAY-JUN	2013	42	3					794	805		10.2134/jeq2012.0222						WOS:000318213000019	23673946

Improved Fluorescence Excitation-Emission Matrix Regional Integration to Quantify Spectra for Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The purpose of this short communication is to demonstrate the importance of numerical analysis and wavelength increment selection when characterizing fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) regional integration. A variety of water samples, representing a landscape gradient and different types of FDOM, were analyzed for their percentage distribution of five operationally defined FDOM fractions (aromatic protein I, aromatic protein II, fulvic acid-like, soluble microbial byproduct-like, and humic acid-like) using three numerical methods in integrating volume under the surface of the fluorescence EEMs: Riemann summation, composite trapezoidal rule, and composite Simpson's rule. The influence of wavelength increment was also examined for the precision of the percentage distribution of each fraction. Our results show that the FDOM fraction estimated by Riemann summation with a 10- or 5-nm excitation wavelength can cause >40% or >5% errors, respectively, when compared with the best estimated values obtained by averaging results from composite trapezoidal rule and composite Simpson's rule with 1-nm excitation wavelength at the same emission increment. Also, our experiments show that fluorescence matrix regional integration could underestimate the two aromatic protein fractions but could overestimate the soluble microbial byproduct-like and humic acid-like fractions if improper increment and integral methods are used. The error can be reduced if a smaller wavelength increment is used. The smallest increment in a spectrofluorometer and composite Simpson's rule should be used for scanning fluorescence EEMs and calculating the percentage distribution of each FDOM fraction. Alternatively, 5-nm wavelength increments with composite Simpson's rule could be cost effective, and the error of each FDOM fraction commonly falls within 5% compared with those estimated by 1-nm increments.

Molecular weight distribution of phosphorus fraction of aquatic dissolved organic matter	CHEMOSPHERE												This study characterized dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) that is discharged from the Everglades Agricultural Area as part of the larger pool of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM). Whole water samples collected at the Everglades stormwater treat area 1 West (STA-1 W) were fractionated using a batch ultrafiltration method to separate organic compounds based on apparent molecular weight (AMW). Each AMW fraction of DOM was characterized for phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, UV absorbance, and fluorescence. The DOP content of the Everglades water matrix was characteristically variable constituting 4-56% of total phosphorus (TP) and demonstrated no correlation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Measured values for DOP exceeded 14 mu g L-1 in four out of five sampling dates making phosphorus load reductions problematic for the stormwater treatment areas (STAs), which target inorganic phosphorus and have a goal of 10 mu g L-1 as TP. The molecular weight distributions revealed 40% of DOP is high molecular weight, aromatic-rich DOM. The results of this research are expected to be of interest to environmental chemists, environmental engineers, and water resources managers because DOP presents a major obstacle to achieving TP levels <10 mu g L-1.

After growing HE S. alfredii, the rhizosphere soil solution pH of heavily polluted soil (HPS) and slightly polluted soil (SPS) was reduced by 0.49 and 0.40 units, respectively, due to enhanced DOC derived from root exudation. The total Cd concentration in soil solution decreased significantly but the decrease accounted for less than 1% of the total Cd uptake in the shoots of HE S. alfredii. Visual MINTEQ speciation predicted that Cd-DOM complexes were the dominant Cd species in soil solutions after the growth of S. alfredii for both soils, followed by the free metal Cd2+ species. However, Cd-DOM complexes fraction in the rhizosphere soil solution of HE S. alfredii (89.1% and 74.6% for HPS and SPS, respectively) were much greater than NHE S. alfredii (82.8% and 64.7% for HPS and SPS, respectively). Resin equilibration experiment results indicated that DOM from the rhizosphere (R-DOM) of both ecotypes of S. alfredii had the ability to form complexes with Cd, whereas the degree of complexation was significantly higher for HE-R-DOM (79-89%) than NHE-R-DOM (63-74%) in the undiluted sample. The addition of HE-R-DOM significantly (P < 0.05) increased the solubility of four Cd minerals while NHE-R-DOM was not as effective at the same concentration. It was concluded that DOM in the rhizosphere of hyperaccumulating ecotype of S. alfredii could significantly increase Cd mobility through the formation of soluble DOM-metal complexes.

Effect of Ozone in UF-Membrane Flux and Dissolved Organic Matter of Secondary Effluent	OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												The focus of this work was to determine the effect of ozone on the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a secondary effluent and its relation with the permeated flux behavior in an ultrafiltration membrane. To assess the ozone action, the DOM of the secondary effluent was fractionated into its hydrophobic, transphilic and hydrophilic fractions, using XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins. Ozone increased the hydrophilic fraction from 32% to 42%, and this percentage remained unchanged after ultrafiltration of the secondary effluent. Permeate flux dropped to 52% in the first hour of membrane operation, but when ozone was applied as a pretreatment, it could be maintained at 84% within the first hour.																	0191-9512					MAY 1	2013	35	3					208	216		10.1080/01919512.2013.771940						WOS:000317951600007

Differential production yet chemical similarity of dissolved organic matter across a chronosequence with contrasting nutrient availability in Hawaii	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical phase in terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling forming the basis of many ecosystem functions, yet the primary drivers controlling its flux from organic horizons and resultant chemical composition remain only partially understood. We studied dissolved organic matter production and chemistry from organic soil horizons across a 4.1 My old well-constrained chronosequence in Hawaii. Controlled soil column irrigation and leaching experiments were conducted on field moist organic soil horizons to quantify microbial activity, DOM production and chemistry. Both microbial activity (defined as CO2 production per unit substrate C) and DOM production were found to be lowest in the youngest (0.3 ky) and oldest (4.1 My) sites of the chronosequence, where nutrients (N and P respectively) were most limiting. By contrast, DOM production and microbial activity was greatest at the intermediate-aged (20-350 ky) sites where nutrients were least limiting, unrelated to the mass of organic matter found in the organic horizons. While differences in production rates were found, C-13 NMR spectroscopic results indicated that there was a convergence of chemistry from the solid to the dissolved phase at all sites. In particular, all DOM samples were found to have a high proportion of aromatic acids. With supporting data from a diverse range of ecosystems, we postulate that chemical homogenization of DOM relative to source material is a common feature of many ecosystems due to two microbially mediated processes: (1) similar extracellular enzymatic oxidation conferring solubility to a subset of degradation products; and (2) the rapid selective consumption of the more labile organic compounds in the soil solution.

Quantifying metal ions binding onto dissolved organic matter using log-transformed absorbance spectra	WATER RESEARCH												This study introduces the concept of consistent examination of changes of log-transformed absorbance spectra of dissolved organic matter (DOM) at incrementally increasing concentrations of heavy metal cations such as copper, cadmium, and aluminum at environmentally relevant concentrations. The approach is designed to highlight contributions of low-intensity absorbance features that appear to be especially sensitive to DOM reactions. In accord with this approach, log-transformed absorbance spectra of fractions of DOM from the Suwannee River were acquired at varying pHs and concentrations of copper, cadmium, and aluminum. These log-transformed spectra were processed using the differential approach and used to examine the nature of the observed changes of DOM absorbance and correlate them with the extent of Me-DOM complexation. Two alternative parameters, namely the change of the spectral slope in the range of wavelengths 325-375 nm (DSlope(325-375)) and differential logarithm of DOM absorbance at 350 nm (DLnA(350)) were introduced to quantify Cu(II), Cd(II), and Al(III) binding onto DOMs. DLnA(350) and DSlope(325-375) datasets were compared with the amount of DOM-bound Cu(II), Cd(II), and Al(III) estimated based on NICA-Donnan model calculations. This examination showed that the DLnA(350) and DSlope(325-375) acquired at various pH values, metal ions concentrations, and DOM types were strongly and unambiguously correlated with the concentration of DOM-bound metal ions. The obtained experimental results and their interpretation indicate that the introduced DSlope(325-375) and DLnA(35) parameters are predictive of and can be used to quantify in situ metal ions interactions with DOMs. The presented approach can be used to gain more information about DOM-metal interactions and for further optimization of existing formal models of metal-DOM complexation.

Max; Fiske, Greg; Mann, Paul J.; Stubbins, Aron			Chromophoric dissolved organic matter export from U.S. rivers	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluxes and yields from 15 major U.S. rivers draining an assortment of terrestrial biomes are presented. A robust relationship between CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loads is established (e.g., a350 versus DOC; r(2)=0.96, p<0.001). Calculated CDOM yields are also correlated to watershed percent wetland (e.g. a350; r(2)=0.81, p<0.001) providing a method for the estimation of CDOM export from ungauged watersheds. A large variation in CDOM yields was found across the rivers. The two rivers in the north-eastern U.S. (Androscoggin and Penobscot), the Edisto draining into the South Atlantic Bight, and some rivers draining into the Gulf of Mexico (Atchafalaya and Mobile) exhibit the highest CDOM yields, linked to extensive wetlands in these watersheds. If the Edisto CDOM yield is representative of other rivers draining into the South Atlantic Bight, this would result in a CDOM load equivalent to that of the Mississippi from a region of approximately 10% of the Mississippi watershed, indicating the importance of certain regions with respect to the role of terrigenous CDOM in ocean color budgets.

Two Dimensional Correlation Analysis of Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectra of Dissolved Organic Matter: A New Graphical Analysis of Trends	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis was applied to 20 Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectra (FTICR-MS) of ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter samples from a salinity transect of the lower Chesapeake Bay. We were able to investigate the chemical changes in the dissolved organic matter pool at the molecular level and classify the individual peaks based on their biogeochemical reactivity. The power of this technique is its ability to be used on either the presence/absence of the individual peaks or their normalized magnitudes. The presence or absence of the peaks are utilized to identify the reactivity and correlation between peaks that plot in different regions of the van Krevelen diagram, whereas the normalized magnitudes are used to correlate the changes among individual peaks. One of the promising advantages of 2D correlation of FTICR-MS data is the ability to associate the variations of the individual peaks with the changes in the functional groups that are measured by other spectroscopic techniques. This approach takes us one step further from identifying molecular formulas to proposing chemical structures.																	0003-2700					APR 16	2013	85	8					3895	3902		10.1021/ac303221j						WOS:000317794800017	23472832

Liquid chromatographic approach to investigation of dissolved organic matter adsorptive fractionation and competitive displacement on minerals	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS												Although physicochemical processes at liquid/solid boundaries are critical in several increasingly important areas of environmental science and engineering, research methods used to contact solutes and adsorbents have changed little in recent decades. We describe an emerging liquid chromatographic (LC) experimental approach which can be used to investigate various phenomena at liquid/solid boundaries, and we report its application in studies of Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) adsorptive fractionation and phosphate competitive displacement on aluminum oxide coated quartz (AlQ). This LC-based approach is similar to continuous-flow column (i.e., breakthrough) methods. However, using the LC auto-injection system, 'pulsed' (i.e., non-continuous) additions of adsorbate (or displacement agent) are made onto adsorbent-packed columns, and non-adsorbed (or displaced) ligands are monitored in multiple optical chromatographic detection channels. We applied the LC-based method in this area of research because (i) this method promises to be more efficient (in materials and analytical/experimental time) than conventional (batch and continuous-flow column) methods, and (ii) it generates unique data that reveal changes in of solution-phase adsorbate mixture compositions due to preferential adsorption or displacement effects. In an SRHA-AIQ adsorption study, detector signal ratios suggested preferential adsorption of high molecular weight (MW) SRHA constituents. When phosphate ions reacted with SRHA-saturated AlQsurfaces, these ratios indicated preferential displacement of low MW SRHA constituents. Adsorption and displacement results agreed, indicating relatively high MW SRHA constituents bound with greatest affinity. Results agree with previous studies of similar adsorbate-adsorbent systems conducted using conventional methods, which validates this method. Each of these experiments, which provided data on both adsorptive fractionation and competitive displacement, was completed in the timeframe of a typical chromatographic experiment and consumed <1 mg adsorbate and <2g adsorbent. Based on its temporal and materials efficiencies and its ability to yield unique forms of data pertaining to the interactions of complex organic ligand mixtures with adsorbent surfaces, this LC-based method will be an important alternative and/or complementary technique that will provide new insights into the interplay of processes that ultimately govern humic substances adsorption.

The organic matter fractions were characterised using liquid chromatography-organic carbon detector (LC-OCD). Results showed the hydrophobic compounds removal was dominant by both flocculants. However, the removal of hydrophilic organic compounds, such as humics and low-molecular weight neutral compounds of seawater, was superior by TiCl4 flocculation compared to FeCl3 flocculation and this removal increased considerably with the increase of TiCl4 doses. The flocculated sludge after TiCl4 flocculation was incinerated to produce titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle. TiO2 from seawater sludge characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) showed predominant anatase phase with Si as a main dopant.

The sampling of surface seawater and coastal groundwater was conducted in Hwasun Bay, Jeju, in three sampling campaigns (October 2010, January 2011, and June 2011). We observed conservative mixing of these components in this subterranean environment for a salinity range from 0 to 32. The fresh groundwater was characterized by relatively high DON, DIN, and CDOM, while the marine groundwater showed relatively high DOC. The DON and DIN fluxes through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in the groundwater of Hwasun Bay were estimated to be 1.3 x 10(5) and 2.9 x 10(5) mol d(-1), respectively. In the seawater of Hwasun Bay, the groundwater-origin DON was almost conservative while about 91% of the groundwater-origin DIN was removed perhaps due to biological production. The DON flux from the entire Jeju was estimated to be 7.9 x 10(8) mol yr(-1), which is comparable to some of the world's large rivers. Thus, our study highlights that DON flux through SGD is potentially important for delivery of organic nitrogen to further offshore while DIN is readily utilized by marine plankton in near-shore waters under N-limited conditions.

The results showed that four types of dissolved organic carbon (DOM) fluorescence peaks were observed in the water: humic-like fluorescence peak A and C, and protein-like fluorescence peak B and D. Fluorescent substances mainly existed in the truly dissolved organic matter (UOM, <1 kDa), secondly in low and medium molecular weight of colloidal organic matter (1 similar to 500 kDa). Protein of DOM in water mainly originated from anthropogenic sources, then from autochthonous sources. Compared to protein, humic acid of DOM in wet season was both terrigenous and autochthonous sources, while in dry season mainly from terrestrial organic matter. In addition, humic acid in UOM was mainly derived from biological decomposition, however, in colloidal organic matter (COM) came from terrestrial organic matter and was affected by resuspension effects. There was linear correlation between fluorescence intensity and environmental parameters. It was revealed that the complex environmental conditions would influence the fluorescent substance of DOM in water from Yangtze River estuary.																	1000-0593					APR	2013	33	4					1000	1004		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2013)04-1000-05						WOS:000317634400030

In order to probe possible DOM binding mechanisms and their consequences for contaminant detection and quantification in natural waters, a set of laboratory experiments was conducted with aqueous solutions containing various operationally-defined "hydrophilic" and "hydrophobic" freshwater DOM fractions isolated by resin adsorption techniques from reference Suwannee River natural organic matter (SROM). Per unit mass of SROM carbon, hydrophobic acids (HoA) comprised the largest C fraction (0.63 +/- 0.029), followed by hydrophilic-neutrals (HiN, 0.11 +/- 0.01) and acids (HiA, 0.09 +/- 0.017). Aqueous solutions comprising 8 mg L-1 DOC of each SROM fraction were spiked with a concentration range (10-1000 mu g L-1) of bisphenol A (BPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), or ibuprofen (IBU) as model target compounds in 24 mM NH4HCO3 background electrolyte at pH 7.4. Contaminant interaction with the SROM fractions was probed using fluorescence spectroscopy, and effects on quantitative analysis of the target compounds were measured using direct aqueous-injection liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Total quenching was greater for the hydrophilic fractions of SROM and associations were principally with protein-like and fulvic acid-like constituents. Whereas LC-MS/MS recoveries indicated relatively weak interactions with most SROM factions, an important exception was the HiA fraction, which diminished recovery of CBZ and IBU by ca. 30% and 70%, respectively, indicating relatively strong molecular interactions.

J	Kim, TH; Kim, G				Kim, Tae-Hoon; Kim, Guebuem			Factors controlling the C:N:P stoichiometry of dissolved organic matter in the N-limited, cyanobacteria-dominated East/Japan Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The vertical and horizontal distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP), together with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), phosphorus (DIP), silicate (DSi), and photosynthetic pigments, were measured in the euphotic layer (0-100 m) along the south-north transect of the East/Japan Sea (EJS) in May 2007. In the mixed layer, the DIN concentrations were lower than 3 mu M, and the DIN:DIP ratios were lower than 10. Under this DIN-limited condition, cyanobacteria (20-65%) and diatoms (20-50%) dominated the phytoplankton community. The concentrations of DOC (60-83 mu M) and DOP (0.1-0.4 mu M) in the EJS fell into a range similar to those found in the major oceans, whereas the concentration of DON (2-7 mu M) was lower than that in the Pacific Ocean (7-13 mu M). The correlation analyses showed that the distributions of DOC, DON, and DOP in the study region were affected mainly by the physical characteristics of water masses. The lower DON concentrations, higher DOC:DON ratios, and lower DON:DOP ratios in the EJS, relative to the major oceans, together with a strong negative correlation between the concentrations DON and zeaxanthin, suggest that DON is preferentially taken up by cyanobacteria in this environment. Thus, our results show that the C:N:P stoichiometty of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the EJS is controlled mainly by the physical and biological characteristics of water masses.

J	Wang, CK; Zhang, XJ; Chen, C; Wang, J				Wang, Chengkun; Zhang, Xiaojian; Chen, Chao; Wang, Jun			Factors controlling N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation from dissolved organic matter	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												The formation of cancinogenic nitrosamines, esp. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in water and wastewater treatment plants has drawn much attention in recent years. Dissolved organic matter from the transported Luan River water as water source of Tianjin was fractionated with different XAD resins and a series of ultra-filtration membranes with molecular weight (MW) cut-offs of 5k Da, 3k Da, and 1k Da, respectively. The NDMA yields from the raw water and each fraction were measured to investigate their role in NDMAyield. Results indicated that the hydrophilic fraction had a higher NDMA yield than those of hydrophobic fraction and transphilic fraction. The fraction with MW below 1k Da had a higher NDMAyield than that with larger MW. NDMA formation increased as the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) ratio decreased, which indicated that DON might serve as the real important precursor for NDMA. The correlation between NDMA yield and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) suggested that the latter might not represent the specific precursors for NDMA in the water. Besides the water quality, the influences of pH, disinfectant dosage, and disinfection contact time on the formation of NDMA were also examined. These results will help water treatment plants establish measures to control this harmful disinfection by-product.

Estimation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and photosynthetic activity of estuarine phytoplankton using a multiple-fixed-wavelength spectral fluorometer	WATER RESEARCH												The utility of a multiple-fixed-wavelength spectral fluorometer, the Algae Online Analyser (AOA), as a means of quantifying chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and phytoplankton photosynthetic activity was tested using algal cultures and natural communities from North Inlet estuary, South Carolina. Comparisons of AOA measurements of CDOM to those by spectrophotometry showed a significant linear relationship, but increasing amounts of background CDOM resulted in progressively higher over-estimates of chromophyte contributions to a simulated mixed algal community. Estimates of photosynthetic activity by the AOA at low irradiance (similar to 80 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) agreed well with analogous values from the literature for the chlorophyte, Dunaliella tertiolecta, but were substantially lower than previous measurements of the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m) in Thalassiosira weissflogii (a diatom) and Rhodomonas salina (a cryptophyte). When cells were exposed to high irradiance (1500 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)), declines in photosynthetic activity with time measured by the AOA mirrored estimates of cellular fluorescence capacity using the herbicide 3'-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1',1'-dimethyl urea (DCMU). The AOA shows promise as a tool for the continuous monitoring of phytoplankton community composition, CDOM, and the group-specific photosynthetic activity of aquatic ecosystems.

Assessment of dissolved organic matter fluorescence PARAFAC components before and after coagulation-filtration in a full scale water treatment plant	WATER RESEARCH												techniques. These results support the analysis of the PARAFAC components present in the raw and treated samples as a viable measure for assessment of the coagulation process in a drinking water treatment plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Fluorescence monitoring of the raw and treated water after coagulation filtration in a drinking water treatment plant in Northeast Ohio was conducted during a period of 32 months. Principal fluorophore groups present in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) of the raw, treated, raw-treated combined water and differential fluorescence data sets comprising over 680 samples were determined through Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Four components (two humic-like and two with protein nature) were identified in each model and their degree of similarity was evaluated using the Uncorrected Matrix Correlation (UMC), a measure of spectral overlapping. Results show that spectral characteristics of the components in the independent models are comparable (average UMC > 0.98), indicating that from a PARAFAC perspective, components in the raw water are not experiencing major transformations beyond removal through the treatment process and new fluorescent components are not being formed. Coagulation assessment based on PARAFAC application to the differential excitation-emission matrices (Delta EEM), representing the portion of fluorescence removed after treatment, is introduced in this paper along with the volumetric evaluation of the components present in a sample as an alternative approach to determine their relative contribution. Volumetric analysis revealed a predominance of humic components, constituting about 80% in the raw and treated water. Results of the SEEM model indicated that the most amenable component to be removed by coagulation (removal similar to 50%) at full scale operation is a humic-like fluorophore with predominance in the raw water, while removal of the protein-like components was about 30%. Results also show that the PARAFAC sample loadings exhibit a higher association with the total EEM signal in the raw and treated water samples when compared with alternative analysis techniques. These results support the analysis of the PARAFAC components present in the raw and treated samples as a viable measure for assessment of the coagulation process in a drinking water treatment plant.

Contribution of ferric iron to light absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study experimentally determined the contribution of ferric iron (Fe(III)) associated with humic substances (HS) to light absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The associations between Fe(III) and HS (HS-Fe) were generated by mixing HS standards with Fe(III) in acidic conditions and adjusting pH to 8. HS-associated Fe was separated from total Fe by filtering (0.7 mu m and 0.2 mu m filters) and by removing the free Fe ions by cation exchange chromatography. The maximum Fe-binding capacities (at pH 8) of Suwannee River humic acid, Suwannee River fulvic acid, and Pony Lake (Antarctica) fulvic acid were 13.0, 13.5, and 7.64 mu mol Fe [mg C](-1), respectively, indicating that wetland-derived HS had a higher Fe-binding capacity than plankton-derived HS. HS-associated Fe increased the absorption coefficient of CDOM by up to several fold in the visible range of the spectrum and reduced the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM. The Fe-induced increase in light absorption was spectrally similar among different HS examined. The Fe-specific absorption coefficient spectrum for HS-associated Fe (a(lambda,Fe)*) was calculated from the Fe-induced increase in light absorption by normalizing it with the concentration of Fe in the HS pool. The a(lambda,Fe)* was adopted in estimation of the contribution of HS-associated Fe to light absorption by CDOM in 13 circum-neutral natural waters collected from a spring, 10 major rivers, a lake, and a coastal area. HS-associated Fe was calculated to be responsible for from 0.6% (Mississippi River) to 56.4% (Loytynlahde spring) of light absorption by CDOM at a wavelength of 410 nm. This study shows that HS-associated Fe can be an important component in light absorption by CDOM and also influence the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM.																	0024-3590					MAR	2013	58	2					653	662		10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0653						WOS:000317954300018

New insights on the mineralization of dissolved organic matter in central, intermediate, and deep water masses of the northeast North Atlantic	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An optimum multiparameter (OMP) analysis was applied to samples collected during a cruise in the northeast North Atlantic with the aim of objectively defining water mass realms and calculating water mass mixing-weighted average (archetypal) concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). The profile of archetypal DOC, which retains the basin-scale variability from the formation area of the water masses to the study area, was modeled with a constant initial concentration of 60 +/- 1 mu mol kg(-1) that decreased linearly with increasing apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) at a rate of -0.20 +/- 0.03 mol C per mol of AOU. The archetypal C:N ratio of dissolved organic matter was also modeled with a constant initial molar ratio of 11.5 +/- 0.4 that increased at a rate of 0.06 +/- 0.01 per mu mol kg(-1) of AOU. The profile of archetypal FDOM was modeled with a constant initial humic-like fluorescence of 0.54 +/- 0.07 quinine sulfate units that increased at a rate of 0.009 +/- 0.001 g equivalent of quinine sulphate per mol of AOU. Only the Denmark Strait Overflow Water departed from this behavior because of the marked terrestrial influence of Arctic rivers during the formation of this water mass. The variability not explained by the archetypal concentrations, which retain the local variability, suggesting that N-poor DOM was mineralized in the study area, and that the efficiency of the local production of humic-like substances was directly proportional to the ventilation of the corresponding water mass realms.

The type, distribution and origin of the fluorescence dissolved organic matter were also discussed. Three fluorescent components were identified by PARAFAC, including protein-like component C1(235, 280/330), terrestrial or marine humic-like component C2(255, 330/400) and terrestrial humic-like component C3(275, 360/480). The good linearity of the two humic-like components showed the same source or some relationship between the chemical constitutions. As a whole, the level of the fluorescence intensity in coastal ocean was higher than that of the open ocean in different water layers in two seasons. The relationship of three components with chlorophyll-a and salinity showed the DOM in the study area is almost not influenced by the living algal matter, but the fresh water outflow of the Yangtze River might be the source of them in the Yangtze River estuary in Summer. From what has been discussed above, we can draw the conclusion that the application of EEM-PARAFAC modeling will exert a profound influence upon the research of the dissolved organic matter.																	1000-0593					MAR	2013	33	3					653	658		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2013)03-0653-06						WOS:000317439900016

Batch tests were conducted first to optimize the individual ozone and US pretreatments. Maximum sludge reduction ratios of 10.89% and 23% were obtained at 0.15 g O-3/g total solids ozone dose and 1.5 W/mL US energy density, respectively. The combined ozone and US pretreatments were studied using response surface methodology. A maximum sludge reduction ratio of 40.14% was achieved by the combined ozone/US pretreatment with an ozone dose of 0.154 g O-3/g total solids and an US energy density of 1.445 W/mL. The analysis of the dissolved organic matter by three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the combined pretreatment was superior to the individual ozone and US pretreatments, and also demonstrated the synergetic effect of these two combined pretreatments.

Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter and Dissolved Organic Carbon from Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and MERIS Sensors: Case Study for the Northern Gulf of Mexico	REMOTE SENSING												Empirical band ratio algorithms for the estimation of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and MERIS ocean color sensors were assessed and developed for the northern Gulf of Mexico. Match-ups between in situ measurements of CDOM absorption coefficients at 412 nm (a(CDOM)(412)) with that derived from SeaWiFS were examined using two previously reported reflectance band ratio algorithms. Results indicate better performance using the R-rs(510)/R-rs(555) (Bias = -0.045; RMSE = 0.23; SI = 0.49, and R-2 = 0.66) than the R-rs(490)/R-rs(555) reflectance band ratio algorithm. Further, a comparison of a(CDOM)(412) retrievals using the R-rs(488)/R-rs(555) for MODIS and R-rs(510)/R-rs(560) for MERIS reflectance band ratios revealed better CDOM retrievals with MERIS data. Since DOC cannot be measured directly by remote sensors, CDOM as the colored component of DOC is utilized as a proxy to estimate DOC remotely. A seasonal relationship between CDOM and DOC was established for the summer and spring-winter with high correlation for both periods (R-2 similar to 0.9). Seasonal band ratio empirical algorithms to estimate DOC were thus developed using the relationships between CDOM-R-rs and seasonal CDOM-DOC for SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS. Results of match-up comparisons revealed DOC estimates by both MODIS and MERIS to be relatively more accurate during summer time, while both of them underestimated DOC during spring-winter time. A better DOC estimate from MERIS in comparison to MODIS in spring-winter could be attributed to its similarity with the SeaWiFS band ratio CDOM algorithm.																	2072-4292					MAR	2013	5	3					1439	1464		10.3390/rs5031439						WOS:000316612000022

Seasonality and landscape factors drive dissolved organic matter properties in Mediterranean ephemeral washes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY					4th Conference on the Mechanisms of Organic Matter Stabilization and Destabilization (SOM) - Organic Matter Stabilization and Ecosystem Functions	SEP 19-23, 2010	FRANCE	Bioemco Lab (Biogeochemistry and Ecol Continental Ecosystems), Soil Organ Matter Grp				Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) is a fundamental component of the aquatic carbon cycle and a key driver of the biogeochemical interactions between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The origin, properties and role of DOM are increasingly characterised in lakes, rivers and streams, but little is known about DOM characteristics in ephemeral washes, which are the most common water flows in Mediterranean landscapes. Here, we examine the patterns in the optical properties of DOM in ephemeral washes draining a small catchment in the island of Menorca, Western Mediterranean. We used concentration data (dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen) and several spectroscopic descriptors (SUVA(254), absorption coefficient at 440 nm, fluorescence index, and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices) to assess changes in DOM concentrations and quality at both seasonal and spatial scales. Two periods were clearly distinguished in the DOM properties: autumn and winter-spring. In autumn, which includes the first flows of the hydrological year, DOM showed an aromatic character and was spatially homogenous over the catchment. In winter-spring, DOM was smaller and recently produced, and a considerable spatial heterogeneity was observed in all descriptors. The variability in DOM concentrations and quality was driven by hydromorphology and by the landscape features of the catchment, but the influence of these drivers on DOM properties changed along the hydrological year. In autumn, hydromorphology was the main factor determining DOM properties, whereas in winter-spring the land uses in the watershed highly determined the observed differences in DOM quality between subcatchments.

These wetlands are threatened due to climate change, sea level rise, and coastal urban development. Understanding the natural biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in these forested wetlands as ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen processing can provide important benchmarks to guide conservation plans and restoration goals. In this study, surface water and soil pore water samples were collected weekly from a cypress-tupelo wetland near Winyah Bay, South Carolina and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen, and phosphate during its flooding period between October 2010 and May 2011. DOC was further characterized by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio (S-R) (ratio of two spectral slopes between 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm), E2/E3 ratio (ratio between A254 and A365), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. In addition, litterfall was collected on a monthly basis for a year while the biomass of the detritus layer (i.e., decomposed duff lying on the wetland floor) was determined before and after the flooding period. Results of the field study showed that concentrations of DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N in the surface water were generally higher during the fall, or peak litterfall season (October to December), than in the spring season (March to May). Highest concentrations of 54.8, 1.48, 0.270, and 0.0205 mg L-1, for DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N respectively, in surface waters were recorded during October. Lower SUVA, but higher S-R and E2/E3 ratios of DOC, were observed at the end of the flooding season comparing to the initial flooding, suggesting the wetland system converts high aromatic and large DOC molecules into smaller and hydrophilic fractions possibly through photochemical oxidation. A similar trend was observed in soil pore water, but the pore water generally had greater and relatively stable concentrations of dissolved nutrients than surface water. No obvious temporal trend in phosphate concentration and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N:P) were found. Results of the laboratory extraction and mass balance calculation suggested fresh litter was a major source of DOC whereas decomposed duff was the source of dissolved nitrogen in surface water. In summary, the biogeochemistry of this isolated cypress-tupelo wetland is not only driven by the vegetation within the wetland system but also by hydrology and weather conditions such as groundwater table position, precipitation, and temperature.

J	Chen, H; Zheng, BH				Chen, Hao; Zheng, Binghui			Sources of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in high salinity seawater (Bohai Bay, China)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) identified in coastal waters within a large salinity range had been widely reported in previous studies, which stated that conservative mixing of terrestrially derived and river-transported FDOM by clear seawaters could account for the relatively low FDOM fluorescence signals in high salinity seawaters. This study aimed at testing the conservative mixing model in high salinity seawaters in a shallow bay (Bohai Bay, China) with low river flow in a dry season. The water showed high salinities varying in a narrow range (30.52 -aEuro parts per thousand 2.07), and salinity effects on fluorescence quantum yields therefore less likely introduced complications to fluorescence data analyses. By applying a parallel factor analysis to fluorescence excitation emission matrices of the water samples, we identified a tyrosine-like FDOM component, a tryptophan-like FDOM component, and two humic substances-like FDOM components. Based on a theoretical analysis, we found that dissolved organic carbon concentrations and suspended solid concentrations of the bulk-water samples as well as the maximum fluorescence signals of each identified FDOM component showed spatial distributions that could not be accounted for by the conservative mixing model. Marine autochthonous processes including microbial activities and FDOM releasing from resuspended sediment were likely to be invoked.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2013	20	3					1762	1771		10.1007/s11356-012-1085-8						WOS:000315442500052	22821280

The photolysis of a higher chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl, PCB 153) under simulated sunlight in presence of humic acid (HA) was investigated. Degradation of PCB 153 was accelerated significantly by the addition of HA, with a rate constant of 0.0214, 0.0413, and 0.0358 h(-1) in the initial 18 h of irradiation in presence of 1, 5, and 20 mg/L HA, respectively. The main photodegradation products analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry were 4-hydroxy-2,2',4',5,5'-pentaCB and 2,4,5-trichlorobenzoic acid. Main reactive species involved were determined by the electron spin-resonance spectroscopy, including O-1(2) and (OH)-O-aEuro cent. Special scavengers were added to elucidate the photolysis mechanisms. By using the specific scavengers, it turned out that (OH)-O-aEuro cent accounted for 29.3 % of the degradation, and the intra-DOM reactive species (O-1(2), (OH)-O-aEuro cent, and (DOM)-D-3*) accounted for 59.6 % of the degradation. Photo-transformation sensitized by DOM, which involves both aqueous and intra-DOM reactions of PCBs with reactive species, may be one of the most important mechanisms for natural attenuation of PCBs.

Temporal succession of putative glycolate-utilizing bacterioplankton tracks changes in dissolved organic matter in a high-elevation lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Shifts in the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be a principal factor effecting changes in bacterial community composition. Emerald Lake, a high-elevation lake with DOM dominated by terrestrial sources in the spring with increasing phytoplankton-derived inputs throughout the ice-free season, provided a natural experiment with which to investigate the importance of resource-mediated drivers. Glycolate-utilizing bacteria, a subset of the bacterial community able to use algal exudates, were characterized using DNA analysis of glycolate oxidase subunit D (glcD) genes from Emerald Lake samples collected approximately biweekly from ice-cover (June) through fall turnover (September). glcD genes were not detected in early-season samples when the lake was ice-covered and phytoplankton-derived resources were scarce. Following this period, glcD gene composition exhibited significant changes through time, which were strongly correlated with the combination of fluorescence index, an indicator of the proportion of lake vs. terrestrially derived DOM, and dissolved inorganic nitrate+nitrite. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in DOM source and environmental variables that affect the composition of algal-derived dissolved resources drive changes in the relative abundance and composition of putative glycolate-utilizing bacteria. These findings strengthen the evidence for shifts in DOM structuring bacterial communities.

J	Guo, XJ; Yuan, DH; Jiang, JY; Zhang, H; Deng, Y				Guo, Xu-jing; Yuan, Dong-hai; Jiang, Jin-yuan; Zhang, Hui; Deng, Yu			Detection of dissolved organic matter in saline-alkali soils using synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and principal component analysis	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is attributed a key role in soil major biogeochemical processes. Its molecular characteristics can reflect both its source and its biogeochemical history. Saline-alkali soil samples were collected from a field in desert and semi-desert region. DOM was analyzed by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of synchronous fluorescence spectra was used to detect and describe changes in the DOM in different soil profiles. The analysis of PCA yielded 2 PCs that account for 97% of the variance. DOM is characterized by a dominant tyrosine-like fluorophore in the Region I (PC1 > 0.9, PC2 < 0.3), including soils Ke02, Ke03, Ke04, Rh02, Rh03, Rh04, Sa04 and Sc04. The region II including Kf02, Sa01, Yb01, Yzd01 and Yzd02 obtain higher PC2 (>0.9) and lower PC1 (<0.3) loading, which is dominated humic-like fluorophore. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) identified five main clusters. The results of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were consistent with the PCA. The ratio of fluorescence intensity of humic substances at long wavelengths and short wavelengths was used to indicate the humification of organic matter. Two ratios (I-345/318 and I-362/318.) can be used to indicate the humification of DOM. The humification degree of the remaining soils has no systematic trend because of land use, agricultural irrigation, soil erosion and salinization. Soils obtained a relatively high humification degree in the region II and a relatively low humification degree in the region I. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hong, Y; Song, H; Karanfil, T				Hong, Ying; Song, Hocheol; Karanfil, Tanju			Formation of haloacetic acids from dissolved organic matter fractions during chloramination	WATER RESEARCH												The objective of this study was to investigate the roles of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions, pH and bromide concentration in the formation of haloacetic acids (HAA) during chloramination. DOM from two surface waters with a low (2.9 L/mg-m) and high (5.1 L/mg-m) specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) values was isolated and fractionated into three fractions based on the hydrophobicity [i.e., hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPH) and hydrophilic (HPI)]. DOM mass balances and DBP reactivity checks were performed to characterize the effects of isolation and fractionation steps. The fractions were chloraminated at three pHs and three bromide concentrations. The results showed that pH was the most important factor controlling HAA formation and speciation. The HAA yields significantly decreased with increase in pH from 6.3 to 9.0. The impact of bromide in the formation of brominated HAA species also became less important with increasing pH, and no brominated specie was detectable at pH 9. HPO fractions of the two source waters consistently showed higher HAA yields than TPH and HPI fractions. On the other hand, HPI fractions showed higher bromine incorporation than HPO and TPH fractions. To maintain higher and relatively stable combined chlorine residuals while reducing HAA formation, water utilities may consider keeping pH above 7.5 as one strategy. This will also lower the formation of brominated HAA species which have been shown to be more cyto- and geno-toxic than their chlorinated analogs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Biodegradability of natural dissolved organic matter collected from a UK moorland stream	WATER RESEARCH												The fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported from headwaters is a large uncertainty in global carbon models and catchment biogeochemical process understanding. We examined the biodegradability of stream DOM collected during different flow conditions (n = 12) from a heather-dominated moorland headwater in NE Scotland. Freeze-dried DOM isolates were characterised, re-dissolved to 10 mg C L-1, inoculated with indigenous stream sediment microbes and incubated, with and without added nutrients, to assess decomposition rates at different times up to 41 days. Biodegradable DOM ranged from 5.0 to 19% of the total transported DOM, representing 8.54 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (11.1% of the total DOC flux, calculated as 77.2 +/- 39.0 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). No simple patterns with flow rate were apparent but accumulated antecedent rainfall, specific UV absorbance of DOM and N-15 content were significant predictors of the proportion of organic matter decomposed. In headwater streams draining organic-rich catchments, in-stream DOM decomposition processes act as a secondary control on the spatial variability of carbon species, and are important for establishing accuracy of aquatic carbon fluxes and cycling budgets. Moreover, biologically-mediated DOM decomposition represents a net 'climate forcing effect' via the soil-stream-atmosphere pathway, drives downstream ecosystem metabolism and should be incorporated in carbon predictive modelling and ecosystem process studies.

In this work, reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) with fluorescence detector (FLD) were used for EEM interpretation and DOM analysis. Given that fluorescence detectors can scan with multi-excitation or multi-emission mode, HPLC-FLD with multi-excitation scan directly verified the prevalence of multi-peak fluorophores in EEM, which provides a corrective insight for the current fluorescence regional integration (FRI) methods; whereas HPLC-FLD with multi-emission scan provided more informative fluorescence fingerprints for identification of DOM species, which is a chromatographic surrogate for determining the proper number of PARAFAC components. Besides providing a deep insight for the current EEM interpretation, the HPLC/HPSEC-FLD results also directly related physiochemical properties to DOM species, including polarity and molecular weight (MW) distribution, which is helpful for further characterization their behavior in water and wastewater treatment process. A chromatography technique with multi-excitation and multi-emission fluorescence scan can be an informative method for EEM interpretation and DOM identification and characterization.

Variations in spectroscopic characteristics and disinfection byproduct formation potentials of dissolved organic matter for two contrasting storm events	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Changes in disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors during storm events have not been intensively studied to date despite their dramatic impact on downstream drinking water supplies. For this study, variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM) spectroscopic properties and DBP formation potentials (DBPFPs), and the correlations among these various parameters, were investigated in river water samples collected under two contrasting storm event conditions (a strong summer storm versus a weak fall event). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) combined with parallel factor analysis revealed that a combination of two humic-like components (C1 and C2) dominated the EEM data of the storm samples. Measured DOM characteristics and DBPFPs varied over a wider range during the more intense summer storm, exhibiting higher values of specific ultraviolet absorbance and C1/C2 ratio at high flow conditions. Variations in the fluorescence index were less pronounced during the two storm events. The spectroscopic changes were well explained by the input of terrestrial DOM sources from the surrounding catchments during the storms. Different trends of the formation potentials for trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids on the recession limb of the hydrographs suggest that the structures responsible for DBP precursors during storm events may not be the same for the two classes of DBPs. The ultraviolet light-absorbing moieties in DOM appear to play major roles in generating DBPs, as evidenced by their strong positive correlations with DBPFPs. Higher correlations with DBPFP for C1 versus C2 suggest that humic-like substances associated with more aromatic and condensed structures have a greater proclivity to generate DBP upon chlorination.

Changes in compound specific delta N-15 amino acid signatures and D/L ratios in marine dissolved organic matter induced by heterotrophic bacterial reworking	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Compound-specific delta N-15 analysis of individual amino acids (delta N-15-AA) represents a potentially important new tool which may reveal the molecular-level basis for ON signature of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the ocean, as well indicate DON sources and specific mechanisms of alteration. Past work has indicated that delta N-15-AA may be effective at indicating the effects of microbial heterotrophy, however the influence of bacterial degradation on delta N-15-AA patterns has never been directly investigated. Here we measured molecular-level changes in delta N-15-AA patterns in freshly produced algal high molecular weight (HMW) DON due to heterotrophic bacterial reworking, together with linked changes in enantiomeric (D vs. L) AA ratios and also the AA molar percentage-based degradation index (DI). Our results show a strong increase in degradation with microbial consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), consistent with previous studies. The delta N-15-AA data show systematically higher delta N-15 values for most individual AA after DOC bacterial reworking, resulting in average increases of 3-6 parts per thousand in delta N-15 of total proteinaceous material. The average deviation in the delta N-15 values of all AA (Sigma V parameter) also increased with degradation, indicating an increase in delta N-15-AA pattern complexity, most likely due to selected microbial resynthesis of specific AA. These results show that delta N-15-AA patterns have the ability to directly track the effects of microbial resynthesis in DON. They indicate that delta N-15-AA represents a highly specific tracer that provides independent, and yet strongly complimentary, information vs. existing AA-based degradation indicators. Together, our data suggests that heterotrophic microbial degradation in the ocean would be expected to increase delta N-15 values of the oceanic DON pool vs. autotrophic sources. This conclusion is consistent with recent results on delta N-15 signatures of total and HMWDON pool in the open sea, however it also strongly implicates bacterial sources as the likely mechanism for delta N-15-DON changes. Reevaluating existing DON isotopic data in light of these results may improve our understanding of the influence and mechanism of bacterial reworking on DON long-term preservation in the marine water column.

J	Chappaz, A; Curtis, PJ				Chappaz, Anthony; Curtis, P. Jeff			Integrating Empirically Dissolved Organic Matter Quality for WHAM VI using the DOM Optical Properties: A Case Study of Cu-Al-DOM Interactions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Metal speciation is important for understanding the toxicity of metals in aquatic systems, and can be predicted for mixtures of metals in presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with thermodynamic models such as WHAM VI. The influence of the DOM source (quality) has been demonstrated, but is presently neglected in predicting Cu activity (WHAM VI). Here we determined the effect of aluminum (Al) competition on copper (Cu) complexation for four different DOMs, from a high-colored DOM (more humic) to a low-colored DOM (less humic). In presence of Al, free Cu activities (defined as free ion activity) increased, consistent with competition between Cu and Al for the same binding sites on all DOM. The apparent competition decreased with increasing DOM color. Equilibrium modeling of Cu speciation with WHAM VI explained 49% of the variance in measured Cu activity. When modified to integrate DOM quality using a new empirical coefficient F related to DOM optical properties, Cu activities predicted from WHAM VI were significantly improved to about 80% of the observed variance explained. The effects of Al on Cu activity were well predicted by WHAM VI. Subsequently, we compared the relative effects of DOM concentration, DOM quality, and Al competition with other determinants of Cu activity represented in legislation and scientific literature (pH and hardness), and qualitatively ranked them by their influence on Cu activity for normal ranges encountered in fresh waters using WHAM VI. Our experimental results indicate that DOM quality is an important variable that should be included in predictive models of ion speciation (WHAM VI) and eco-toxicological models such as the biotic ligand model (BLM).																	0013-936X					FEB 19	2013	47	4					2001	2007		10.1021/es3022045						WOS:000315326700028	23331061

After the MFC treatment, the total organic carbon concentration in the raw lake water was reduced by 50%, the physicochemical nature of DOMs was substantially altered. Protein-like substances in lake water were utilized as a major substrate for the MFC, while humic-like substances were refractory to the biodegradation. A further investigation into the bovine serum albumin utilization in an MFC confirms that the electricity generation was closely associated with the removal of protein-like substrates. Toxicity assessment by Salmonella typhimurium Sa194 indicates that the genotoxic agents in the polluted lake water were almost completely removed after the MFC treatment. This approach of coupling microbially-catalyzed electricity generation with DOM removal may offer a potential avenue for energy-efficient bioremediation of lake water. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The canal has been contaminated with treated and untreated wastewater from communities, agricultural processes, and industrial activities. Water samples were collected 3 times from an intake point of the water treatment plant located downstream of the canal. We found an average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of 7.4 mg/l and a THMFP of 630 mu g/l in the raw water. We also found a DOCHPO of 3.3 mg/l, a DOCHPI of 3.7 mg/l, a THMFPHPO of 281 mu g/l, and a THMEPHPI of 348 mu g/l. Strong fluorescent peaks of tryptophan-like and humic and fulvic acid-like substances were detected in the raw water. The optimal condition of polyaluminium chloride (PACl) coagulation for removing dissolved organic matter was obtained at a PACl of 40 mg/l at pH 7. Under such conditions, it could reduce the average DOC to 55% and THMFP to 48%. The PACl coagulation reduced the fluorescent intensity of humic and fulvic acid-like substances more than tryptophan-like substances. The best reduction observed of DOC was 76% and THMFP was 83%; this was obtained by using a PACl of 40 mg/l with 1 mg/l of polymer and 80 mg/l of powder activated carbon. Under such conditions, there was consistent removal of an average DOCHPO, DOCHPI, THMFPHPO, and THMFPHPI by 85, 68, 81, and 79%, respectively. Such a condition was capable of reducing trihalomethanes to meet the World Health Organization standards.				inthanuchit, kamonnawin/J-9425-2014	inthanuchit, kamonnawin/0000-0001-6802-0364												1513-1874					FEB	2013	39	1					56	66		10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2013.39.056						WOS:000324222400008

Tea infusions are rich in DOM that show benefit impact on human health. In this study, electron transfer capacities (ETC) of tea-derived DOM (TDOM) were characterized with respect to the extent of fermentation. It appeared that the DOM originated from non-fermented and partially fermented tea had higher ETC values than those of fully fermentated tea. The electron acceptor capacity (EAC) values were ranged from 257 similar to 428 mu mol(e-) (g.C)(-1) and the EDC values were in the range of 17 similar to 38 mu mol(e-) (g.C)(-1) in the order: oolong tea > green tea > black tea > pu-erh. The electrochemical features of TDOM were proven to be correlated with its chemical structures. Element analysis, fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3DEEM) revealed the abundance of aromatic and phenolic compounds in four tea samples, but their components differed in response to the manufacturing process. The fluorescence intensities of a peak at 370 similar to 390/460 similar to 470 nM (excitation (Ex)/emission (Em)) varied in the same trend as the ETC of all TDOM. Meanwhile, the same trend appeared in the TDOM -stimulated microbial reduction of iron(III) oxide, in which the TDOM acted as the electron shuttles to transfer electrons from the Fe(III)-reducing bacteria to the iron oxide. The results of the work provided potential biogeochemical implication of TDOM in natural environmental, which was the additional function of tea organic matters apart from benefiting human health.				yuan, yong/B-1042-2010													1452-3981					FEB	2013	8	2					2566	2575								WOS:000316565800087		
J	Wang, LX; Lv, DA; Yan, BX; Zhang, YB				Wang, Lixia; Lv, Duian; Yan, Baixing; Zhang, Yubin			Fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter during composting at low carbon/nitrogen ratios	WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH												We investigated the composting of swine manure at low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios (about 13). The purpose was to elucidate organic matter transformation during composting by means of chemical and spectral methods. Swine manure was composted with two bulking agents (rice straw and leaves) at a ratio of 2: 1 (manure: bulking agent; v: v) respectively. Low initial C/N ratios (about 13) did not prevent the swine manure from composting, which would greatly decrease the usage of bulking agent. A high organic matter mineralization rate was observed in the co-composting of straw and manure paired with a high maximum temperature and long thermophilic phase. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra were also used to monitor the component changes in the dissolved organic matter. Fluorescence parameters, including peak location, peak intensity, the ratio of peak intensity and fluorescence regional integration, were displayed and discussed as the maturity index. The fluorescence regional integration, showing higher correlation coefficient than the fluorescence intensity peaks, could be used as a valuable tool for assessing compost maturity.																	0734-242X					FEB	2013	31	2					203	211		10.1177/0734242X12468195						WOS:000316635100011	23179510	
J	Zhang, YL; Liu, XH; Wang, MZ; Qin, BQ				Zhang, Yunlin; Liu, Xiaohan; Wang, Mingzhu; Qin, Boqiang			Compositional differences of chromophoric dissolved organic matter derived from phytoplankton and macrophytes	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important component in the aquatic environment and plays a key role in light attenuation and in carbon biogeochemical cycles. We examined CDOM production in each of two laboratory experiments in which phytoplankton and macrophyte degradation were monitored using absorption and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEMs). During the incubation period, CDOM was produced from phytoplankton and macrophytes, and partly decomposed by microorganisms. The absorption spectra of the phytoplankton derived and the macrophyte derived CDOM were distinct and characterized by peaks and shoulders in the UV bands. Production of CDOM absorption at 350 nm, a(350), was 0.0125 m(2)/g per unit of chlorophyll a from phytoplankton CDOM from 0-3 d. Meanwhile a(350) production was 2.708 x 10(-4) m(2)/g per unit of wet biomass from macrophytes CDOM from 1-7 d. Despite the high production of CDOM by phytoplankton and macrophytes, extrapolation of these values to the field indicated that about 15% of total CDOM was produced from phytoplankton during algal blooms in Meiliang Bay in summer and about 8% of total CDOM was produced from macrophytes in the macrophyte dominated littorals. The mean value of the spectral slope (S) describing the exponential decrease of the absorption spectrum, which was strongly correlated to an optical index of molecular size, for the phytoplankton derived CDOM was 10.26 +/- 2.05 mu m(-1), which was significantly lower than the mean S of 14.47 +/- 2.88 mu m(-1) for the macrophyte derived CDOM (t-test, p < 0.001). The mean value of the spectral slope ratio (S-R) for the phytoplankton derived CDOM was 1.79 +/- 0.52, which was significantly higher than that of 0.35 +/- 0.58 for the macrophyte derived CDOM (t-test, p < 0.001). Three fluorescent components were validated in parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) models calculated separately for phytoplankton derived and macrophyte derived CDOM, each CDOM source resulting in distinct excitation and emission maxima for each component. The significant differences in CDOM absorption spectra, S, S-R and PARAFAC fluorescence component characteristics, all showed that phytoplankton derived CDOM was compositionally distinct from macrophyte derived CDOM. Overall both sources were important to the CDOM pool in the shallow temperate lake. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The arsenic contamination in water forced the water and health authorities to introduce stringent standards for arsenic control level in drinking water. Nanofiltration presents a promising method to remove arsenic, by the effect of both size exclusion and electric repulse, which is reliable, easy to produce, obtain, operate, and maintain. In this work, the influences of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on arsenic removal by nanofiltration process were investigated through a series of laboratory bench-level experiments. The existing of humic acid (HA), which was used as substitute of DOM, increased the arsenic removal due to the formation of humic/arsenic complexes. With the presence of high concentration of HA (10mg total organic carbon [ TOC]/L), the removal efficiency of arsenic was almost 100%, which was higher compared with the result (80%) obtained at low concentration of HA (2mg TOC/L). The membrane flux for the membrane separation of the various concentration of DOM decreased to 80% of the initial flux after 400 min with the same cross-flow velocity (3.5 cm/s). The mechanism of arsenic removal by nanofiltration was further presented article.

The highest removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen have been achieved when the 1/3 effluent of biological contact oxidation reactor was backflow into the reactor of hydrolytic acidification. It was found that the concentrations of total organic acids were 283.6mg/L at the first 2 h of hydrolytic reaction and 305.5mg/L at the beginning of recirculation between the two reactors and then decreased to around 200mg/L and keep stable. The results of synchronous and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the protein-like fluorescence peaks were identified in the hydrolytic acidification reactor and their intensities increased gradually along with hydrolytic time increasing. Moreover, the fulvic acid-like fluorescence peaks in biological contact oxidation reactor were observed, and the intensity increased gradually. The synchronous intensity of 277nm wavelength was significantly correlated with the total organic acids concentration. Variation of SUVA(254) and E-253/E-203 during the hydrolytic acidification process indicated that concentrations of aromatic and unsaturated compounds slightly increase and those aromatic compounds are not stable. However, SUVA(254) and E-253/E-203 decreased rapidly in the biological contact oxidation reactor, which suggested that easily degradable organic matters had been consumed rapidly.

Dissolved organic matter in relation to nutrients (N and P) and heavy metals in surface runoff water as affected by temporal variation and land uses - A case study from Indian River Area, south Florida, USA	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Transport of dissolved organic matter in runoff water plays a critical role in the increased inputs of nutrients (N and P) and metals (Fe, Cu and Zn) in water, and the deposition of muck sediments in the Saint Lucie Estuary and Indian River Lagoon, Florida. The objectives of this study were to investigate the variation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN) in surface runoff water with varying land uses, and to explore their possible relations with the leaching losses of nutrients N and P, and metals Fe, Cu, and Zn from different land uses. For this, surface runoff water from two major agricultural production systems (citrus grove and vegetable farm) in south Florida was collected weekly using pre-installed autosamplers during Jan. 2008-Mar. 2010. Meanwhile, runoff water from twelve field sites with varying land uses (such as ranch, golf course, and forest) was collected monthly using a grab sampler from Aug. 2008 to April, 2010, and soils were collected at the depth of 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm twice a year from autosampler-installed locations and on Nov. 25th, 2008 from grab sampling locations as well. In the field, water samples were measured for electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature; in the laboratory, water samples were analyzed for pH, total solids, turbidity, DOC, DN, total P (TP), and metals Cu, Fe and Zn with or without passing a 0.45 mu m filter membrane. After passing a 2 mm sieve, fresh soil samples were analyzed for moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, 0.5 M K2SO4 solution extractable DOC/DN, and Mehlich 3 extractable P, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of DOG and DN in runoff water were observed, with the greatest average concentrations of DOC and DN from ranch (similar to 28 and similar to 2.3 mg L-1) and the lowest from golf course (similar to 16 mg L-1) for DOC and from forest and nursery for DN (similar to 1.5-1.6 mg L-1), respectively. Temporal fluctuations of DOC and DN in runoff water from varying land uses were in good accord with rainfall intensity and frequency of rainfall. Temporal variations of TP and metals Fe, Cu, and Zn were influenced by climatic condition as well. Citrus grove exported greater amounts of DOC and DN in runoff water (27.6 and 3.51 mg L-1 of median value) than vegetable farms (13.8 and 2.26 mg L-1 of median value). Annual cumulative loads of DOC and total N in 2008, 2009 or 2010 were >20 kg ha(-1), greater than those of TP (<13.5 kg ha(-1)) and metals Fe, Cu, and Zn (<1.5 kg ha(-1)). Ranch soil had the highest extractable DOC concentration (>100 mg kg(-1)), accounting for 1% of its total organic carbon. Soil extractable DN had significant correlations with extractable P and Cu/Zn in soils. In conclusion, soil total organic carbon pool and its availability had an important effect on DOG and DN in runoff water. Land use type and rainfall event were the two influential factors affecting concentrations of DOC and DN, and the export of nutrients N and P. and metals in runoff water. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the nature of this relationship, the distributions and mixing behaviors of DOC and CDOM are reviewed in the world's major estuaries and bays. It is found that, generally, the CDOM concentration is well correlated with the salinity in most estuaries, while DOC usually shows a nonconservative behavior which leads to a weak correlation between the DOC concentration and the CDOM concentration. To establish a good satellite reversion of the DOC concentration, the East China Sea(ECS) was taken as an example, and the mixing behavior of DOC and CDOM as well as the influence of biogeochemical processes were analyzed except for the physical mixing process with the data from late autumn (November, 2010) and winter (December, 2009) cruises. In the two ECS cruises, the CDOM concentration was found to be tightly correlated with the salinity, influenced little by the photochemical or biological processes. The data from the winter cruise show that DOC followed a conservative mixing along the salinity gradient, while in the late autumn cruise it was significantly affected by the biological activities, resulting in a poor correlation between the DOC and the CDOM. Accordingly, an improvedDOC algorithm(CSDM) was proposed: when the biological influence was significant (Chl a greater than 0.8 A mu g/dm(3)), DOC was retrieved by the conservative and biologicalmodel, and if the conservativemixing was dominant (Chl a less than 0.8 A mu g/dm(3)), the direct DOC concentration and CDOM concentration relationship was used. Based on the proposed algorithm, a reasonable DOC distribution for the ECS from satellite was obtained in this study, and the proposedmethod can be applied to the other large river-dominantmarginal sea.

Exploring the limits of dissolved organic matter fluorescence for determining seawater sources and ballast water exchange on the US Pacific coast	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												To minimize the risk of biological invasions associated with commercial shipping, vessels are required to conduct ballast water exchange (BWE)>= 200 nautical miles offshore when arriving in the US from foreign ports, and some states require coastal BWE >= 50 miles offshore along domestic routes. Previous research suggests that the intensity of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) can be used to verify whether BWE was implemented. This study examined seasonal and spatial variability of fDOM in Pacific rim ports and the adjacent seas, using the North American coast as a model system to test whether regional fluorescence intensity thresholds consistently distinguish port sites from coastal and oceanic sites at increasing distances from shore. Over 2000 samples from major port systems on the US Pacific coast and along offshore (perpendicular) and alongshore (parallel) transects were analyzed. Overall, humic fDOM fluorescence intensity (C3* = 370/494 nm) effectively discriminated port versus oceanic sites located further than 100 miles from shore, but discriminated only a subset of coastal versus oceanic sources within the northeastern Pacific. Data from additional global ports are needed to predict the frequency of false positive or false negative ballast source determinations using fDOM for foreign vessel traffic. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

PARAFAC decomposed the fluorescence matrices of CDOM into three humic-like (C1 : 250, 345/454 nm; C2: 230, 310/374 nm; C5: 265, 424/478 nm) and two protein-like (C3: 230/342 nm; C4: 230, 275/322 nm) components. Good linear correlation occurred among three humic-like components and between two protein-like components, respectively. This demonstrated that the same types of components (humic-like or protein-like) have similar origin and geochemical behaviors. High abundances of humic-like components were found at the upstream zone of the Jiulong Estuary, while the high abundance of protein-like components occurred at the northern part of semi-enclosed Western Xiamen Harbor. The significant negative correlations were found between the abundances of all fluorescence components and salinity in the estuary area. However, the high contents of chlorophyll a were in line with the high abundances of C3 and 04 in non-estuarine area, which implies that phytoplankton activity could be another important source of protein-like components besides the river runoff. A principal component analysis (PCA) of fluorescent components revealed that terrestrial runoff was the dominant sources of CDOM fluorescence components in Xiamen Bay, while the contribution of the in situ biological processes was relatively lower. This study demonstrates that the combination use of PARAFAC modeling and chemometrics (i.e. PCA) is very useful in identifying the origin of CDOM and quantifying the primary factors influencing their distributions.

Seasonal and temporal characterization of dissolved organic matter in rainwater by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic carbon in rainwater was concentrated by two separate techniques and characterized by H-1-NMR. The total H-1-NMR integral of lyophilized rainwater was higher in every rain sample than that of C18 solid phase extracted samples and always contained a higher percentage integral in the region of protons bound to carbon atoms singly bound to oxygen (H-C-O), such as alcohols, polyols and carbohydrate-like compounds. C18 extracted samples had higher % integral in the alkyl region, consistent with reverse phase extraction of more hydrophobic components in rainwater. Differences in both the H-1-NMR integration and spectral pattern of lyophilized rainwater samples were especially apparent between spring and winter rains, with spring samples having higher percent carbohydrate (H-C-O) signal and winter rains having higher percent alkyl protons and a spectral pattern consistent with the presence of saturated fatty acids. Spring rains are characterized by lower % Alkyl signal coupled with higher % H-C-O than all other events while marine winter events appear in regions characterized by relatively high % Alkyl and average % H-C-O, consistent with increased abundance of fatty acids or fatty acid oxidation products. The H-1-NMR data presented in this manuscript are important because they provide spectral data relating to the source and chemical characteristics of dissolved organic carbon in rainwater as a function of season and air mass back trajectory.

Chronic nitrogen (N) deposition may alter the bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in streams by multiple pathways. Elevated N deposition may alter the nutrient stoichiometry of DOM as well as nutrient availability in stream water. 2. We evaluated the influence of a decadal-scale experimental N enrichment on the relative importance of DOM nutrient content and inorganic nutrient availability on the bioavailability of DOM. We measured the consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and changes in nutrient concentration, DOM components and enzyme activity in a bottle incubation assay with different DOM and nutrient treatments. To evaluate the effect of DOM stoichiometry, we used leaf leachates of different carbon/N/phosphorus (C : N :P) ratio, made from leaf litter sourced in the reference and N-enriched catchments at the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM). We also manipulated the concentration of inorganic N and P to compare the effect of nutrient enrichment with DOM stoichiometry. 3. DOC from the N-enriched catchment was consumed 14% faster than that from the reference catchment. However, mean DOC consumption for both leachates was more than doubled by the simultaneous addition of N and P, compared to controls, while the addition of N or P alone increased consumption by 42 and 23%, respectively. The effect of N and/or P enrichment consistently had a greater effect than DOM source for all response variables considered. 4. We subsequently conducted DOC uptake measurements using leaf leachate addition under ambient and elevated N and P in the streams draining the reference and N-enriched catchments at BBWM. In both streams, DOC uptake lengths were shorter when N and P were elevated. 5. Although both DOM stoichiometry and inorganic nutrient availability affect DOM bioavailability, N and P co-limitation appears to be the dominant driver of reach-scale processing of DOM.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2013	58	2					248	260		10.1111/fwb.12054						WOS:000313128300003

Leaf litter age, chemical quality, and photodegradation control the fate of leachate dissolved organic matter in a dryland river	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We used biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254), indicator of aromatic carbon content) and laboratory experiments to determine the bioavailability and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from fresh leaves and litter aged on a seasonally dry floodplain for 2, 4, and 6 months. Our objective was to elucidate how litter age and solar radiation affect the bacterial utilization of DOM released from floodplain leaf litter when inundated. Leachate percent BDOC ranged from 22 to 47% for three different leaf species and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing litter age. However, total BDOC (mg C L-1) was unrelated to litter age. Bacterial utilization of DOM leachate collected from litter aged on the floodplain for four and six months significantly increased following 48 h of irradiation for all species but there was no difference for leachate from fresh and two month old litter. The photo-mediated increase in percent BDOC was concomitant with a decrease in aromatic carbon content, as SUVA(254) values decreased on average 9 +/- 6% for light exposure experiments. Our findings demonstrate that sunlight moderates the degradation of plant litter in the terrestrial environment through the photo-mediated shift in DOM composition and its bioavailability in streams.

J	Miller, SA; Shank, GC				Miller, Stephanie A.; Shank, G. Christopher			Influence of severe drought conditions on chromophoric dissolved organic matter dynamics in south Texas coastal waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												We investigated chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dynamics in response to the severe drought conditions of 2009 in the Aransas-Copano (AC) Bay complex and adjacent nearshore Gulf of Mexico (GoM) along the southern Texas (USA) coast. Surface water absorption coefficients (a(305) in m(-1)) were measured daily at the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute (UTMSI) pier located at the interface between the AC complex and the GoM. From June to August 2009, a(305) averaged 0.81 +/- 0.31 m(-1) compared to 1.20 +/- 0.70 m(-1) during summer of 2008 (June-August) and 1.84 +/- 034 m(-1) during summer 2007 (non-drought year). Despite negligible freshwater input to the AC system for most of 2009, mean a(305) values for AC Bay sites were similar in 2008 and 2009, ranging from 3.24 +/- 0.60 m(-1) in the lower estuary to 6.22 +/- 0.55 m(-1) in the upper estuary during summer 2009, and 3.15 +/- 0.38 m(-1) to 6.81 +/- 0.73 m(-1) during summer 2008 (no data for 2007). CDOM photobleaching experiments were performed using a SunTest XLS + solar simulator with an irradiation spectrum that closely matches solar UV at subtropical latitudes. AC Bay samples exhibited a(305) photobleaching half-lives of 33-48 h, while GoM samples exhibited a(305) photobleaching half-lives of 36-89 h. We estimate that summertime photobleaching may reduce CDOM levels by >50% in the AC bay complex before discharge into the GoM and by up to 25% more throughout the nearshore waters along the western GoM shelf.
