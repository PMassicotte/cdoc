Accurate quantification of freely dissolved organochlorine pesticides in water in the presence of dissolved organic matter using triolein-embedded cellulose acetate membrane	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A novel method is described using triolein-embedded cellulose acetate membrane (TECAM) for accurate determination of the freely dissolved fraction of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in waters rich in dissolved organic matter (DOM). The performance of the method was tested with an air-bridge system for extracting OCPs from aqueous solutions with and without humic acid. In addition, the partition coefficients between humic acid and water (K (doc)s) for 20 OCPs were determined by TECAM with negligible depletion extraction. Results show that TECAM predominantly extracts the freely dissolved compounds and its extraction efficiency decreases significantly with an increase in concentration of humic acid in water. The proposed methodology is suitable for facile laboratory K (doc) measurement for moderate to high hydrophobic compounds (log K (ow) > 4). The linear relationship between log K-ow and log K-doc obtained in this study agrees well with the results reported earlier. The kinetic uptake rate constants (k (u)s) and TECAM-water partition coefficients (K(TECAM)s) for the 20 OCPs were obtained using the controlled laboratory continuous-flow and static exposure system, respectively. These calibration parameters were used in the field experiment to estimate the freely dissolved concentrations of OCPs in the water of Taihu Lake in China. Our results show that TECAM can be used successfully to determine the freely dissolved OCPs in aquatic environments containing DOM, and the method is particularly suited for long-term water sampling.

A one-step resin-exchange method was developed to measure the Cu-Mobilizing-Potential (CuMP) of DOM at pCu 11.3 and pH 7.0, representing background values. The CuMP of DOM was measured in soil solutions of 13 uncontaminated soils with different DOM extraction methods. The CuMP, expressed per unit dissolved organic carbon (DOC), varied 10-fold and followed the order water extracts > 0.01 M CaCl2 extracts > pore water. Soil solutions, obtained from soils that were stored air-dry for a long time or were subjected to drying-wetting cycles, had elevated DOC concentration, but the DOM had a low CuMP. Prolonged soil incubations decreased the DOC concentration and increased the CuMP, suggesting that most of the initially elevated DOM is less humified and has lower Cu affinity than DOM remaining after incubation. A significant positive correlation between the specific UV-absorption of DOM (indicating aromaticity) and CuMP was found for all DOM samples (R-2 = 0.58). It is concluded that the DOC concentration in soil is an insufficient predictor for the Cu mobilization and that DOM samples isolated from air-dried soils are distinct from those of soils kept moist.

J	Miller, CL; Mason, RP; Gilmour, CC; Heyes, A				Miller, Carrie L.; Mason, Robert P.; Gilmour, Cynthia C.; Heyes, Andrew			Influence of dissolved organic matter on the complexation of mercury under sulfidic conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The complexation of Hg under sulfidic conditions influences its bioavailability for microbial methylation. Neutral dissolved Hg-sulfide complexes are readily available to Hg-methylating bacteria in culture, and thermodynamic models predict that inorganic Hg-sulfide complexes dominate dissolved Hg speciation under natural sulfidic conditions. However, these models have not been validated in the field. To examine the complexation of Hg in natural sulfidic waters, octanol/water partitioning methods were modified for use under environmentally relevant conditions, and a centrifuge ultrafiltration technique was developed. These techniques demonstrated much lower concentrations of dissolved Hg-sulfide complexes than predicted. Furthermore, the study revealed an interaction between Hg, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and sulfide that is not captured by current thermodynamic models. Whereas Hg forms strong complexes with DOM under oxic conditions, these complexes had not been expected to form in the presence of sulfide because of the stronger affinity of Hg for sulfide relative to its affinity for DOM. The observed interaction between Hg and DOM in the presence of sulfide likely involves the formation of a DOM-Hg-sulfide complex or results from the hydrophobic partitioning of neutral Hg-sulfide complexes into the higher-molecular-weight DOM. An understanding of the mechanism of this interaction and determination of complexation coefficients for the Hg-sulfide-DOM complex are needed to adequately assess how our new finding affects Hg bioavailability, sorption, and flux.

From the fluorescence properties, protein-like substances were usually found in the 0.1 mu m-GF/F fraction (the Durapore membrane retentate of the GF/F filtrate) of the lake DOM. The results indicated autochthonous production of protein-like organic matters in the take environment. Fulvic acid (FA)-like components were composed of two fractions with respect to fluorescence properties and molecular size. Two FA-like fluorescence peaks, which showed different fluorescence peak positions in the excitation-emission matrix (EEM), were partly fractionated by the molecular size of 5000 daltons (5 kDa). The FA-like fluorescence peak position of the <5-kDa fraction was observed at the shorter wavelength region compared with that of the fraction between 5 kDa and 0.1 mu m (5 kDa-0.1 mu m fraction). A blue shift of the FA-like fluorescence peak position as well as a decrease in the molecular size of the DOM was observed in lake samples. The relative contribution of the <5kDa fraction to the DOC concentration was high in lake waters (68%-79%) compared with river waters (44%-68%), suggesting characteristic changes in molecular size between riverine and lacustrine DOM. DOM of the 5 kDa-0.1 pm fraction was relatively higher in river waters than in lake waters. These findings coincided with in situ distributions of the fluorescence properties and molecular size of DOM found in both stream and lake environments. These results indicate that FA-like substances from forested watersheds are decomposed qualitatively and quantitatively in the river-lake environment by photochemical and biological processes.

In the present study, inoculating microbes (ZJ, MS) were used in municipal solid wastes composting, and the composting process was assisted using industrial technology. During composting, DOM was extracted from compost and purified. The spectroscopic characteristics of the DOM were determined using UV, FTIR, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The result showed that at the final stage of composting, the UV, FTIR and fluorescence spectra were similar in shape among all treatments, but the characteristic peaks intensities were different compared with the control process (CK) with no inoculation microbes, and the DOM spectral characteristics of inoculation with microbes showed that the shoulder peak of UV spectra near 280 nm obviously weakened; The FTIR spectrum exhibited a reduction in polysaccharides, and a relative increase in aromatic components; the fluorescence spectra exhibited an increase in aromatic compounds, and the fluorescence spectra of DOM were similar to that of fulvic acid in sewage sludge. Indeed, the UV, FTIR and fluorescence spectra all led to the same conclusion, i.e. treatments by inoculation with microbes led to a greater degree of aromatization of DOM than in CK, in the following order: MS+ZJ>ZJ>MS>CK. At final stage of MSW composting, the DOM spectra of the mixed inoculation of MSW with MS and ZJ was more similar to fulvic acid in sludge. It was indicated that DOM from composting with inoculation MS and ZJ has more activity than that of other treatments.																	1000-0593					APR	2007	27	4					735	738								WOS:000246217100027

J	Hunt, JF; Ohno, T				Hunt, James F.; Ohno, Tsutomu			Characterization of fresh and decomposed dissolved organic matter using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and multiway analysis	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Fresh and decomposed dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from 13 plant biomass and animal manure sources was characterized using multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The PARAFAC analysis modeled seven fluorescence components: tryptophan-like, tyrosine-like, and five humic substance-like components. For most of the plant-derived DOM solutions, decomposition significantly affected the concentration of three humic substance-like-associated components, increasing two and decreasing one. The effect of decomposition upon DOM derived from animal manures was dependent on the manure source. For a majority of the DOM extracts, the ratio of fluorescence intensity to absorptivity at 254 nm increased following decomposition, indicating that fluorescing DOM compounds were generally more resistant to biodegradation than nonfluorescing UV-absorbing compounds. Molar absorptivity, humification index (HIX), and apparent molecular weight (MWAP) increased by 38.0, 38.8, and 370%, respectively, following decomposition. Spearman correlation analysis showed a strong positive relationship between the humic substance-like components and the DOM MWAP, absorptivity, and HIX. The results of this study support the use of multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with PARAFAC as a method to monitor the decomposition of carbon-rich soil amendments such as crop residues, green manures, and animal manures.																	0021-8561					MAR 21	2007	55	6					2121	2128		10.1021/jf063336m						WOS:000244867300011	17305362

Chemical characterisation and composition	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The Dar beta-Zingst Bodden Chain (DZBC) is a shallow tideless estuary of 4 separate basins containing extremely high contents of particulate organic matter (POM) because of an eutrophication for more than 30 years. Therefore the open question to be addressed in this study was whether and how high POM is reflected in amounts and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The pelagial was sampled at different stations along the eutrophication gradient during the growing season 1996, as well as in winter 1995/96 and 1996/97 to assess seasonal variations. The chemically utilisable compounds (uDOM) like dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) and dissolved free carbohydrates (DFCHO), as well as the corresponding polymer fractions dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA) and dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) were analysed together with the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The concentrations of these fractions were used to calculate the respective percentage contribution of the DOC and DON and to compare with the C:N ratio in the dissolved pool. In the DZBC very high absolute amounts of DOM components of up to 30 mu mol C 1(-1) for DFAA, 288 mu mol C 1(-1) for DCAA, 67 mu mol C 1(-1) for DFCHO, 196 mu mol C 1(-1) for DCCHO were determined. On average, proportions of 0.8% DFAA, 3.6% DFCHO, 6.5% DCAA and 12.6% DCCHO of DOC were measured in the growing season of 1996. Consequently, at least 23.5% of DOC in the DZBC were classified as readily utilisable. The concentrations of these bio-available compounds fluctuated strongly over the course of the year, but the dissolved monomers more than the corresponding polymers. With the exception of DFAA at significantly higher concentrations in winter, a clear seasonality in DOM compounds was absent. In spite of the high amounts of uDOM, most likely being able to sustain many microheterotrophs, the quality of the total DOM has to be assessed as recalcitrant due to an average molar CN ratio of ca. 19. This fact makes the Dar beta-Zingst Bodden Chain quite unique concerning persistent high amounts of utilisable and refractory organic matter. So far, it was not possible to prove whether the high DOM originates directly from primary production, is mostly the result of microbial degradation in the pelagial or stems from anaerobic degradation in the sediment. However, the high DOM concentrations, its element composition and the accumulation of glycine and serine in the dissolved amino acid pool suggest that the degradation of DOM was advanced. Such analyses seem to be an additional tool to describe the ecological state of highly polluted waters and estimate the origin and fate of organic matter. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study the photochemical production of ammonium from Baltic Sea DOM was assessed in the laboratory. Filtered samples from the Bothnian Bay, the Gulf of Finland and the Arkona Sea were exposed to UVA light at environmentally relevant levels, and the developments in ammonium concentrations, light absorption, fluorescence and molecular size distribution were followed. The exposures resulted in a decrease in DOM absorption and loss of the larger sized fraction of DOM. Analysis of the fluorescence properties of DOM using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified 6 independent components. Five components decreased in intensity as a result of the UVA exposures. One component was produced as a result of the exposures and represents labile photoproducts derived from terrestrial DOM. The characteristics of DOM in samples from the Bothnian Bay and Gulf of Finland were similar and dominated by terrestrially derived material. The DOM from the Arkona Sea was more autochthonous in character. Photoammonification differed depending on the composition of DOM. Calculated photoammonification rates in surface waters varied between 121 and 382 mu mol NH4+ L-1 d(-1). Estimated areal daily production rates ranged between 37 and 237 mu mol NH4+ m(-2) d(-1), which are comparable to atmospheric deposition rates and suggest that photochemical remineralisation of organic nitrogen may be a significant source of bioavailable nitrogen to surface waters during summer months with high irradiance and low inorganic nitrogen concentrations.

Bacterial responses in activity and community composition to photo-oxidation of dissolved organic matter from soil and surface waters	AQUATIC SCIENCES												To better understand how photo-oxidation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects microbial activity and DOM processing along hydrological flow paths in an arctic catchment, we conducted experiments measuring responses in bacterial production (BP) to sunlight-exposed DOM from up-slope sources, including soil, stream, and lake water. Overall, sunlight exposure significantly reduced specific ultra-violet absorbance and dissolved organic carbon concentrations and increased phenolic concentrations; these changes were more pronounced in soil than in surface waters. Sunlight-exposed DOM reduced BP in common inoculum bioassay experiments at short time scales (hours), but the magnitude of the effect differed among DOM sources and was related to phenolic content; effects were more negative on DOM sources with high phenolic contents. In contrast, longer contact times (weeks) between bacteria and photo-oxidized soil, stream, and lake water DOM enhanced, did not change, and reduced BP, respectively. In these longer-term experiments, sunlight-exposed DOM had a greater positive effect on lake than stream BP, and caused shifts in bacterial community composition (based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of bacterial-specific 16S rDNA). Changes in bacterial community composition were greater in response to sunlight-exposed DOM from soils than from the stream. Our findings suggest that overall impacts of DOM photo-oxidation in aquatic environments depends on DOM source, and that contrasting effects of photo-oxidized DOM at varying time scales may be partly due to shifts in the bacterial community composition to groups better able to consume photoproducts or tolerate harmful radicals.

Toxicity of copper to larval Pimephales promelas in the presence of photodegraded natural dissolved organic matter	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Copper (Cu) complexation with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) mitigates Cu bioavailability to aquatic biota by decreasing the activity of the cupric ion ({Cu2+}). However, DOM is photochemically unstable. In a previous study, we demonstrated that irradiation (similar to 13 days sunlight) of DOM collected from a river decreased its binding-site density for Cu by 45%, but increased binding-site density in wetland DOM by 147%. Binding-site densities correlated positively with ketones and aldehydes (C-II groups). Herein, we determined the mortality of larval fathead minnows (FHM; Pimephales promelas) as a function of {Cu2+} in 96 h static-renewal toxicity tests without DOM. Next, we calculated {Cu2+} in control and photooxidized DOM and then predicted mortality of larval FHM in toxicity tests. Observed mortalities agreed with predictions (r(2) = 0.96) in treatments with lowest binding-site densities and proportions of C-II groups (highest {Cu2+}). However, treatments with -50% lower {Cu2+}, containing higher proportions of C-II groups, had equally high mortalities and poorer fits with predictions (r(2) approximate to 0.75), possibly indicating that Cu bound to C-II groups are bioavailable. To our knowledge, this study is the first to predict and then directly test the effects of DOM photooxidation on Cu toxicity.

M.; Struijs, Jaap			Distribution of PAHs and PCBs to dissolved organic matter: High distribution coefficients with consequences for environmental fate modeling	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic carbon/water distribution coefficients (K-DOC) were measured for a selection of PCBs with octanol/water partition coefficients (K-OW) ranging from 10(5.6) to 10(7.5). A solid phase dosing and sampling technique was applied to determine K-DOC to Aldrich humic acid. This technique is in particular suitable for determining the distribution of very hydrophobic chemicals to complex matrices like humic acids. The K-DOC values were calculated from the experimental data using a linear model. Determined K-DOC's were evaluated in relation to octanol/water partition coefficients of the test compounds, and compared to literature data. Measured K-DOC values were somewhat higher than literature data, which can probably be attributed to the overestimation of freely dissolved aqueous concentration as a result of incomplete phase separation in other studies, and to the unique character of Aldrich humic acid as a "sorbent" or co-solute or to the fact that Aldrich humic acid is not a typical DOC, and other (adsorption) processes can occur. This study reports DOC distribution coefficients that belong to the highest ones ever measured. In addition, the DOC distribution was discussed in relation to current risk assessment modeling.

Production of hydrated electrons from photoionization of dissolved organic matter in natural waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Under UV irradiation, an important primary photochemical reaction of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is electron ejection to produce hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)). The efficiency of this process has been studied in both fresh water and seawater samples with both steady-state scavenger (S-SS) and time-resolved laser flash photolysis (LFP) methods. However, the apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of e(aq)(-) for the same samples using the two methods differ by as much as a factor of 100, necessitating a closer re-examination of how the process is measured. We developed a highly sensitive multipass LFP apparatus that allows detection of transient species at very low and variable UV irradiation intensities. Under single-photon conditions, we measured the AQY of e(aq)(-) from Laurentian fulvic acid as 1.3 x 10(-4), and set the upper limit for other CDOM samples at 6 x 10(-5), bringing the LFP results into agreement with those from S-SS methods. We also examined the ionization at elevated irradiation intensities and clearly demonstrated that multiphoton ionization occurs at intensities well below those usually used in LFP experiments, but well above those likely to occur at the earth's surface. This multiphoton ionization is probably the cause of the high AQYs reported by earlier LFP work. In addition, we also observed in real time other photochemical reactions, such as triplet quenching and bleaching, in the single photon regime.

Comparison of the optical properties of dissolved organic matter in two river-influenced coastal regions of the Canadian Arctic	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The optical characteristics, of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were analyzed in the Great Whale River and adjacent Hudson Bay (55 degrees N, 77 degrees W) in the eastern Canadian Low Arctic, and in the Mackenzie River and adjacent Beaufort Sea in the western Canadian High Arctic (70 degrees N, 133 degrees W). Sampling was during ice-free open water conditions. Both rivers contained high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (3 and 6 mg DOC l(-1) in the Great Whale River and Mackenzie River, respectively) and CDOM (a(320) of 11 and 14 m(-1)), resulting in a substantial load of organic matter to their coastal seas. There were pronounced differences in the CDOM characteristics of the two rivers, notably in their synchronous fluorescence scans (SFS). The latter showed that the Mackenzie River was depleted in humic materials, implying a more mature catchment relative to the younger, more recently glaciated Great Whale River system. SFS spectra had a similar shape across the freshwater-saltwater transition zone of the Great Whale plume, and DOC was linearly related to salinity implying conservative mixing and no loss by flocculation or biological processes across the salt front. In contrast, there were major differences in SFS spectral shape from the Mackenzie River to the freshwater-influenced coastal ocean, with a marked decrease in the relative importance of fulvic and humic acid materials. The SFS spectra for the coastal Beaufort Sea in September-October strongly resembled those recorded for the Mackenzie River during the high discharge, CDOM-rich, snowmelt period in June, but with some loss of autochthonous materials. These results are consistent with differences in freshwater residence time between the Mackenzie River and Great Whale River coastal ocean systems. Models of arctic continental shelf responses to present and future climate regimes will need to consider these striking regional differences in the organic matter content, biogeochemistry and optics between waters from different catchments and different inshore hydrodynamic regimes.

Strong coupling between natural Planctomycetes and changes in the quality of dissolved organic matter in freshwater samples	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Dilution-regrowth experiments coupled to fluorescence in situ hybridization were conducted with samples from two humic reservoirs in order to examine how inorganic nutrients (N, P) affect free-living bacterioplankton phylogenetic groups and subsequently the quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The experiments were complemented by analyses of the empirical relationships between the targeted bacteria, nutrients, DOM and grazers. The ratio of absorbance of waters (A) at 250 and 365 nm (A(250 nm):A(365 nm)), which has been found to increase with the proportion of small molecules in the DOM pool in other humic waters, was used as an index of DOM quality. When nutrient stimulated bacteria, both the responses of bacterial groups (in the absence of grazers) and the ratio A(250 nm):A(365 nm) were generally different between treatments (+N, +P, +NP), suggesting that in nutrient-poor systems, differences in the type of inorganic nutrient supply will ultimately cause differences in DOM quality. The ratio A(250 nm),:A(365 nm) peaked in the +N treatments where members of the Planctomycetes (PLA) were the most stimulated group, and across treatments, PLA best explained (positive relationship) variations in this ratio. Consistent with this, the in situ data showed that the removal of the negative effects of flagellates on PLA yielded the highest R-2 in attempts to use bacterial groups to explain variations in A(250 nm):A(365 nm). These findings provide lines of evidence, not previously demonstrated in natural waters, that Planctomycetes may be an important factor changing the DOM quality, particularly in nutrient-poor systems when supplied with inorganic N.																	0168-6496					MAR	2007	59	3					543	555		10.1111/j.174-6941.2006.00222.x						WOS:000244719400001	17059481

Photooxidation of wetland and riverine dissolved organic matter: altered copper complexation and organic composition	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In natural waters, the uptake of transition metals such as copper (Cu) by aquatic biota depends on the activity of the free cupric ion ({Cu2+}) rather than on total Cu concentration. Thus, an important ecological function of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems is Cu-DOM complexation, which greatly decreases the {Cu2+}. However, Cu bioavailability is greatly modified by source and environmental history of DOM because DOM affinity for Cu varies by orders of magnitude among DOM sources; moreover, DOM is photochemically unstable. During 72-h irradiation experiments at intensities approximating sunlight with DOM from a palustrine wetland and a third-order river, we investigated photooxidative effects on DOM complexation of Cu as well as spectral and chemical changes in DOM that might explain altered Cu complexation. Irradiation decreased Cu complexation by riverine DOM, but unexpectedly increased Cu complexation by wetland DOM, resulting in 150% greater {Cu2+} in riverine DOM at the same dissolved organic carbon concentrations. The specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVa) and humic substances tracked photochemical changes in the conditional stability constants of Cu-DOM complexes, suggesting that the aromaticity of DOM influences its affinity for Cu. Carbonyl concentration in C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (C-13-NMR) covaried directly with Cu binding-site densities in DOM. However, no aspect of Cu-DOM complexation consistently covaried with fluorophores (i.e., the fluorescence index) or low molecular weight organic acids. Our results suggest that global increases in UV radiation will affect Cu-DOM complexation and subsequent Cu toxicity depending on light regime as well as DOM source.

Le B.; Markager, Stiig; Cauwet, Gustave; Borch, Niels Henrik; Evans, Dylan; Riemann, Bo			Partitioning of organic production in marine plankton communities: The effects of inorganic nutrient ratios and community composition on new dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the partitioning of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus between particulate and dissolved production using 11-m(3) marine mesocosms (bags) in a Norwegian fjord with a salinity of 28.3, a chlorophyll concentration of 0.6 mu g L-1, an even biomass among five algal groups, and nitrogen limitation as the initial conditions. The experiment lasted 21 days in August. Addition of silicate (+Si) resulted in diatom dominance, while a more diverse community was present in treatments with no added Si (-Si). Addition of inorganic nutrients in a N:P gradient from 64 to 4 either conserved the initial N limitation or forced the plankton communities to P limitation. Per added limiting nutrient, the diatom-dominated bags produced more particulate (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than the other bags. However, the relative partitioning of net production to POC and DOC did not differ as a function of the plankton communities. Between 22% and 33% of the net production accumulated as new DOC. The higher values were found in the N-limited bags. The production of new dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was variable over time, and short periods of positive production were followed by removal (negative production). Between 6% and 22% of the assimilated N was recovered as new DON in the N-replete bags, while the DON production was very low during N limitation. The community structure had no effects on nitrogen partitioning. Diatom dominance (+Si bags) resulted in P sequestration to particles and a constant low net production of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) across the nutrient gradient. The production of DOP was low in the P-limited (-Si) bags; however, with a surplus of inorganic P, most of the assimilated P (74% to 85%) was recovered as new DOP. The consequence was a huge range in stoichiometric ratios for newly produced dissolved organic matter (DOM). With N limitation, the C: N ratio of new DOM was from 40 to 100, but it was below 40 under N-replete conditions. The C: P ratio of new DOM in the -Si bags traced the P availability, and values approached 500 in P-deficient bags to values between 17 and 58 in the P-replete bags. The C: P ratio of new DOM in the +Si bags was about 300 at all dosing regimes. Consequently, the range in N: P ratios was also large, with values from below 1 to about 30. Carbon-rich DOM in oceans and coastal waters is not necessarily a function of a slow diagenetic "maturation" process but can be produced almost immediately. Both the nutrient regime and phytoplankton community composition affected the production and composition of new DOM in this experiment.

Photochemical control of copper complexation by dissolved organic matter in Rocky Mountain streams, Colorado	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated photochemical, seasonal, and source effects on copper (Cu) complexation by dissolved organic matter (DOM). Cu-DOM complexation regulates Cu toxicity by decreasing the activity of the cupric ion ({Cu2+}), the most bioavailable Cu species. However, DOM is photochemically unstable under solar insolation. We analyzed Cu-DOM complexation before and after photooxidation of DOM collected from six rivers during spring runoff and late summer (n = 12 DOM samples). After irradiation of DOM for 24 h in a solar simulator (similar to 4 d of ambient insolation), we analyzed Cu-DOM complexation during potentiometric titrations of Cu into dissolved organic carbon concentrations of 5 mg L-1. In 10 DOM samples across the range of titrations (Cu, 7.8 x 10(-8) to 8.7 x 10(-6) mol L-1), photooxidation of DOM decreased Cu complexation, increasing {Cu2+} by an average of 156% +/- 28% ((x) over bar +/- SE). In one DOM sample, irradiation had no net effect on {Cu2+} (6% +/- 12%), whereas in another Cu complexation was enhanced (30% +/- 4%). Cu complexation that was indistinguishable before irradiation decreased significantly more during photooxidation of DOM in spring (185% +/- 25%) than in summer (74% +/- 14%). The specific ultraviolet absorption coefficient at 254 mu explained similar to 60% of the variation in conditional stability constants of Cu-DOM complexes regardless of DOM source, season, or extent of photooxidation. During a simulated contaminant event where 1.5 x 10-6 mol L-1 Cu was added to site waters, water chemistry reduced bioavailability in 6 of 12 cases to below the {Cu2+} expected to cause 50% mortality ({Cu2+}(ILC50)) in larval fish. However, after 6 d of photooxidation, none of the site waters remained below {CU2+}(LC50).

J	Wetz, MS; Wheeler, PA				Wetz, Michael S.; Wheeler, Patricia A.			Release of dissolved organic matter by coastal diatoms	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) production was examined in axenic batch cultures of five coastal diatom species. For Chaetoceros decipiens, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) accumulated beginning in late exponential growth as a result of increased cell density. For Cylindrotheca closterium, DOC actually decreased in late exponential growth and reached zero by the end of the experiment. This coincided with continued particulate organic carbon (POC) production and a threefold increase in the per-cell concentration of transparent exopolymer particles after nutrients were depleted. DOC release rates varied between species but were significantly higher for all five species in exponential or transition growth than during stationary growth. On average, 5% of the total fixed C was released as DOC for four of the diatoms, whereas C. decipiens released similar to 21% of its fixed C as DOC. The percentage of fixed C released as DOC varied little with nutrient availability or diatom growth stage. The DOM produced by some diatom species adheres to filters and is measured in the particulate organic matter (POM) fraction when cells are separated from the medium by filtration. This may be an important problem when diatom species with known benthic life histories are prevalent. In contrast, for species like Chaetoceros that have no benthic life history, DOM release rates estimated by bulk measurements or (14)C appear to be accurate. Overall, these results indicate that the species composition of phytoplankton blooms has the potential to influence the relative importance of POM and DOM production and can complicate interpretation of those measurements.																	0024-3590					MAR	2007	52	2					798	807								WOS:000245145200028

Availability of dissolved organic matter offsets metabolic costs of a protracted larval period for Bugula neritina (Bryozoa)	MARINE BIOLOGY												For nearly a century researchers have investigated the uptake and utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by marine invertebrates, but its contribution to their growth, reproduction, and survival remains unclear. Here, the benefit of DOM uptake was assessed for the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina (Linnaeus 1758) through performance comparisons of individuals in the presence and absence of DOM. The experiments were performed using B. neritina collected from floating docks in Beaufort, NC, USA from July to September 2004. Seawater was subjected to ultraviolet irradiation to reduce naturally occurring DOM, and then enriched with either 1 mu M of palmitic acid or a mixture containing 1 mu M each of glucose, alanine, aspartic acid and glycine. Larvae in DOM-enriched and DOM-reduced treatments were sampled and induced to metamorphose following 1, 6, 12, and 24 h of continuous swimming at 25 C. Sampled larvae were assessed for initiation of metamorphosis, completion of metamorphosis, and ancestrular lophophore size to determine the extent to which energy acquired from DOM uptake could offset the metabolic costs of prolonged larval swimming. DOM treatment had no significant effect on initiation of metamorphosis, but did have a significant effect on completion of metamorphosis and lophophore size. Larvae swimming in DOM-enriched treatments for 24 h experienced a 20% increase in metamorphic completion rate, compared to larvae swimming for 24 h in the DOM-reduced treatment. In addition, larvae in the amino acid and sugar mixture for 24 h had a significantly larger lophophore surface area and volume (23 and 31%, respectively), compared to larvae in DOM-depleted seawater. To ensure that the increases in performance found in larvae with access to DOM were not due to a decrease in metabolic activity, the respiration rates for these larvae were compared to those of larvae in DOM-depleted seawater. There were no significant differences between these treatments, indicating that the increases in performance were due to the energy acquired from DOM. These results clearly show that for B. neritina, DOM uptake results in increased metamorphic success and in the size of the feeding apparatus following an extended larval swimming duration.																	0025-3162					MAR	2007	151	1					301	311		10.1007/s00227-006-0492-0						WOS:000244485800027		
J	Chen, ZQ; Hu, CM; Comny, RN; Muller-Karger, F; Swarzenski, P				Chen, Zhiqiang; Hu, Chuanmin; Comny, Robyn N.; Muller-Karger, Frank; Swarzenski, Peter			Colored dissolved organic matter in Tampa Bay, Florida	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Absorption and fluorescence of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll and total suspended solids in Tampa Bay and its adjacent rivers were examined in June and October of 2004. Except in Old Tampa Bay (OTB), the spatial distribution of CDOM showed a conservative relationship with salinity in June, 2004 (a(CDOM)(400)=-0.19 x salinity+6.78, R-2=0.98, n=17, salinity range=1.1-32.5) with little variations in absorption spectral slope and fluorescence efficiency. This indicates that CDOM distribution was dominated by mixing. In October, 2004, CDOM distribution was nonconservative with an average absorption coefficient (a(CDOM) (400), similar to 7.76 m(-1)) about seven times higher than that in June (similar to 1.11 m(-1)). The nonconservative behavior was caused largely by CDOM removal at intermediate salinities (e.g., aCDOM(400) removal > 15% at salinity similar to 13.0), which likely resulted from photobleaching due to stronger stratification. The spatial and seasonal distributions of CDOM in Tampa Bay showed that the two largest rivers, the Alafia River (AR) and Hillsborough River (HR) were dominant CDOM sources to most of the bay. In OTB, however, CDOM showed distinctive differences: lower absorption coefficient, higher absorption spectral slopes, and lower ratios of CDOM absorption to DOC and higher fluorescence efficiency. These differences may have stemmed from (1) changes in CDOM composition by more intensive photobleaching due to the longer residence time of water mass in OTB; (2) other sources of CDOM than the HR/AR inputs, such as local creeks, streams, groundwater, and/or bottom re-suspension. Average CDOM absorption in Tampa Bay at 443 nm, a(CDOM)(443), was about five times higher in June and about ten times higher in October than phytoplankton pigment absorption, a(ph)(443), indicating that blue light attenuation in the water column was dominated by CDOM rather than by phytoplankton absorption throughout the year.

J	Gao, YZ; Xiong, W; Ling, WT; Wang, XR; Li, QL				Gao, Yanzheng; Xiong, Wei; Ling, Wanting; Wang, Xiaorong; Li, Qiuling			Impact of exotic and inherent dissolved organic matter on sorption of phenanthrene by soils	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												The impacts of exotic and inherent dissolved organic matter (DOM) on phenanthrene sorption by six zonal soils of China, chosen so as to have different soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, were investigated using a batch technique. The exotic DOM was extracted from straw waste. In all cases, the sorption of phenanthrene by soils could be well described by the linear equation. The presence of inherent DOM in soils was found to impede phenanthrene sorption, since the apparent distribution coefficients (K;) for phenanthrene sorption by deionized water-eluted soils were 3.13-21.5% larger than the distribution coefficients (Kd) by control soils. Moreover, the enhanced sorption of phenanthrene by eluted versus control soils was in positive correlation with SOC contents. On the other hand, it was observed that the influence of exotic DOM on phenanthrene sorption was related to DOM concentrations. The K-d* values for sorption of phenanthrene in the presence of exotic DOM increased first and decreased thereafter with increasing the added DOM concentrations (0-106 mg DOC/L). The K-d* values at a low exotic DOM concentration (< 28 mg DOC/L) were 14.7-48.4% larger than their control Kd values. In contrast, higher concentrations (>= 52 mg DOC/L) of added exotic DOM clearly impeded the distribution of phenanthrene between soil and water. The effects of exotic and inherent DOM on phenanthrene sorption by soils may primarily be described as 'cumulative sorption', association of phenanthene with DOM in solution, and modified surface nature of soil solids due to DOM binding.

In the presence of DOM, Cd sorption capacity decreased markedly for both soils, especially for the copper tailings wasteland. The Cd sorption isotherms could be well described by the Freundlich equation (r(2) = 0.98), and the binding intensity parameter of soils in the presence of fresh manure DOM was lower than compost DOM. An increase in DOM concentration significantly reduced the sorption of Cd by both soils. Within the Cd and DOM concentration range studied, the decrease in Cd sorption caused by fresh manure DOM was consistently greater than that of compost DOM. Moreover, the reduction of Cd sorption caused by DOM was more obvious in the soil with higher pH. In addition, the sorption of Cd increased with an increase in pH for both soils without the addition of DOM, while Cd sorption in the presence of DOM was unexpectedly decreased with an increase in pH at a pH > 6.6.																	1684-5315					FEB 5	2007	6	3					227	234								WOS:000248673500010

J	Doig, LE; Liber, K				Doig, Lorne E.; Liber, Karsten			Nickel speciation in the presence of different sources and fractions of dissolved organic matter	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												This study evaluated nickel (Ni) speciation in the presence of different fractions (humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA)) and sources (natural sediment, Suwannee River, peat moss) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) at Ni concentrations toxicologically relevant to the freshwater amphipod, Hyalella azteca. The free Ni ion, Ni2+, was measured in reconstituted water (with or without DOM) using a miniaturized ion-exchange technique (IET). Ni speciation from these experiments was compared to calculated results obtained from equilibrium modelling (WHAM, Model VI). While it is known that Ni will complex with DOM, it was found that under acutely toxic Ni exposure concentrations ([Ni-Total] = 5 mg/L, or 8 5.1 mu M) representative surface-water DOC concentrations (similar to 10 mg/L) played little or no role in Ni speciation. Conversely, at sublethal Ni exposure concentrations ([Ni-Total] = 0.2 and 0.5 mu g/L, or 3.4 and 8.51 mu M, respectively) DOM significantly affected Ni speciation with [Ni2+] decreasing with increasing concentration of DOM. It was found that for similar concentrations of DOC (same fraction, different sources), the measured Ni2+ concentrations were reduced (relative to the control), but similar to one another. Conversely, at similar DOC concentrations, the HA fraction reduced Ni2+ levels to a greater extent than the associated FA fraction. Overall, this study provides proof of principle that Suwannee River and peat humic substances are suitable analogues for natural sediment pore-water DOM when evaluating Ni bioavailability in freshwater.

Molecular weight and humification index as predictors of adsorption for plant- and manure-derived dissolved organic matter to goethite	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Sorptive retention of organic matter is important in maintaining the fertility and quality of soils in agricultural ecosystems. However, few sorption studies have been conducted that use dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristic of agricultural amendments. We investigated the sorption to goethite (alpha-FeOOH) of DOM extracted from: (i) above-ground biomass of wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.), maize residue (Zea mays L.), soybean residue (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and hairy vetch residue (Vivia billosa L.); (ii) below-ground biomass from maize, soybean, canola (Brassica napus L.), and green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.); and (iii) beef, dairy, poultry, and pig animal manures. The apparent molecular weight (MWAP) of the DOM was measured by high performance-size exclusion chromatography and ranged from 312 to 1074 g mol(-1). The carboxyl-group content of the DOM measured by potentiometric titration ranged from 4.84 to 21.38 mmol((-)) g(-1) carbon. The humification index (HIX) determined by fluorescence spectrometry varied from 1.15 to 4.33. Sorption was directly related to both MWAP and HIX values of the DOM. Molecular weight analysis of the solution prior to and after sorption indicated that the DOM molecules > 1800 g mol(-1) were preferentially sorbed, resulting in fractionation of the DOM upon reaction with goethite. The multiple regression equation, based only on MWAP and HIX parameters, explained 76% of the variance in amount of DOM sorbed. The results indicate that MWAP and HIX are important factors in controlling the sorption of DOM to mineral surfaces. Amendment with materials that release DOM of higher molecular weight and greater humification will result in enhanced initial sorption of DOM to soil solids, thereby contributing to accumulation of a larger soil organic C pool.																	1351-0754					FEB	2007	58	1					125	132		10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00817.x						WOS:000243940900014

Effects of dissolved organic matter and ultraviolet radiation on the accrual, stoichiometry and algal taxonomy of stream periphyton	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We investigated the effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation on periphyton during a 30-day experiment in grazer-free, outdoor artificial streams. We established high [10-12 mg carbon (C) L-1] and low (3-5 mg C L-1) concentrations of DOM in artificial streams exposed to or shielded from ambient UVB radiation. Periphyton was sampled weekly for ash-free dry mass (AFDM), chlorophyll (chl) a , algal biovolume, elemental composition [C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)], and algal taxonomic composition. 2. Regardless of the UVB environment, increased DOM concentration caused greater periphyton AFDM, chl a and total C content during the experiment. Increased DOM also significantly increased periphyton C : P and N : P (but not C : N) ratios throughout the experiment. Algal taxonomic composition was strongly affected by elevated stream DOM concentrations; some algal taxa increased and some decreased in biomass and prevalence in artificial streams receiving DOM additions. UVB removal, on the other hand, did not strongly affect periphyton biomass, elemental composition or algal taxonomic composition for most of the experiment. 3. Our results show strong effects of DOM concentration but few, if any, effects of UVB radiation on periphyton biomass, elemental composition and algal taxonomic composition. The effects of DOM may have resulted from its absorption of UVA radiation, or more likely, its provision of organic C and nutrients to microbial communities. The strong effects of DOM on periphyton biomass and elemental composition indicate that they potentially play a key role in food web dynamics and ecosystem processes in forested streams.																	0046-5070					FEB	2007	52	2					319	330		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01696.x						WOS:000243473600011

The samples used were green leaves, yellow senescent leaves, and leaf litter of Salix gracilistyla Miq., which is the dominant riparian plant species in the middle reaches of rivers in western Japan. We analyzed dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total sugar, and polyphenol in the leachate of leaf samples collected from a fluvial bar in the middle reaches of the Ohtagawa River in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. Considerable leaching of DOC from senescent leaves [37.3 mg g(-1) dry weight (dw) leaf] and leaf litter (8.1 mg g(-1) dw leaf) occurred within 24h after immersion. In contrast, DOC leached from green leaves was negligible until 1 week after leaf immersion. Carbon loss of leaves by leaching within 24h after leaf immersion was estimated to be less than 8%, suggesting that leaching of DOC from S. gracili-styla leaves is a minor pathway through which organic matter is supplied to stream ecosystems. DOM leached from the leaves included sugar and polyphenol, which were among the major chemical forms of DOM leached from the leaves (based on the molecular mass). In a laboratory experiment in which the difference in the stability of DOM between the chemical forms was examined, sugar decomposed more rapidly than polyphenol.																	1341-6979					FEB	2007	12	1					68	74		10.1007/s10310-006-0254-3						WOS:000244503000010		
J	Maie, N; Scully, NM; Pisani, O; Jaffe, R				Maie, Nagamitsu; Scully, Norman M.; Pisani, Oliva; Jaffe, Rudolf			Composition of a protein-like fluorophore of dissolved organic matter in coastal wetland and estuarine ecosystems	WATER RESEARCH												This study demonstrates the compositional heterogeneity of a protein-like fluorescence emission signal (T-peak; excitation/emission maximum at 280/325 nm) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples collected from subtropical river and estuarine environments. Natural water samples were collected from the Florida Coastal Everglades ecosystem. The samples were ultrafiltered and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices were obtained. The T-peak intensity correlated positively with N concentration of the ultrafiltered DOM solution (UDON), although, the low correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.140, p < 0.05) suggested the coexistence of proteins with other classes of compounds in the T-peak. As such, the T-peak was unbundled on size exclusion chromatography. The elution curves showed that the T-peak was composed of two compounds with distinct molecular weights (MW) with nominal MWs of about > 5 x 10(4) (T-1) and similar to 7.6 x 10(3) (T-2) and with varying relative abundance among samples. The T-1-peak intensity correlated strongly with [UDON] (r(2) = 0.516, p < 0.001), while T-2-peak did not, which suggested that the T-peak is composed of a mixture of compounds with different chemical structures and ecological roles, namely proteinaceous materials and presumably phenolic moieties in humic-like substances. Natural source of the latter may include polyphenols leached from senescent plant materials, which are important precursors of humic substances. This idea is supported by the fact that polyphenols, such as gallic acid, an important constituent of hydrolysable tannins, and condensed tannins extracted from red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) leaves exhibited the fluorescence peak in the close vicinity of the T-peak (260/346 and 275/313 nm, respectively). Based on this study the application of the T-peak as a proxy for [DON] in natural waters may have limitations in coastal zones with significant terrestrial DOM input. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Spectrofluorometric properties of dissolved organic matter from Central and Southern Ontario streams and the influence of iron and irradiation	WATER RESEARCH												Fluorescence measurements were used to compare characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from distinctly different origins: boreal, agricultural and urban streams as well as a storm runoff pond and the outlet of a tertiary wastewater treatment plant. The primary goal was to determine if differences among stream types could be detected using DOM fluorescence in lieu of isolated fulvic acids (FA). Differences in peak excitation and peak emission wavelengths, fluorescence integrated over the 3-D matrix volume integrated fluorescence (VIF), and in a fluorescence index (FI) were examined. In general, peak fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths as well as FI best distinguished DOM from the various origins. Results suggested that DOM from the boreal streams was of a higher molecular weight and more complex than that of agricultural and urban streams. The effects of irradiation as well as Fe on fluorescence of natural stream waters were also investigated, both of which decreased the ability of optical properties to distinguish DOM source.

The sorption of Cd and Zn by different soils in the presence of dissolved organic matter from sludge	GEODERMA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the important factors affecting metal mobility and phytotoxicity in the soils receiving sewage sludge. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DOM from anaerobically digested dewatered sludge on Cd and Zn sorption by three different soil types (calcareous clay loam, calcareous sandy loam and acidic sandy loam) of different physico-chemical properties through batch studies. The addition of DOM significantly reduced the Cd and Zn sorption capacity by a factor of 2.1-5.7 for Cd and 2.3-13.7 for Zn for these three soils as seen by their K values in the Freundlich equation compared to the control receiving no DOM, suggesting that DOM had a stronger inhibitory effect on Zn sorption than that of Cd. The reduction in metal sorption caused by DOM was very apparent in the pH range of 5 to 8, with a maximum inhibition on metal sorption occurring at pH 7-7.5 especially for Zn but the effect was minimal at lower pH. At a DOM concentration of < 200 mg C 1(-1), Cd and Zn sorption by all the three soils decreased with an increase in DOM concentration. At each given DOM concentration, the inhibition of metal sorption of the different soil types increased in the following order: acidic sandy loam < calcareous sandy loam < calcareous clay loam. DOM derived from sludge would significantly reduce metal sorption and increase its mobility through the formation of soluble DOM-metal complexes and poses risk of metal leaching and phytotoxicty in near-neutral and alkaline soils.

J	Biers, EJ; Zepp, RG; Moran, MA				Biers, Erin J.; Zepp, Richard G.; Moran, Mary Ann			The role of nitrogen in chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter formation	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Microbial and photochemical processes affect chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dynamics in the ocean. Some evidence suggests that dissolved nitrogen plays a role in CDOM formation, although this has received little systematic attention in marine ecosystems. Coastal seawater incubations were carried out in the presence of model dissolved organic nitrogen (DON: amino sugars and amino acids) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) compounds to assess their role in biological and photochemical production of CDOM. For several of the dissolved N compounds, microbial processing resulted in a pulse of CDOM that was mainly labile, appearing and disappearing within 7 days. In contrast, a net loss of CDOM occurred when no N was added to the microbial incubations. The greatest net biological CDOM formation was found upon addition of amino sugars (formation of fluorescent, mostly labile CDOM) and tryptophan (formation of non-fluorescent, refractory CDOM). Photochemical formation of CDOM was only found with tryptophan, the one aromatic compound tested. This CDOM was highly fluorescent, with excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) resembling those of terrestrial, humic-like fluorophores. The heterogeneity in CDOM formation from this collection of labile N-containing compounds was surprising. These compounds are common components of biopolymers and humic substances in natural waters and likely to contribute to microbially- and photochemically-produced CDOM in coastal seawater.

Contrasting complexing capacity of dissolved organic matter produced during the onset, development and decay of a simulated bloom of the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The capacity of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced during the onset, development and decay of a simulated bloom of the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum to complex free copper has been followed for a 2 week period. Copper binding capacity of the culture was measured by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) with a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and two fluorophores, M (humic-like, Ex/Em: 320 nm/410 nm) and T (protein-like, Ex/Em: 280 nm/350 nm), were followed during the course of the incubation. Models using DOC concentrations alone could not accurately predict the complexing capacity of the culture, especially at the end of the bloom, and better predictions were obtained when fluorescence measurements were considered. They were helpful in charactenising two types of copper ligands produced in the culture. The first type, traced by the fluorescence of peak T, was related to labile DOC directly exuded by phytoplankton. The second type, traced by the fluorescence of peak M, was the refractory humic-like material presumably produced in situ as a by-product of the bacterial degradation of phyrogenic materials. During the onset and development of the bloom (days 0 to 7), the fluorescence of peak T explains 60-80% of the total complexing capacity of the culture, suggesting that exuded "protein-like" compounds among other exuded complexing agents efficiently complexed free copper. On the contrary, during the decay (days 8 to 13), these ligands were replaced by humic substances as the complexing agent for copper. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Temporal variability in the composition and abundance of terrestrially-derived dissolved organic matter in the lower Mississippi and Pearl Rivers	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Here we report on temporal changes in the concentration and composition of lignin phenols in high molecular weight (< 0.2 mu m, > 1 kDa) dissolved organic matter (HMW DOM) collected from the lower Mississippi and Pearl Rivers (MR and PR) (USA). Monthly water samples were collected at a station in the lower reach in each river from August 2001 to August 2003. Significantly higher concentrations of lignin and As values (mg lignin phenols in 100 mg organic carbon) in the Pearl River than in the Mississippi River, reflected sporadic inputs of terrestrial DOM during rainstorm events from wetlands and forest soils. Larger seasonal variations in lignin concentration and composition in the Pearl River, compared to the Mississippi River, were attributed to shifts in organic matter sources from topsoil inputs during rainstorm events to groundwater inputs and in situ production during base flow in this small river. Conversely, lower Lambda(8) and vanillic acid to vanillin ratios [(Ad/Al)v] in the HMW DOM of the lower Mississippi River may be a result of a lower export rate of lignin from agricultural soils due to lower carbon storage in the expansive agricultural systems of the Mississippi River watershed, as well as dilution of phytoplankton DOM inputs. Large seasonal changes in lignin concentration and As (linked at times with river discharge), and minimal variability in the composition of lignin phenols, likely represented an integrated signal of soil-derived vascular inputs from the upstream drainage basin. If we are to better understand the controls of organic matter delivery to the coastal zone from both small and large rivers, sampling strategies need to be adjusted to account for the different scales of hydrologic response time and in situ processing associated with different residence times.

Ramesh			The use of senescent plant biomass to investigate relationships between potential particulate and dissolved organic matter in a wetland ecosystem	AQUATIC BOTANY												The purpose of this research was to (1) determine if different species of wetland vegetation produced characteristically different dissolved organic matter (DOM) based upon both chemical and physical characteristics and (2) determine if any relationships exist between characteristics of DOM derived from freshly senescent tissues of different wetland plant species common to the Florida Everglades and characteristics of the senescent plant tissue itself. Senescent plant tissues were used to represent potential particulate organic matter (POM) and leachates derived from them through cold water extraction were used to simulate abiotically produced labile DOM. Leachate DOM was characterized by total phosphorus (TP), nitrogen (TN), and carbon (TC), total carbohydrate content (TCC), total phenolic content (TPC), E4/E6 ratios, stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) and molecular mass fractionation (MMF). Senescent plant tissue (POM) was characterized by TP, TN, TC, E4/E6 ratio, stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15), and fiber fractionation analysis (soluble content, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin). Comparisons of DOM mean values for MMF, TCC, and TPC among species revealed significant differences, which was further supported by observed separation of species in principal components analysis. Regression analysis between POM and DOM characteristics suggests that POM N:P ratios are useful predictors of DOM N:P ratios (r = 0.83, P < 0.001) and that POM levels of soluble constituents and hemicellulose can be a significant predictors of DOM TC (r(2) = 0.82, P < 0.001). Comparisons of E4/E6 ratios and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) of DOM and POM, however, did not reveal significant relationships. The results of this study suggest that plant community structure may be a significant modulator of DOM quality and quantity through species specific contributions of characteristically different DOM and that plant tissue concentrations of nutrients and structural components can significantly influence chemical characteristics of DOM derived from them.

J	Minor, EC; Dalzell, BL; Stubbins, A; Mopper, K				Minor, Elizabeth C.; Dalzell, Brent L.; Stubbins, Aron; Mopper, Kenneth			Evaluating the photoalteration of estuarine dissolved organic matter using direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectroscopy	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS) was used to evaluate the molecular-level photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from three sites in a Chesapeake Bay subestuary (swamp- and marsh-influenced up-river, midestuarine, and bay mouth). From each site, filtered (<0.1 or <0.2 mu m) water samples were irradiated in solar-simulated ultraviolet light followed by isolation of the DOM using C-18-solid-phase extraction and subsequent DT-MS analysis. To provide background DOM photoreactivity data for the water samples, we also determined dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) photoproduction and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photobleaching. DIC photoproduction was correlated with initial DOM light absorbance, initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and photobleaching. Changes in DT-MS characteristics within the extracts (in particular, the loss of an "aromatic" signal believed to be from reworked terrestrial material) were found to correlate linearly with the absorbance of the corresponding water samples. A relationship between photobleaching and DT-MS characteristics was also observed, with the upstream samples asymptotically approaching a constant "molecular-level" value as photobleaching increased. Both relationships appeared to be independent of absorbance wavelength in the ultraviolet. Following irradiation, the swamp/marsh-dominated upstream samples resembled the down-stream samples in terms of absorption spectra and MS-determined molecular-level characteristics. These shifts indicate that terrestrially-derived DOM may be more difficult to differentiate from marine DOM upon photodegradation, which has implications regarding evaluating the terrestrial impact within the marine DOM pool.

We determined electron acceptor and donor capacities (EAC and EDC) of a peat humic acid and an untreated peat DOM by electrochemical reduction and reduction with metallic Zn and H2S (EAC), and by oxidation with complexed ferric iron (EDC) at pH 6.5. DOC concentrations (10-100 mg L-1) and pH values (4.5-8) were varied in selected experiments. EAC reached up to 6.2 mequiv center dot(g C)(-1) and EDC reached up to 1.52 mequiv center dot(g C)(-1). EDC decreased with pH and conversion of chelated to colloidal iron, and the electron-transfer capacity (ETC) was controlled by the redox potential E-h of the reactant (ETC = 1.016 center dot E-h - 0.138; R (2) = 0.87; p = 0.05). The kinetics could be adequately described by pseudo first-order rate laws, one or two DOM pools, and time constants ranging from 2.1 x 10(-3) d(-1) to 1.9 x 10(-2) d(-1) for the fast pool. Reactions were completed after 24-160 h depending on the redox couple applied. The results indicate that DOM may act as a redox buffer over electrochemical potentials ranging from -0.9 to +1.0 V.

J	Wang, LS; Hu, HY; Wang, C				Wang, Li-Sha; Hu, Hong-Ying; Wang, Chao			Effect of ammonia nitrogen and dissolved organic matter fractions on the genotoxicity of wastewater effluent during chlorine disinfection	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Chlorine is a widely used disinfectant which prevents the spread of harmful pathogens when reusing wastewater, but harmful byproducts might be formed and cause adverse ecological and health effects. In this study, the potential effects of chlorination on the genotoxicity of different biologically treated wastewater samples were investigated using the umu test. For the first time, ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) was found to significantly influence genotoxicity during wastewater chlorination. After chlorination, the genotoxicity decreased in wastewater with a low NH3N concentration (< 10 similar to 20 mg/L), but it increased notably in wastewater with a high NH3N concentration (> 10 similar to 20 mg/L). By fractionating the DOM (dissolved organic matter) in wastewater into different fractions, it was found that the hydrophilic substances (HIS) fraction of DOM was the key fraction involved in decreasing genotoxicity during the chlorination of wastewater with a low NH3N concentration, while the hydrophobic acids (HOA) fraction of DOM was the key fraction involved in increasing genotoxicity during chlorination of wastewater with a high NH3N concentration. Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy analysis on different fractions indicated that some free or combined aromatic amino acids might produce highly genotoxic byproducts during the chlorination of wastewater with a high NH3N content, and this was then demonstrated through experiments on the chlorination of free aromatic amino acids.																	0013-936X					JAN 1	2007	41	1					160	165		10.1021/es0616635						WOS:000243124600029	17265942

Solar irradiation caused a decrease in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and in the fluorescence peak intensity (FI) of fulvic acid (FA)- and protein-like substances in DOM. Mineralization of DOC during an irradiation period (13 days) was observed to be higher in upstream samples (32-36%) compared to that in downstream sample (16%). DOC concentration in samples stored in the dark significantly decreased in the downstream sample (16%), while those in upstream samples hardly decreased (1-8%). The FI of FA-like substance decreased by 72-84% during 13-days irradiation (integrated solar intensity = 176 MJ m(-2)). The protein-like fluorescence was only observed in the downstream sample and the net decrease in the FI was 59% in the irradiated sample. The first-order reaction kinetics was applied to analyze the photo degradation of DOM. Two-step photodegradation was suggested for the fluorescent DOM (FDOM), while not for the DOC. Results obtained here suggested that FA-like FDOM is more susceptible to photodegradation compared with those of protein-like substances and DOC.																	0016-7002	1880-5973					2007	41	5					323	331								WOS:000251386200002

Bryan			Influence of decomposition on chemical properties of plant- and manure-derived dissolved organic matter and sorption to goethite	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Sorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in maintaining the fertility and quality of soils in agricultural ecosystems. Few studies have examined the effects of decomposition on DOM sorption and chemical characteristics. This study investigated the sorption to goethite (alpha-FeOOH) of fresh and decomposed hydrophilic (HPL) and hydrophobic (HPB) DOM fractions extracted from the shoots and roots of crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L), and dairy and poultry manures. Sorption was positively related to apparent molecular weight (MWAP), aromaticity as measured by absorptivity at 280 nm, and phenolic acid content. A 10-d laboratory microbial decomposition of the source organic matter generally increased the sorption of the extracted DOM onto goethite. The decomposition effect on sorption was greater for the HPL fractions than for the HPB fractions. There was a decrease in the MWAP values of the DOM samples following sorption to goethite. In many cases the reduction in MWAP was large, indicating a strong preference by goethite for the higher MWAP DOM fractions. The results of this laboratory-based research demonstrate that microbial processes affect the chemical characteristics of DOM which may affect the distribution of soil organic C pools.

Adsorption kinetics of natural dissolved organic matter and its impact on arsenic(V) leachability from arsenic-loaded ferrihydrite and Al-ferrihydrite	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The present work was broadly divided into two parts: first, the efficiency of synthetically prepared ferrihydrite and Al-ferrihydrite to adsorb dissolved organic matter (DOM) was tested as a function of time, pH and ionic strength and its effects on specific surface area was found. In the second part, the effect of DOM concentration and solution pH was studied to elucidate the influence of this two parameters on As(V) leachability from As(V) loaded ferrihydrite and Al-ferrihydrite. It was found that both pH and ionic strength had significant influence on DOM adsorption. The behavior and magnitude of adsorption was significantly different for both the materials. In general, the efficiency of Al-ferrihydrite to adsorb DOM was better compared to ferrihydrite. Results indicated that ligand exchange was the dominant interaction mechanism for DOM adsorption on ferrihydrite and Al-ferrihydrite. The study also suggested a strong potential for DOM to mobilize As(V) from the studied materials. At pH 5.0, DOM concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg C/L had negligible effect on As(V) leachability. With increasing DOM concentration from 10 to 30 mg C/L, increased the As(V) leachability into the solution. Net release from ferrihydrite was up to 1.07 mg/g (5.75%) of the total adsorbed arsenic. The corresponding figure for Al-ferrihydrite was 1.47 mg/g (6.30%). As the primary mechanisms for the arsenic release from solid phases we identified two different types of mechanisms i.e., dissolution of the solid phase and competition between arsenic and organic anions for sorption sites.																	1093-4529					JAN	2007	42	1					81	88		10.1080/10934520601015792						WOS:000242347400012	17129952

The adsorption kinetics follows the first-order rate law while the adsorption thermodynamics indicates the exothermic and spontaneous nature. A comparative study on the adsorption/desorption properties of NDOM between CNTs and granular activated carbon (GAC) was also conducted and revealed that the CNTs possess more NDOM adsorption capacities and show less weight loss through 10 cycles of water treatment and reactivation than the GAC. This suggests that the CNTs are promising NDOM adsorbents for preventing the microbiological degradation of drinking water quality as well as the formation of disinfection by products in water treatment.

Surface water samples from 26 sampling sites of Taihu Lake were collected. Furthermore wet chemical analysis (CODCr and BOD5) and measurement of three dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3DEEM) spectra in the laboratory have been conducted. Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model, three components of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been identified successfully, based on the analysis of 3DEEM data. The characteristics of the three components also have been described by comparing them to some components of CDOM, identified in earlier researches. Meanwhile, spatial variations of concentration for the three components in Taihu Lake have been analyzed, and the result indicates that the concentration of component 1 depends more on the situation of wastewater pollution and can be used as the indicator of wastewater pollution. The relationship between the concentrations of the three components and results of the wet chemical analysis show that none of the three components can be used as indicators of gross organic matter in water. However, the concentrations of all the three components have obvious linear relationships with the BOD5 value, especially for component 1 (r = 0.72878). Finally, the potential applications of the composition analysis based on 3DEEM and PARAFAC model in water quality monitoring have been illuminated.

Assessment of anthropogenic influences on copper complexation by aquatic 44 dissolved organic matter using synchronous fluorescence	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Anthropogenic influences on the characteristics of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) were evaluated in this work using synchronous fluorescence (SyF) scan spectroscopy. Samples from the Iraf and the Iguacu Rivers were collected during the summer and winter at points located upstream and downstream from a heavily urbanized area in Brazil, respectively. DOM from all samples was titrated with Cu2+ and monitored by SyF quenching. A 1:1 non linear model was used for data treatment in, at least, five distinct regions of the spectra. Results revealed that during the rainy summer, DOM from both rivers exhibited simple organic structures such as aromatic amino acids or conjugated aliphatics as the major constituents, probably arising from non-point sources. However, during the dry winter it became clear that raw sewage discharges arising from the urbanized area contributed to an increase of fluorescent organic matter that is unable to complex copper.

There were distinct maxima close to the sediment-water interface of these constituents at all times of the year. The very high diffusive effluxes calculated from these pore-water distributions were not compatible with simultaneous sediment trap measurements of particulate organic carbon, nitrogen, and carbohydrate fluxes toward the seafloor. Effluxes calculated from pore-water DOC distributions in recovered cores from another Atlantic deep-sea site, showing almost identical maxima as those at PAP, were more than an order of magnitude greater than simultaneous in situ chamber DOC flux measurements. We suggest that the dissolved organic matter maxima are predominantly artifacts induced by lysis of, or leakage from, mainly bacterial biomass resulting from decompression and/or warming during recovery of the sediment cores from the abyssal seafloor. Temperature elevation during core recovery from the abyss gives a N-2 saturation of about 150%, and the combined effect of warming and decompression results in a CO2 saturation of about 135%, which together plausibly are associated with bubble formation creating cell bursting. Previous estimates of microbial biomass in abyssal sediments may be underestimates because of the difficulty of counting lysed bacterial cells. Since exoenzymes are inducible, previous measurements of their activities in recovered abyssal sediments may be overestimates.

Variation in colloidal chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Damariscotta Estuary, Maine	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The relationship between chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), colloidal DOM (> 1 kDa), and phytoplankton biomass in marine waters of the Damariscotta estuary, Maine, was studied using flow field-flow fractionation (flow FFF). The goal was to determine whether temporal variability in CDOM in this region is due in part to rapid cycling of marine colloids. CDOM absorption of filtered (0.2 mu m) seawater correlated positively with colloidal absorbance (r(2) = 0.772, p = 0.021). We observed changes in colloidal size spectra and CDOM optical properties associated with phytoplankton biomass. In particular, a significant positive correlation was found between the < 18 kDa colloidal fraction and chlorophyll a (Chl a) (r(2) = 0.819, p = 0.013). While we did not find significant relationships between Chl a and either CDOM absorption or the spectral slope of filtered seawater (r(2) and p values of 0.079, 0.590 and 0.111, 0.519, respectively), we did observe patterns of higher CDOM absorption and spectral slopes following periods of increased phytoplankton biomass. The spectral slope of colloidal material often was significantly lower than that of filtered seawater and normally varied significantly with colloidal size. These findings show that colloidal processes can contribute to CDOM optical signatures in coastal waters.																	0024-3590					JAN	2007	52	1					32	45								WOS:000243795400004

Effects of upstream lakes on dissolved organic matter in streams	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the effects of upstream lakes on dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and the absorbance of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the streams of northern Michigan. We assessed DOM concentration and absorbance in 15 streams with upstream lakes and 17 streams without upstream lakes located in the same geographic region in May and August 2003. In addition, we estimated watershed land cover and morphology to assess the possibility that other landscape variables could account for DOM differences between the two stream types. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon, its UVB absorbance, and its molar absorbtivity (absorbance per unit carbon) were all significantly lower in streams with upstream lakes than in streams with no lakes. Strong predictive relationships existed between upstream watershed metrics and stream DOM properties, but varied by season and the presence of upstream lakes. DOM quantity and UV-absorbing ability were related to different watershed metrics, with DOM quantity being strongly related to terrestrial watershed metrics, whereas UV-absorbing ability was most strongly related to percent water surface area. Upstream lakes strongly influence downstream DOM potentially because of their long water residence times, which could increase opportunities for DOM processing. Upstream lakes represent a strong landscape predictor of stream DOM properties that is not directly tied to terrestrial DOM sources and processing.

Dissolved organic matter and persistence of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) under low food conditions	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To determine whether the ability of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) to absorb and metabolize a variety of dissolved organic compounds allows them to persist when food levels are too low to sustain them, we compared how quickly starving mussels lost weight when kept in water with and without natural dissolved organic matter (DOM). Mussels fed a starvation ration of algae were maintained either in filtered Hudson River water or in ultraviolet-treated deionized water with major ions added at concentrations equivalent to those in the Hudson. Both types of water were continually filtered. Zebra mussels lost weight two- to fivefold faster in the absence of natural DOM, consistent with the idea that the uptake of DOM provides a substantial metabolic subsidy to these organisms. Ingestion of bacteria could not account for this effect. We calculate that the DOM subsidy amounted to more than half of the zebra mussel respiratory requirement under the experimental conditions, which is enough to double the length of time that zebra mussels can survive in the complete absence of particulate food. The effect of DOM on zebra mussel metabolism is 1.5- to fourfold larger than that predicted solely from estimates of amino and fatty acid uptake in the Hudson River. Because Hudson River DOM is largely allochthonous in origin, this subsidy could give zebra mussels a distinct advantage over other organisms competing for phytoplankton resources. We postulate that zebra mussels will have the largest effects on freshwater ecosystems that receive substantial inputs of organic matter from the surrounding watershed.																	0024-3590					JAN	2007	52	1					70	78								WOS:000243795400007		
J	Vahatalo, AV; Jarvinen, M				Vahatalo, Anssi V.; Jarvinen, Marko			Photochemically produced bioavailable nitrogen from biologically recalcitrant dissolved organic matter stimulates production of a nitrogen-limited microbial food web in the Baltic Sea	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Experiments were designed to assess whether the photochemical production of bioavailable nitrogen (N) from biologically recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) stimulates growth of N-limited plankton. Filtered Baltic Sea water was exposed to solar radiation for 12-19 days. Along with dark controls, samples were inoculated with an indigenous nanoplankton (< 10 mu m) community and incubated under photosynthetically active radiation and N-limiting conditions (molar dissolved inorganic nitrogen to PO43- ratio of 0.2). The concentration of particulate nitrogen, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and the biomass of phytoplankton and protozoa increased more in the solar radiation-exposed waters than in dark controls, showing that the photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) supported both heterotrophic and autotrophic plankton. In order to calculate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for the photochemical reactions, the experimentally determined photoproduced bioavailable N (the formed particulate N and mineralized DON) and the phytoplankton biomass stimulated by DOM photochemistry were related to the number of photons absorbed by chromophoric DOM. Model calculations based on AQY indicated that DOM photochemistry produces 2226 mu mol bioavailable N m(-2) d(-1) and stimulates phytoplankton biomass by 12-14 mu g Chl a m(-2) d(-1) during summer in the northern Baltic Sea. Photoproduced bioavailable N potentially supports 1.2% and 3.6% of the new primary production and its N-demand, respectively, in this study region during summer. In N-limited surface waters, the photoproduction of bioavailable N from biologically recalcitrant, but photoreactive DOM can provide a new source of N and sustain the background productivity of a nanoplankton community, including phytoplankton.																	0024-3590					JAN	2007	52	1					132	143								WOS:000243795400013

Characterization of methyl sugars, 3-deoxysugars and methyl deoxysugars in marine high molecular weight dissolved organic matter	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy shows that > 50% of the carbon in marine high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM) from surface waters is a compositionally well-defined family of acylated polysaccharides that is conserved across ocean basins. However, acid hydrolysis of HMWDOM, followed by chromatographic analysis, recovers only 10-20% of the carbon as neutral, amino and acidic sugars. Most carbohydrate in HMWDOM therefore remains uncharacterized. Here, we use acid hydrolysis followed by Ag+ and Pb2+ cation exchange chromatography to separate HMWDOM hydrolysis products for characterization using 1-D and 2-D NMR spectroscopy. In addition to neutral sugars identified in past studies, we find 3-O-methylglucose, 3-O-methylrhamnose, 2-O-methylrhamnose and 2-O-methylfucose. We also find 3-deoxysugars to be present, although their complete structures could not be determined. Methyl sugars are widely distributed in plant and bacterial structural carbohydrates, such as cell wall polysaccharides, and their presence in HMWDOM suggests that structural carbohydrates may contribute to DOM in surface seawater. We find most HMWDOM carbohydrate is not depolymerized by acid hydrolysis and that the non-hydrolyzable component includes 6-deoxysugars. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Precipitation of dissolved organic matter by aluminum stabilizes carbon in acidic forest soils	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often neglected as a factor in the formation of stable soil organic matter (OM). Precipitation of DOM by dissolved Al could contribute substantially to C retention in acidic forest soils; however, no information is available on the stability of precipitated OM against microbial decay. We investigated the stability of Al-OM precipitates against microbial decay as related to (i) DOM composition, (ii) Al speciation, and (iii) the dissolved Al/C ratio. We produced Al-OM precipitates by adding AlCl3 (molar Al/C ratios: 0.05-0.3) at pH values of 3.8 and 4.5 to DOM solutions derived from Oi and Oa horizons, from either beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) or spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] litter. Between 13 and 84% of the C was precipitated, depending on pH, Al/C ratio, and the type of DOM. Precipitates were found to be enriched in aromatic C and mostly depleted in N when compared with DOM. Only 0.5 to 7.7% of precipitated C was mineralized during 7 wk of incubation. Mineralization of Al-OM precipitates was up to 28 times less than that of the respective DOM solutions. The extent of mineralization of Al-OM precipitates formed at pH 3.8 was reduced by 50 to 75% when compared with those formed at pH 4.5. The stability of precipitates against microbial decay increased with larger aromatic C content and larger C/N ratios. Our study clearly demonstrated that a large fraction of DOM can be precipitated and is thereby substantially stabilized against microbial decay.

The apparent molecular weights of the 8 fractions were calibrated using high-performance size exclusion chromatograph (HPSEC) and they ranged from 0.36 to 182.6 kDa. These fractionated isolates and the raw water were disinfected by chlorine or chlorine dioxide to determine their disinfection characteristics. Results showed that apparent molecular weight of the main dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the RO isolate of water sample was less than 360 Da and this part of the DOM was mainly from anthropogenic activities and contamination of wastewater. RO fraction was the controlling factor for the raw water disinfection process according to the THMs concentrations detected. Disinfection by chlorine dioxide produced less THMs that by chlorine.																	1606-9749		978-1-84339-611-6				2007	7	2					205	212		10.2166/ws.2007.055						WOS:000249647600021		
J	Lam, B; Simpson, AJ				Lam, Buuan; Simpson, Andre J.			Passive sampler for dissolved organic matter in freshwater environments	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A passive sampler for the isolation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from freshwater environments is described. The sampler consists of a molecular weight selective membrane ( 1000 kDa) and an anion exchange resin (diethylaminoethylcellulose (DEAE-cellulose)). NMR indicates the samplers isolate DOM that is nearly indistinguishable from that isolated using the batch DEAE-cellulose procedure. In a comparative study DOM isolated from Lake Ontario cost similar to$ 0.30/mg to isolate using the passive samplers while DOM isolated using the traditional batch procedure cost similar to$ 8- 10/mg. The samplers have been shown to be effective in a range of freshwater environments including a large inland lake ( Lake Ontario), fast flowing tributary, and wetland. Large amounts ( gram quantities of DOM) can be easily isolated by increasing the size or number of samplers deployed. Samplers are easy to construct, negate the need for pressure filtering, and also permit a range of temporal and spatial experiments that would be very difficult or impossible to perform using conventional approaches. For example, DOM can be monitored on a regular basis at numerous different locations, or samplers could be set at different depths in large lakes. Furthermore, they could potentially be deployed into hard to reach environments such as wells, groundwater aquifers, etc., and as they are easy to use, they can be mailed to colleagues or included with expeditions going to difficult to reach places such as the Arctic and Antarctic.																	0003-2700					DEC 15	2006	78	24					8194	8199		10.1021/ac0608523						WOS:000242824900004	17165807

Multiple observations show that fluorescence intensity of pyrene-EDOM solutions is non-linearly related to pyrene concentration, with distinct concave-up dependence. Testing the effect of pyrene concentration on fluorescence intensity of pyrene-EDOM solutions provides a tool to examine whether binding of an organic compound to EDOM follows linear or non-linear isotherm. Possible coupling between static and dynamic quenching effects was addressed while analyzing fluorescence data. Limited number of EDOM binding sites results in a non-linear binding isotherm such that the concept of pyrene "partitioning" between aqueous phase and "bulky" EDOM organic phase is hardly relevant. Maximal EDOM capacity for pyrene binding is estimated approximately as 0.1% w w(-1). Examination of the differences between the total fluorescence intensity of pyrene-EDOM solution and the fluorescence intensities of separated constituents (pyrene and EDOM) was used to illustrate the accumulation of pyrene-EDOM complexes and saturation of some EDOM binding sites. Strong interactions between pyrene and EDOM binding sites may result in pyrene distribution coefficients differing at least by a factor 3.5-7 at varying pyrene concentrations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lou, T; Xie, HX				Lou, Tao; Xie, Huixiang			Photochemical alteration of the molecular weight of dissolved organic matter	CHEMOSPHERE												Molecular weight (MW) is a key control on the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of dissolved organic mater (DOM). This study investigated the effect of photooxidation on the average MW of DOM by exposing DOM of diverse origins to simulated solar radiation at varying levels of dissolved oxygen and under different incident light wavelength regimes. During irradiation, high-molecular-weight fractions were destroyed and low-molecular-weight constituents were formed. The average MW decreased with irradiation time in all treatments in a manner that can be described by a quasi-exponential function, which suggests that solar radiation is incapable of completely mineralizing DOM even after prolonged exposure. Increasing the oxygen concentration accelerated the MW reduction while the removal of oxygen strongly suppressed this process. The fractional contributions from UV-B, UV-A, and visible radiations to full-spectrum photoinduced MW reduction varied considerably among the DOM samples examined, ranging from 19% to 60%, 17% to 36%, and 15% to 46%. respectively. The MW changes in time-series irradiations were inversely correlated with the ratio of the absorbance at 250 nm to that at 365 nm (i.e., the E(2)/E(3) quotient). Photoinduced MW reduction was accompanied by a decrease of polydispersity, which is indicative of a reduced DOM heterogeneity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the ability of multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to provide detailed chemical information on the preferential sorption of higher-molecular-weight components of natural organic matter onto mineral surfaces. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soil organic horizons and tree leaf tissues was obtained using water extracts. The suite of fluorescence spectra was modeled with PARAFAC and it was revealed that the DOM extracts contained five fluorescing components: tryptophan-like (peak location at excitation < 255 nm:emission 342 nm), tyrosine-like (276 nm:312 nm), and three humic-substance-like components (< 255 nm:456 nm, 309 nm:426 nm, < 255 nm:401 run). In general, adsorption onto goethite and gibbsite increased with increasing DOM molecular weight and humification. PARAFAC analysis of the pre- and post-sorption DOM indicated that the ordering of sorption extent was humic-like components (average 91% sorption) > tryptophan-like components (52% sorption) > tyrosine-like components (29% sorption). This differential sorption of the modeled DOM components in both the soil organic horizon and leaf tissue extracts led to the fractionation of DOM. The results of this study demonstrate that multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy combined with PARAFAC can quantitatively describe the chemical fractionation process due to the interaction of DOM with mineral surfaces.

Biomass accrual was measured after three weeks as chlorophyll a (chl a). In 2003 HA + P and WE + P treatments had higher chl a than controls (P only), but the sucrose + P treatment did not differ from the control treatment. In 2004 the WE treatment was significantly lower than the control treatment and all other treatments, suggesting that WE inhibited biomass accrual. The control treatment was higher than the macronutrients + P, and the HA + P treatments but not significantly so. The control treatment was not significantly different from the trace metals + P treatment, which in turn was significantly higher than all other treatments. One of the control replicates was very high and this apparently caused this unusual result. In 2005 there was no significant difference between treatments, including the control treatment ( P alone), ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) + P, EDTA + iron (Fe) + P and EDTA + HA + P. Stimulation of biomass accrual by Fe could not be demonstrated. In summary HA does seem to promote biomass accrual at this site, although the mechanism of that stimulation remains elusive.																	0270-5060					DEC	2006	21	4					613	620		10.1080/02705060.2006.9664122						WOS:000242201300008

J	Heitmann, T; Blodau, C				Heitmann, Tobias; Blodau, Christian			Oxidation and incorporation of hydrogen sulfide by dissolved organic matter	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Redox reactions of sulfide with dissolved organic matter (DOM) are potentially important for sulfur cycling in anoxic environments. We investigated the chemical oxidation of H2S With a peat humic acid in batch experiments at pH 6, quantified the electron accepting capacity (EAC), and applied a first order kinetic model to estimate reaction constants. Dissolved ferric iron was used to quantify electron donating capacities (EDC). Hydrogen sulfide was oxidized to thiosulfate and also incorporated into DOM. Fourier-transformed infi-ared (FTIR) spectroscopy suggested formation of aryl polysulfide. Electron transfer was significantly correlated to DOM concentration and amounted to 0.60 (EAC) and 0.63 (EDC) meq g(-1) C. DOM concentrations > 60 mgl(-1) lead to decreased capacities per unit mass carbon. The overall reaction of sulfide with DOM could be adequately described by a kinetic model comprising a redox-active and an Sincorporating DOM pool. The overall reaction was fast, with H2S half-lives on the order of several hours. The results suggest that DOM may chemically reoxidize H2S in organic rich soils and sediments at significant rates.

UV-dependent processes are likely to accelerate as a result of shrinking sea ice extent and decreasing ice thickness caused by climatic warming over this region. In this study, we made the first quantitative estimates of photomineralization of tDOM in a coastal Arctic ecosystem under current and future sea ice regimes. We used an optical-photochemical coupled model incorporating water column optics and experimental measurements of photoproduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), the main carbon product of DOM photochemistry. Apparent quantum yields of DIC photoproduction were determined on water samples from the Mackenzie River estuary, the Mackenzie Shelf, and Amundsen Gulf. UV irradiances just below the sea surface were estimated by combining satellite backscattered and passive microwave radiance measurements with a radiative transfer model. The mean annual DIC photoproduction between 1979 and 2003 was estimated as 66.5 +/- 18.5 Gg carbon in the surface waters of the southeastern Beaufort Sea, where UV absorption is dominated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter discharged by the Mackenzie River. This value is equivalent to 10% of bacterial respiration rates, 8% of new primary production rates and 2.8 +/- 0.6% of the 1.3 Tg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) discharged annually by the Mackenzie River into the area. During periods of reduced ice cover such as 1998, the latter value could rise to 5.1% of the annual riverine DOC discharge. Under an ice-free scenario, the model predicted that 150.5 Gg of DIC would be photochemically produced, mineralizing 6.2% of the DOC input from the Mackenzie River. These results show that the predicted trend of ongoing contraction of sea ice cover will greatly accelerate the photomineralization of tDOM in Arctic surface waters.

DOC exhibited a high concentration at the sediment-water interface with a rapid decrease to the oxic-anoxic interface at approximately 7 cm, and then increased with depth. Similar trends were also found for the UV absorption coefficients at 254 and 280 nm in the porewaters. DNA in the sediment was also measured, which confirmed the high abundance of aerobic bacteria in the upper layer of the sediment. Both humic-like (peaks A and C) and protein-like (peaks B and D) fluorescence were observed in the porewater DOM, and their fluorescence intensities exhibited a similar porewater profile as DOC concentration. A strong correlation was found between the peak fluorescence intensity ratio r(A, C) and r(D, B). Both the fluorescence index and UV absorption coefficient at 254 nm suggested a dramatic increase in aromaticity of porewater DOM across the oxic-anoxic interface. Porewater DOM exhibited a multimodal distribution of molecular weight with a relatively low polydispersity. The results of this study offer significant insight into the nature and properties of DOM in freshwater ecosystems.

Moreover, a simple experiment was carried out to assess the DOM consumption by bacteria. At the two sampling stations, we observed changes in the concentrations of the different DOM types over time, related to the phytoplanktonic development (up to 5 mu g l(-1) of chlorophyll-a) and decrease (below 2 mu g l(-1) of chlorophyll-a within 10 days). A significant correlation was observed between the chlorophyll-a and the DOM. The proteinlike signal ranged from maximum values higher than 5 mg F 1 at the beginning of the sampling period to values lower than 2 mg l(-1) at the end. Similarly, the humiclike compounds ranged from the highest values at the beginning (more than 30 mu g l(-1)) to values lower than 20 mu g l(-1) at the end of the sampling time. The dissolved proteins also showed notable changes over time, showing the highest values (more than 0.4 mg l(-1)) during the first days of the sampling period and reduced concentrations (variable, but also below 0.05 mg l(-1)) at the end. Due to the stability of the water column and of the meteorological conditions, we propose major roles for photodestruction and bacterial consumption in the potential "disappearance" of the DOM. The surface layer photodestruction (calculated extrapolating the rates from previous literature data) might explain the disappearance of 7% of the fluorescent DOM, leaving the predominant role to bacterial consumption. The experimental data confirmed the potential ability of bacteria to transform and/or take up the fluorescent DOM and the dissolved proteins. These results suggest that only a small part of the DOM is available for export during the winter mixing, reducing the role of the coastal Antarctic area in the CO2 sink. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Perez, MT; Sommaruga, R				Perez, Maria Teresa; Sommaruga, Ruben			Differential effect of algal- and soil-derived dissolved organic matter on alpine lake bacterial community composition and activity	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the effects of algal- and soil-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) enrichments on the activity and community composition of bacterioplankton in an alpine lake. The effects of the DOM source on bacteria were tested by establishing dilution cultures amended with either an algal lysate or with a soil extract. Cultures were incubated for 6 days under close to in situ conditions, and changes in bacterial community composition and activity were tracked by micro-autoradiography ([(3)H]-L-leucine) combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization and signal amplification by catalyzed reporter deposition. Heterotrophic bacterial production increased by 25-fold after the algal lysate addition. After 3 days, up to 90% of the bacteria were active in this treatment, and beta-Proteobacteria, particularly the subgroup R-BT, represented 86% and 67% of the total bacterial counts, respectively. From day 3 onward, the percentage of active cells in this treatment decreased dramatically as did the relative abundance of subgroup R-BT. By the end of the experiment, beta-Proteobacteria still dominated bacterial abundance (80%), but active cells were only 25% of total bacterial counts. In contrast, the addition of soil-derived DOM led only to a two- to three-fold increase in bacterial production. beta-Proteobacteria was still the dominant group (50-60% of total bacterial counts and 50% of the cells positive for leucine incorporation), but Actinobacteria made a substantial contribution (15-23%). This pattern contrasted with that observed in the treatment receiving the algal lysate, where the relative abundance of the latter group rapidly decreased. In the treatment amended with algal-derived DOM, bacterial carbon production matched the observed decrease in dissolved organic carbon concentration. However, bacterial carbon produced on soil-derived DOM accounted only for 30% of the decrease in dissolved organic carbon concentration, suggesting a more inefficient utilization of this material. The expected climate-driven changes in DOM supply to alpine lakes will affect their bacterial community structure and activity.

Red and black tides: Quantitative analysis of water-leaving radiance and perceived color for phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended sediments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Using field measurements and quantitative modeling, we demonstrate that red coloration of the sea surface is not associated with any particular group of phytoplankton and is strongly dependent on the physiology of the human visual system. Red or brown surface waters can be produced by high concentrations of most types of algae, colored dissolved organic matter, or suspended sediment. Even though light reflected by red tides commonly peaks in the yellow spectral region (570-580 nm), human color perception requires consideration of the entire spectrum of light relative to receptors within the human eye. The color shift from green to red is not due to any special optical properties of the algae but results from an overlap in spectral response of the eye's red and green cones (centered at 564 and 534 nm, respectively). The spectral peak in light reflected from dense algal blooms coincides with a critical hinge point in color vision (570-580 nm), where fine-scale shifts in the spectral shape of water-leaving radiance due to algal absorption and backscattering properties lead to pronounced variations in the observed color. Of the taxa considered, only Chlorophytes and Prochlorophytes lacked sufficient accessory pigments to produce a red tide. Chlorophyll fluorescence and enhanced near-infrared reflectance (the "red edge") contribute negligibly to the perceived color. Black water events are produced when water is highly absorbing but lacks backscattering constituents.																	0024-3590					NOV	2006	51	6					2646	2659								WOS:000242265700013		
J	Ohno, T; Bro, R				Ohno, Tsutomu; Bro, Rasmus			Dissolved organic matter characterization using multiway spectral decomposition of fluorescence landscapes	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in many soil ecosystem functions. Multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy of DOM with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of the resulting spectral landscape has been successful in characterizing DOM from a variety of aquatic sources. This study was conducted to assess the multi-way PARAFAC approach for quantitatively characterizing the fluorescent landscapes of DOM from aqueous extracts of soils and soil amendments. The DOM was extracted from plant biomass representative of crop, wetlands, and tree species; animal manures; and soils from controlled studies of cropping systems with known histories of organic amendments. The fluorescence landscape spectra were collected in the excitation range from 240 to 400 nm and emission range from 300 to 500 nm in 3-nm increments. The excitation and emission spectra modeled from the PARAFAC analysis showed that the plant biomass, animal manure, and soil DOM contained five fluorescing components: tryptophan-like (peak location at excitation 270 nm, emission 354 nm), tyrosine-like (273/309 mm), and three humic-substance-like components (> 240/465 am, 306/405 nm, and 315/447 mm). Principal component analysis of the concentration loading showed that the soil-derived DOM was very similar despite the different types and quantities of organic amendments incorporated in the different cropping systems. This study shows that PARAFAC analysis of multidimensional fluorescence spectra can model the chemical profile of terrestrial DOM in a chemically meaningful way. This represents a significant advance over current approaches to interpreting the complex DOM fluorescence spectra.

The fluorescence spectrum was normalized by the intensity of Raman scattering for reducing some negative effect induced by the intensity of excitation, the fluorescence absorption by water, and receiving conditions etc. The fluorescence spectrum normalization theory was deduced, and a nonlinear concentration calibration mathematic model based on the normalization theory was presented. The mathematic model was adopted for nonlinear least-squares data fitting to process experimental data, and a high correlation coefficient excelling 0.99 was obtained. The experimental result indicated that the nonlinear concentration calibration mathematic model based on the consideration of the fluorescence absorption by water and the effect of different concentration of DOM on the absorption was applicable to quantitative analyzing DOM in different water as a general concentration calibration mathematic model.																	1000-0593					NOV	2006	26	11					2065	2068								WOS:000242467600026

We assessed the effect of iron complexation with DOM on algal growth in the eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, using 2 species of cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii, by combining the algal growth potential (AGP) test and pretreatment of DOM decomposition by UV irradiation. We also determined which nutrient limited the growth of the 2 species in the lake water using the AGP test: iron limited the growth of the 2 species, as did nitrogen and phosphorus in Lake Kasumigaura. Moreover, the growth of the 2 species was inhibited by iron complexation with DOM. This is consistent with our results regarding iron speciation in Lake Kasumigaura by cathodic stripping voltammetry: most (> 99.9%) of the dissolved iron was present as organic species in the lake water. Furthermore, data from our AGP test suggest that iron requirement or iron availability between the 2 species are different. This difference in growth characteristics between algal species would be an important determinant of the dominance of specific algal species.				fukushima, takehiko/G-6790-2012	fukushima, takehiko/0000-0002-0095-4926												0948-3055					OCT 10	2006	44	3					231	239		10.3354/ame044231						WOS:000241745100003

Influence of dissolved organic matter on acute toxicity of zinc to larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas)	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												We conducted laboratory toxicity tests in support of the development of a biotic ligand model (BLM) to predict acute toxicity of zinc (Zn) to fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). To test the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on Zn toxicity, we exposed larval fathead minnows to Zn in water containing elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in 96-h static-renewal toxicity tests. We tested DOM isolated from four surface waters: Cypress Swamp, Delaware; Edisto River, South Carolina; Suwannee River, Georgia; and Wilmington, Delaware, wastewater treatment effluent. The DOM isolates from the Edisto River and Wilmington wastewater treatment effluent contained elevated concentrations of NaCl (20-110x control NaCl) due to the use of a Na+-exchange resin to remove Ca2+ and Mg2+ during the DOM isolation process. Therefore, we also performed Zn toxicity tests in which we added up to 20 mM NaCl to exposure solutions containing Cypress Swamp and Suwannee River DOM. A threshold concentration of 11 mg DOC/L was needed to decrease Zn toxicity, after which the 96 h Zn LC50 was positively correlated with DOC concentration. Elevated NaCl concentrations did not alter Zn toxicity in the presence of DOM. In conjunction with data from other studies with fish and invertebrates, results of this study were used to calibrate Version 2.1.1 of the Zn BLM. BLM-predicted LC50s for our exposure waters containing elevated DOM concentrations were within the range of acceptable deviation relative to the observed LC50s (i.e., 0.5-2x observed LC50s); however, BLM-predicted LC50s for our exposure waters containing < 1 mg DOC/L were 2-3x lower than the observed LC50s (i.e., the BLM over-predicted the toxicity). Therefore, the current composite-species BLM for Zn could be improved for fathead minnows if that species were modeled separately from the other species used to calibrate Version 2.1.1.																	0090-4341					OCT	2006	51	3					438	444		10.1007/s00244-005-0088-6						WOS:000240098500015	16788742

Distribution and characteristics of dissolved organic matter in mangrove sediment pore waters along the coastline of French Guiana	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Mangroves represent a major environment of tropical coasts. They are highly productive, and act both as a source and a sink of organic carbon. Concentrations and characteristics (fluorescence and hydrophobic-hydrophilic fractions) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in relation to the organic content of sediments and to the chemistry of pore waters along the coastline of French Guiana. The pore waters studied were extracted (centrifugation, soil moisture sampler) from sediments cored beneath A. germinans mangrove stands representative of development stages: pioneer, mature and senescent. In order to asses the effects of seasonal changes, two cores were performed in each location, just after dry and wet seasons, respectively. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in pore waters of the upper sediment were found to increase, from 0.7 mmol l(-1) under the pioneers to 9 under senescent mangroves. The evolution of sedimentary organic carbon (SedOC) in the same sediment paralleled that of DOC, increasing from 0.7 to 28%. On the contrary, in the lower parts of sediment cores SedOC and DOC displayed contrasting vertical trends: SedOC decreased sharply with depth while DOC increased, reaching concentrations up to 30 mmol l(-1) stop at 50 cm in the older, senescent mangroves. In addition, the Fluorescence/DOC ratios and the hydrophobic contents of DOC were higher at greater depths in most cores, expressing changes in the DOC composition. These results suggest that the DOC of the upper layers originated directly from the SedOC of the enclosing sediment, while the hydrophobic and fluorescent DOC accumulated in the anoxic bottom layer. The mechanisms responsible for this accumulation at depth requires additional research to be fully understood. However, the anoxic conditions and high pH values prevailing in the lower sediment, by lessening DOM sorption and enhancing SedOC dissolution, may be partly responsible for the high DOC concentrations and fluorescences at depth. In addition, seasonal variation may be involved. During the rainy season, water sources were mixed resulting in lower DOC concentrations in the upper sediment, whereas during the dry season, increased evapotranspiration concentrate salts and DOC, which are transported vertically with percolating water.																	0168-2563					OCT	2006	81	1					59	75		10.1007/s10533-006-9030-x						WOS:000240980500005

Chemical and biological characterization of dissolved organic matter from silver fir and beech forest soils	CHEMOSPHERE												Despite a growing attention to the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in terrestrial ecosystems and evidence of the fact that vegetation affects the quality of both undissolved and dissolved organic matter in soil, the role of DOM as a biological indicator is still poorly under stood. In this work, the fertility of 59 sites, divided into eight key alliances of the order Fagetalia sylvaticae Pawl., was studied considering chemical and biological parameters such as soil DOM, hormone-like activity, low-molecular-weight (LMW) aliphatic and phenolic acids, and floristic data. Both non-parametric tests and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed differences between silver fir and beech forests and within each type of forest. There were also differences between neutrophilous and acidophilous types. What's more, PCA reveals the dominance of the auxin (IAA)-like activity, and of some phenolic acids in distinguishing the acidophilous beeches (ACI) form the other types, whereas the gibberellin (GA)-like activity is more relevant in neutrophilous conditions such as thermophilous (THE) and mesophilous (MESO) beeches and montane (MO), high montane (HMA), high montane (HMC) silver fir forests. The GA-like activity is also related to the succinic, fumaric, malonic, and L-malic acids in the MO, HMA and HMC silver fir forests. Moreover, the role of LMW aliphatic acids in mobilizing the hormone-like activity, which improves forest growth, is stressed. The growth of seedlings of Picea abies was influenced by the phenolic acid content. At concentrations between 1 and 100 mu M, phenylacetic and protocatechuic acids inhibited root growth to the same extent as indoleacetic acid, while p-hydroxybenzoic acid had a stimulating effect comparable to that of gibberellic acid. The aliphatic and phenolic acids appear to be related to plant strategies that influence soil fertility affecting plant growth through rhizodeposition. The role of LMW aliphatic and phenolic acids as molecular markers of ecosystem function is noted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

How do temperature, dissolved organic matter and nutrients influence the response of Leptodiaptomus ashlandi to UV radiation in a subalpine lake?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is an important stressor for zooplankton in alpine lake ecosystems. Multiple environmental variables such as dissolved organic matter (DOM), temperature and nutrient availability may alter how UV affects zooplankton. 2. We conducted a week-long experiment manipulating UV, nutrients and DOM in enclosures suspended at the surface of cold and warm alpine lakes to determine the interactive effects of these variables on ovigerous Leptodiaptomus ashlandi (Marsh, 1893), a calanoid copepod. 3. UV had a negative effect on nauplii and gravid females at the colder temperature and at low, ambient DOM levels, but had no effect at the warmer temperature or when DOM was added. At the warmer temperature, fewer nauplii were produced in the +nutrient compared to -nutrient treatment. Adult survival was not affected by UV or any other experimental variable. 4. These results demonstrate that the extent of the impact of UV radiation on zooplankton in alpine systems is altered by other environmental variables, and that these effects may not be apparent from experiments that look only at the survival of adult organisms that are better defended against UV.

J	Kawahigashi, M; Kaiser, K; Rodionov, A; Guggenberger, G				Kawahigashi, Masayuki; Kaiser, Klaus; Rodionov, Andrej; Guggenberger, Georg			Sorption of dissolved organic matter by mineral soils of the Siberian forest tundra	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Because of low net production in arctic and subarctic surface water, dissolved organic matter (DOM) discharged from terrestrial settings plays an important role for carbon and nitrogen dynamics in arctic aquatic systems. Sorption, typically controlling the export of DOM from soil, may be influenced by the permafrost regime. To confirm the potential sorptive control on the release of DOM from permafrost soils in central northern Siberia, we examined the sorption of DOM by mineral soils of Gelisols and Inceptisols with varying depth of the active layer. Water-soluble organic matter in the O horizons of the Gelisols was less (338 and 407 mg C kg(-1)) and comprised more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the hydrophobic fraction (HoDOC) (63% and 70%) than in the O horizons of the Inceptisols (686 and 706 mg C kg(-1), 45% and 48% HoDOC). All A and B horizons from Gelisols sorbed DOC strongly, with a preference for HoDOC. Almost all horizons of the Inceptisols showed a weaker sorption of DOC than those of the Gelisols. The C horizons of the Inceptisols, having a weak overall DOC sorption, sorbed C in the hydrophilic fraction (HiDOC) stronger than HoDOC. The reason for the poor overall sorption and also the preferential sorption of HiDOC is likely the high pH (pH > 7.0) of the C horizons and the smaller concentrations of iron oxides. For all soils, the sorption of HoDOC related positively to oxalate- and dithionite-citrate-extractable iron. The A horizons released large amounts of DOC with 46-80% of HiDOC. The released DOC was significantly (r=0.78, P < 0.05) correlated with the contents of soil organic carbon. From these results, we assume that large concentrations of DOM comprising large shares of HiDOC can pass mineral soils where the active layer is thin (i.e. in Gelisols), and enter streams. Soils with deep active layer (i.e. Inceptisols), may release little DOM because of more frequent infiltration of DOM into their thick mineral horizons despite their smaller contents of reactive, poorly crystalline minerals. The results obtained for the Inceptisols are in agreement with the situation observed for streams connecting to Yenisei at lower latitudes than 65 degrees 50' with continuous to discontinuous permafrost. The smaller sorption of DOM by the Gelisols is in agreement with the larger DOM concentrations in more northern catchments. However, the Gelisols preferentially retained the HoDOC which dominates the DOC in streams towards north. This discrepancy can be explained by additional seepage water from the organic horizons that is discharged into streams without intensive contact with the mineral soil.

J	Boyer, JN; Dailey, SK; Gibson, PJ; Rogers, MT; Mir-Gonzalez, D				Boyer, Joseph N.; Dailey, Susan K.; Gibson, Patrick J.; Rogers, Matthew T.; Mir-Gonzalez, Danielle			The role of dissolved organic matter bioavailability in promoting phytoplankton blooms in Florida Bay	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The clear, shallow, oligotrophic waters of Florida Bay are characterized by low phytoplankton biomass, yet periodic cyanobacteria and diatom blooms do occur. We hypothesized that allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) was providing a subsidy to the system in the form of bound nutrients. Water from four bay sites was incubated under natural light and dark conditions with enrichments of either DOM (> 1 kD, 2xDOM) or inorganic nutrients (N+P). Samples were analyzed for bacterial numbers, bacterial production, phytoplankton biomass, phytoplankton community structure, and production, nutrients, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. The influence of 2xDOM enrichment on phytoplankton biomass developed slowly during the incubations and was relatively small compared to nutrient additions. Inorganic nutrient additions resulted in an ephemeral bloom characterized initially as cyanobacterial and brown algae but which changed to dinoflagellate and/or brown algae by day six. The DIN:TP ratio decreased 10-fold in the N + P treatments as the system progressed towards N limitation. This ratio did not change significantly for 2xDOM treatments. In addition, these experiments indicated that both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial populations in Florida Bay may fluctuate in their limitation by organic and inorganic nutrient availability. Both N+P and 2xDOM enrichments revealed significant and positive response in bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). Potential BDOC ranged from 1.1 to 35.5%, with the most labile forms occurring in Whipray Basin. BDOC at all sites was stimulated by the 2xDOM addition. Except for Duck Key, BDOC at all sites was also stimulated by the addition of N + P. BDOC was lower in the dry season than in the wet season (5.56% vs. 16.86%). This may be explained by the distinct chemical characteristics of the DOM produced at different times of year. Thus, both the heterotrophic and autotrophic microbial communities in Florida Bay are modulated by bioavailability of DOM. This has ramifications for the fate of DOM from the Everglades inputs, implicating DOM bioavailability as a contributing factor in regulating the onset, persistence, and composition of phytoplankton blooms.																	0018-8158					OCT	2006	569						71	85		10.1007/s10750-006-0123-2						WOS:000240576200006

Using latent effects to determine the ecological importance of dissolved organic matter to marine invertebrates	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 04-08, 2006	Orlando, FL					The uptake and utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by marine invertebrates is a field that has received significant attention over the past 100 years. Although it is well established that DOM is taken up by marine invertebrates, the extent to which it contributes to an animal's survival, growth, and reproduction (that is, the ecological benefits) remains largely unknown. Previous work seeking to demonstrate the putative ecological benefits of DOM uptake have examined them within a single life stage of an animal. Moreover, most of the benefits are demonstrated through indirect approaches by examining (1) mass balance, or (2) making comparisons of oxyenthalpic conversions of transport rates to metabolic rate as judged by oxygen consumption. We suggest that directly examining delayed metamorphosis or the latent effects associated with nutritional stress of larvae is a better model for investigating the ecological importance of DOM to marine invertebrates. We also provide direct evidence that availability of DOM enhances survival and growth of the bryozoan Bugula neritina. That DOM offsets latent effects in B. neritina suggests that the underlying mechanisms are at least in part energetic.																	1540-7063					OCT	2006	46	5					634	642		10.1093/icb/ic1025						WOS:000240620000008	21672774

Dissolved organic matter concentration and quality influences upon structure and function of freshwater microbial communities	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Past studies have suggested that the concentration and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence microbial community structure. In this study, we cross-inoculated the bacterial communities from two streams and a dystrophic lake that varied in DOM concentration and chemistry, to yield nine fully crossed treatments. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and heterotrophic microbial community productivity throughout a 72-h incubation period, characterized DOM quality by molecular weight, and determined microbial community structure at the initial and final time points. Our results indicate that all bacterial inoculate sources had similar effects upon DOC concentration and DOM quality, regardless of the DOM source. These effects included an overall decrease in DOM M (W) and an initial period of DOC concentration variability between 0-24h. In contrast, microbial communities and their metabolic rates converged to profiles that reflected the DOM source upon which they were growing, regardless of the initial bacterial inoculation. The one exception was that the bacterial community from the low-concentration and low-molecular-weight DOM source exhibited a greater denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band richness when grown in its own DOM source than when grown in the highest concentration and molecular weight DOM source. This treatment also exhibited a higher rate of productivity. In general, our data suggest that microbial communities are selected by the DOM sources to which they are exposed. A microbial community will utilize the low-molecular-weight (or labile) DOM sources as well as parts of the high-molecular-weight (refractory) DOM, until a community develops that can efficiently metabolize the more abundant high-molecular-weight source. This experiment examines some of the complex interactions between microbial community selection and the combined factors of DOM quality and concentration. Our data suggest that the roles of aerobic aquatic heterotrophic bacteria in carbon cycling, as well as the importance of high-molecular-weight DOM as a carbon source, may be more complex than is conventionally recognized.																	0095-3628					OCT	2006	52	3					378	388		10.1007/s00248-006-9089-x						WOS:000242464700002	16767520	
J	Boehme, J; Wells, M				Boehme, J; Wells, M			Fluorescence variability of marine and terrestrial colloids: Examining size fractions of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Damariscotta River estuary	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Marine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) imparts highly variable optical signatures in surface waters over short spatial and temporal scales, but the cause of that variability is poorly understood. A major fraction of dissolved organic matter in seawater is colloidal in size and can cycle quite rapidly, potentially contributing to the observed variability in CDOM. The relationship between marine colloids and CDOM optical variability was examined using flow field-flow fractionation (FIFFF) to partition the colloidal organic phase into a continuum of molecular sizes for optical characterization by excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS). Colloidal organic matter in surface seawater of the Damariscotta River estuary showed 2 major peaks in apparent abundance, spanning at similar to 1-5 kDa and similar to 15-150 kDa in size, respectively. The relative magnitude of these peaks changed systematically with the phase of phytoplankton blooms during 2003 and 2004, implying a relationship between colloid size distribution and bloom dynamics. Of the two colloidal sizes, the 1-5 kDa fraction was far more variable in apparent abundance than the larger colloidal matter. EEMS results reveal a compositional partitioning of protein-like and humic-like fluorescence between size fractions. Protein-like materials occurred primarily in the smallest colloid size fraction while humic-type materials resided mainly in the larger colloidal phase. These findings suggest that the fluorescence signature of bulk dissolved organic matter results from a collage of chromophores having optical characteristics that differ according to size of the molecular constituents. The colloidal-sized fluorescence characteristics of marine derived CDOM were contrasted with bulk CDOM to provide fundamental information on the distribution and forms of CDOM in Maine coastal waters. The findings here indicate that colloidal processes will have significant effects on the character and variability in the optical signature of surface seawaters. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The DOM was isolated during spring and fall seasons using a reverse osmosis technique. The DOM samples were analyzed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, solid-state CP-MAS C-13-NMR, and C-1s NEXAFS spectroscopy. In addition, the relative abundance of carbon isotopes (C-12, C-13, C-14) in the samples was measured. There were no significant differences in the chemical composition or carbon isotope signature of the DOM sampled in spring and fall seasons. Also, differences in DOM composition between the five catchments were minor. Compared to reference peat fulvic and humic acids, all DOM samples were richer in O-alkyl carbon and contained less aromatic and phenolic carbon, as shown by FT-IR, C-13-NMR, and C-1s NEXAFS spectroscopy. The DOM was clearly enriched in(14)C relative to the NBS oxalic acid standard of 1950, indicating that the aquatic DOM contained considerable amounts of organic carbon younger than about 50 years. The weight-based C:N ratios of 31 +/- 6 and the delta C-13 values of -29 +/- 2 parts per thousand indicate that the isolated DOM is of terrestrial rather than aquatic origin. We conclude that young, hydrophilic carbon compounds of terrestrial origin are predominant in the samples investigated, and that the composition of the aquatic DOM in the studied boreal forest catchments is rather stable during low to intermediate flow conditions.

Beneficial and detrimental interactive effects of dissolved organic matter and ultraviolet radiation on zooplankton in a transparent lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												While changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations are expected to affect zooplankton species through attenuation of potentially damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation, generation of potentially beneficial or harmful photoproducts, pH alteration, and microbial food web stimulation, the combined effects of such changes on zooplankton community structure have not been studied previously. Our purpose was to determine how an increase in allochthonous DOM and associated changes in pH in an initially transparent lake may affect zooplankton community structure, and how exposure to solar UV may alter these DOM and pH effects. We ran microcosm experiments manipulating UV, DOM, and pH near the surface of Lake Giles in northeastern Pennsylvania. We found that when DOM was added in the presence of ambient UV, Daphnia and copepod UV-mortality was reduced by approximately three and two times compared to UV exposure without extra DOM. When DOM was added in the absence of UV, adult Daphnia and copepods were reduced compared to no DOM addition in the absence of UV. Daphnia and cyclopoid egg production and rotifer abundance were generally higher in the presence of DOM, regardless of UV treatment. The lower abundance yet high egg production in the presence of DOM and absence of UV may be explained by higher abundance of egg-bearing adults compared to non-egg-bearers. We conclude that allochthonous DOM benefits some zooplankton in a high-UV environment, but may be detrimental under low-UV conditions. Overall, Daphnia abundance and egg production were higher than that of calanoid copepods in the DOM additions, indicating that in some lakes an increase in allochthonous DOM may lead to a zooplankton community shift favoring Daphnia over calanoid copepods.

Influence of chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on lake reflectance spectra: Implications for measuring lake properties by remote sensing	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Light reflected from lake surfaces can convey much information about water quality, especially algal abundance, humic content, turbidity and suspended solids. Light reflectance from lakes is complicated, and detailed spectra are needed for analysis of controlling factors. We obtained detailed reflectance spectra from the water surfaces of 15 lakes in east-central Minnesota and found patterns related to chlorophyll a (ch1 a), turbidity and humic matter (colored dissolved organic matter, CDOM). Increasing ch1 a and turbidity generally resulted in higher reflectance across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Increasing CDOM led to low reflectance, especially below similar to 500 nm. Spectra of lakes with high ch1 a were distinguishable from those of lakes low in ch1 a, and lakes with low or high CDOM had readily distinguishable spectra. Several optical characteristics of lake water can be estimated from reflectance intensities measured over narrow wavelength bands. The ratio of reflectance at 700 nm to that at 670 nm was the best predictor of ch1 a over a wide range of conditions, including high turbidity and CDOM. Several relationships involving reflectance at 412, 443, 488, and 551 nm, the wavelengths used to calculate oceanic ch1 a from MODIS satellite data, also yielded a high R-2. The ratio of reflectance at 670 nm to 571 nm provided the best estimates of humic color despite the low absorbance of CDOM at these wavelengths. Relationships involving reflectance for all 15 lakes in the range 400-500 nm, where CDOM absorbs light, had low r(2) values; none was high enough for reliable estimates of lake color. For 10 lakes with low to medium ch1 a levels (<= 10 mg m(-3)), regressions involving 412 and 443 nm yielded moderately good relationships. Airborne and satellite remote sensing thus might be used to identify lakes high in CDOM, and may provide reasonable estimates of humic color in lakes with low ch1 a levels.																	1040-2381					SEP	2006	22	3					179	190								WOS:000243027700001		
J	Kawasaki, N; Benner, R				Kawasaki, Nobu; Benner, Ronald			Bacterial release of dissolved organic matter during cell growth and decline: Molecular origin and composition	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Heterotrophic bacterial growth and the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced by bacteria from freshwater and marine environments were monitored during experiments with artificial media containing glucose as the sole carbon source. Glucose was quickly consumed, and DOM was released during bacterial growth. Percentages of extracellular release of DOM from bacteria ranged from 14% to 31%, indicating that bacterial production and growth efficiency are underestimated when only cellular carbon is measured. Relatively high concentrations of D-alanine (D-Ala) were observed in DOM released during exponential growth, whereas the concentrations of muramic acid and other D-amino acid components of peptidoglycan were not detected or were in low concentration. The selective release of D-Ala occurred during cell growth and division when peptidoglycan is cleaved and newly synthesized subunits are incorporated into the cell wall via transpeptidation. Most of the D-Ala released during exponential growth was rapidly consumed. Following exponential growth, bacterial abundance decreased due to grazing and possibly viral lysis. The DOM remaining in the incubations after one or more months included a mixture of D-amino acids commonly found in peptidoglycan and the amino sugars glucosamine and galactosamine, which were highly resistant to decomposition. The percentage of D-amino acids was much higher in DOM than in cells due to the preferential release of D-amino acids and decomposition of L-amino acids. The final concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 20 to 30 mu mol L-1 regardless of the initial concentration of glucose or the source of inoculum. The observed abundances of D-amino acids and amino sugars in DOM from diverse aquatic environments indicate a bacterial source and common decomposition processes.

EfRects of salinity changes on the photodegradation and ultraviolet-visible absorbance of terrestrial dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We performed laboratory studies to determine the effects of salinity on the photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the Great Dismal Swamp, Virginia, an important source of terrestrial DOM to the lower Chesapeake Bay. Samples were created by mixing Great Dismal Swamp water (ionic strength approximate to 0 mol L-1) with modified artificial seawater solutions of differing salinities while keeping the final dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration constant. These samples were then irradiated for 24 h in a light box providing ultraviolet (UV) light similar to that of natural sunlight. Light absorbance and DOC concentrations decreased after photoexposure, whereas dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations increased. Variations in salinity affected both DIC production and UV absorption, with the higher salinity samples showing lower DIC production and less photobleaching. Addition of an iron chelator eliminated the relationship between photochemistry and salinity by reducing both photobleaching and DIC production at low salinities. As terrigenous DOM transits through an estuary, its photochemical reactivity and optical properties may change significantly as a function of salinity, probably as a result of changes in DOM conformation or changes in iron-DOM photochemistry, or both.																	0024-3590					SEP	2006	51	5					2181	2186								WOS:000240673800022

Cadmium accumulation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) eggs is modulated by dissolved organic matter (DOM)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Experiments were conducted to investigate factors influencing the accumulation of cadmium (Cd2+) into zebrafish (Danio rerio) eggs. The accumulation of Cd-109 was affected by: (1) concentration, (2) time, (3) presence of dissolved organic material (DOM), (4) different origin of DOM and (5) different parts of fish eggs. Over a 5-h exposure, zebrafish eggs showed a steady increase in Cd-accumulation. DOM-concentrations over 15 ppm carbon (C) decreased Cd-uptake significantly. Both samples of DOM, brown water marsh (LM) and a eutrophic pond (SP), at 16.9 ppm C, reduced the Cd-accumulation in the chorion, perivitelline liquid and the embryo. Cd was mainly accumulated in the egg's outer shell chorion (61%) and only small amounts passed through the chorion into the perivitelline liquid (38%) and embryo (1%). In the presence of LM-DOM, the accumulation of Cd into the egg components was decreased by 43% (chorion), 52% (perivitelline liquid) and 52% (embryo), respectively, compared with the control group. Similarly, the presence of SP-DOM reduced the Cd-accumulation by 29% (chorion), 61% (perivitelline liquid) and 60% (embryo), respectively, compared with the controls. DOM-concentration should be taken into consideration when determining ecotoxicological effects of Cd on fish populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xu, YD; Yue, DB; Zhu, Y; Nie, YF				Xu, Yu-Dong; Yue, Dong-Bei; Zhu, Yi; Nie, Yong-Feng			Fractionation of dissolved organic matter in mature landfill leachate and its recycling by ultrafiltration and evaporation combined processes	CHEMOSPHERE												XAD resin procedure was used to isolate dissolved organic matter (DOM) of a mature leachate collected from a municipal solid waste landfill in Beijing, China. The fulvic acids fraction dominated in collected leachate, accounting for 64% of DOM as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and a high concentration of humic substances (HS) with a value of 441 mg l(-1) was found in the leachate. Molecular size distribution of DOM was also done by using batch ultrafiltration (UF) technique. Two major parts of the molecules of DOM were distributed in the regions of smaller than 1 kDa and 1-3.5 kDa, containing 45% and 43% of DOM as DOC, respectively. The laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to investigate and to develop an overall concept for mature leachate recycling based on UF and evaporation combined processes. Separation factor (SF) was applied to evaluate separation efficiency of UF. The data indicate that SF is strongly correlated with concentration factor. Second retentate from two-stage UF contained relatively high amount of DOM comprising 91% of HS and an insignificant concentration of heavy metals. The SF value for two-stage UF was more than 10. These results demonstrate that two-stage UF could effectively separate and refine HS in mature leachate from inorganic components. For achieving the main requirements as a fertilizer product, second retentate was further concentrated by evaporation, and contents of organic matter and dry-solids were obtained 13 wt.% and 25 wt.%, respectively. This study confirmed the feasibility of recycling HS from mature leachate. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was focused on DOM characteristics of importance for its interaction with pollutants, such as molecular weight distribution and aromaticity. It was concluded that the leachate DOM underwent substantial qualitative changes along the investigated gradient at the Vejen landfill, Denmark. The molecular weight decreased, the polydispersity increased, and the aromaticity varied with the lowest values found in the middle of the gradient. The high aromaticity in the end of the gradient may explain the higher DOM binding capacity towards hydrophobic compounds seen earlier in these samples. The relative abundance of ions with mass to charge ratio (m/z) of 600-1200 seemed to be very stable along the gradient, indicating that the observed qualitative changes of the DOM is mostly attributed to changes in the m/z 100-600 range. The DOM seemed to become more similar to fulvic acids present in uncontaminated groundwater with respect to molecular weight and polydispersity along the gradient. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lou, T; Xie, HX; Chen, GH; Gagne, JP				Lou, Tao; Xie, Huixiang; Chen, Guohua; Gagne, Jean-Pierre			Effects of photodegradation of dissolved organic matter on the binding of benzo(a)pyrene	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural waters can bind various organic pollutants, and the affinity of this binding is strongly influenced by the chemical characteristics of the DOM and water pH. This study examined the effects of photochemically induced alteration of the DOM's chemical properties and water pH on the binding of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Time- and pH-series of solar-simulated irradiations were performed on a natural water sample and aqueous DOM solutions prepared from aquatic and soil humic substances. The binding affinity of BaP, expressed as a partition coefficient of a compound to DOM, decreased substantially after the DOM samples were irradiated over environmentally relevant radiation doses and pH ranges. The lowering of the pH due to the photoproduction of acidic products often partly offsets the reduction of the binding affinity caused by direct photoalteration of the DOM's chemical structure. The decrease of the binding affinity, after correction for the photoinduced pH change, was positively correlated with the decrease in the molecular weight and the aromaticity of the DOM in the course of irradiation. Increasing O-2 abundance accelerated the decrease of the binding affinity as a result of enhanced DOM photodegradation. Visible light played a more important role in reducing the molecular weight and aromaticity of the DOM than in reducing the content of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via photoremineralization while the reverse was true for UV radiation, indicating that photochemical reduction of the binding affinity may occur in natural waters at depths greater than UV radiation can reach. A decrease of the affinity of DOM for binding BaP will increase the free dissolved fraction of BaP and thus its availability and toxicity to aquatic organisms. The results from this study may have similar implications for organic pollutants other than BaP. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation in dissolved organic matter controls bacterial production and community composition	ECOLOGY												An ongoing debate in ecology revolves around how species composition and ecosystem function are related. To address the mechanistic controls of this relationship, we manipulated the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fed to aquatic bacteria to determine effects on both bacterial activity and community composition. Sites along terrestrial to aquatic flow paths were chosen to simulate movement of DOM through catchments, and DOM was fed to downslope and control bacterial communities. Bacterial production was measured, and DOM chemistry and bacterial community composition ( using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes) were characterized following incubations. Bacterial production, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-specific bacterial production, and DOC consumption were greatest in mesocosms fed soil water DOM; soil water DOM enhanced lake and stream bacterial production by 320-670% relative to lake and stream controls. Stream DOM added to lake bacteria depressed bacterial production relative to lake controls in the early season (-78%) but not the mid-season experiment. Addition of upslope DOM to stream and lake bacterial communities resulted in significant changes in bacterial community composition relative to controls. In four of five DOM treatments, the bacterial community composition converged to the DOM source community regardless of the initial inoculum. These results demonstrate that shifts in the supply of natural DOM were followed by changes in both bacterial production and community composition, suggesting that changes in function are likely predicated on at least an initial change in the community composition. The results indicate that variation in DOM composition of soil and surface waters influences bacterial community dynamics and controls rates of carbon processing in set patterns across the landscape.

Two different types of DOM were used, that is to say, dissolved natural organic matter extracts from a commercial peat (DNOM) and a high-purity tannic acid (TA) solution. The experiments were carried out in a 0.01 M CaCl2 aqueous medium at 25 degrees C. The results indicated that the presence of both DNOM and TA, over a concentration range of 15-100 mg L-1, produced an increase in the amount of 3,4-DCA and 4-BA sorbed and a decrease in the amount of imidacloprid retained on the soil studied. A modified distribution coefficient, K-doc, has been proposed as a safer parameter for soil sorption predictions of organic pollutants and it could be of help to model the fate of these in the environment.

Lignin degradation controls the production of dissolved organic matter in decomposing foliar litter	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Lignin is considered to be a crucial component controlling litter decomposition but its role in the production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from litter is not well understood. Our main objective therefore was to examine the amounts and properties of DOM produced in decomposing litter, with special emphasis on the role of lignin degradation. We exposed litter of five different tree species (Sycamore maple, Mountain ash, European beech, Norway spruce, Scots pine) in litterbags at the soil surface of two neighbouring sites to degradation under field conditions. Litterbags were sampled eight times during 27 months of exposure in the field. We determined mass loss and characterized the lignin fraction by two different methods (van Soest procedure, acid-detergent lignin: ADL, CuO oxidation). Litter was irrigated in the laboratory and leachates were analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and characterized by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. Litter decomposition followed a two-stage model characterized by initially rapid and then decreasing degradation with time. In the initial phase of litter decomposition, leached amounts of DOM decreased with time and no effects of lignin degradation were found. The contents of ADL in the litter residues and CuO oxidation products suggest larger degradation and oxidation of lignin in beech, spruce and pine litter than in maple and ash litter. The production of DOM from litter with larger lignin degradation increased in the second phase of decomposition, when mass loss exceeded 10-20%. In contrast, DOM produced from litter showing weak lignin degradation (maple, ash) did not increase further in the second phase of decomposition. In the leachates of litter with large lignin degradation (beech, spruce, pine), UV absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy indicated a larger increase in the contribution of lignin-derived compounds to DOM with increasing mass loss than for litter species with relatively stable lignin. We conclude that degradation of lignin is an important control on DOM production during the second phase of litter decomposition.

The influence of forestry activity on the structure of dissolved organic matter in lakes: Implications for mercury photoreactions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												It is well known that dissolved organic matter (DOM) increases in lakes associated with forestry activity but characterization of the DOM structure is incomplete. Twenty-three lakes with a wide range of forestry activities located in central Quebec, Canada were sampled and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, DOC fluorescence, and ultra violet-visible (UV-VIS) absorption spectra. The results show that DOC increases (as does the associated DOC fluorescence) with increased logging (slope=0.122, r(2)=0.581, p < 0.001; and slope=0.283, r(2)=0.308, p < 0.01, respectively) in the 23 lakes sampled however, the aromaticity of the DOM does not change with changes in logging (as found by UV-VIS ratios, absorbance slope in the UV region, and DOC normalized fluorescence (slope=1.42 x 10(-2) r(2)=0.331, p < 0.01). The DOM from four of these lakes was concentrated using reverse osmosis (RO) followed by freeze-drying. The structures of the concentrated dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples were analyzed using X-ray analysis of near edge structures (XANES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) analysis. XANES analysis of functional groups in the four concentrated samples shows that there are significant differences in reduced sulphur between the samples, however there was no clear relationship with forestry activity in the associated catchment. XRD data showed the presence of amorphous sulphide minerals associated with the DOM concentrate that may be important sites for mercury binding. The C-13 NMR spectra of these samples show that the percentage of carbon present in carboxylic functional groups increases with increasing logging. Such structures are important for binding photo-reducible mercury and their presence may limit mercury photo-reduction and volatilization. We propose a mechanism by which increased logging leads to increased carboxylic groups in DOM and thereby increased weak binding of photo-reducible mercury. These results, in part, explain the decrease in dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) production rates with increased logging found in our previous work. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Photo-oxidation of dissolved organic matter in river water and its effect on trace element speciation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To investigate the effect of photodegradation of fluvial dissolved organic matter (DOM) on dissolved trace element distributions, we performed a 3-week incubation of water from the lower Pearl River (Mississippi). The experiment was performed in natural light (with dark controls) and examined both the changes in DOM and changes in physical-chemical speciation of a suite of trace metals. During the incubation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased in the light by about 20%, whereas ultraviolet light absorbance decreased by nearly 40%; dark controls showed no significant change in DOC. For the trace elements, a variety of behaviors were observed. Some elements (alkali and alkaline earth metals, Mo, Mn, Cd, and Zn) showed no change in concentration or speciation. A number of elements, however, did show significant changes in the light. For example, there was a significant, continuous decrease in dissolved (< 0.02-mu m) Fe in the light samples during the experiment. This and other speciation results indicate that organically complexed Fe was released during photo-oxidation of the low-molecular-weight DOM; this was followed by subsequent precipitation of the released Fe as additional colloidal FcOOH. Other elements (Ce, Cu, Cr, Pb, V, and U) also showed decreases in the dissolved (< 0.02-mu m) fraction with time. Some of these elements, as well as Co and Ni, also showed decreases in their retention by an anion exchange column, likewise implying a decrease in their organically complexed forms.																	0024-3590					JUL	2006	51	4					1716	1728								WOS:000239262200016		
J	Zhao, ZY; Gu, JD; Fan, XJ; Li, HB				Zhao, ZY; Gu, JD; Fan, XJ; Li, HB			Molecular size distribution of dissolved organic matter in water of the Pearl River and trihalomethane formation characteristics with chlorine and chlorine dioxide treatments	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												River water sample was collected from Guangzhou section of the Pearl River to investigate soluble organic fractions and formation of trihalomethane (THMs) after chlorine and chlorine dioxide treatments. The water sample was passed through Amicon((R)) YC-05, YM-1, YM-3, YM-10, YM-30, YM-100 and ZM-500 series membranes after a pre-treatment. The molecular weight distribution and the specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA(254)) of each fraction obtained from membrane were analyzed, and these fractions were further disinfected with chlorine and chlorine dioxide. The results showed that reverse osmosis (RO) fraction contained mainly dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the water sample, suggesting that the water has been highly contaminated by anthropogenic activities. Meanwhile, the THMs concentration and SUVA254 increased gradually as the molecular weight of the obtained fractions reduced, indicating that the low molecular weight DOM was the major THMs precursor in the disinfection process with chlorine and chlorine dioxide. The results suggest that THMs in source water of Pearl River could be effectively reduced when pollution of human activity is greatly controlled. Between the two disinfection processes tested, chlorine dioxide produced less THMs than chlorine in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hefner, KH; Fisher, JM; Ferry, JL				Hefner, KH; Fisher, JM; Ferry, JL			A multifactor exploration of the photobleaching of suwannee river dissolved organic matter across the freshwatersaltwater interface	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A four factor central composite experimental design was applied to explore the photobleaching of Suwannee River dissolved organic matter (SRDOM) at 350 nm as a function of the tetravariate system of [SRDOM], total [Fe(III)], [NO3-], and salinity. The ranges of each factor were set to cover their likely concentrations at the freshwater/saltwater interface, to encompass the possible conditions encountered during the transition from the terrestrial to marine environment. Each experiment was carried out using a minimum of 25 different initial conditions, with 3-6 replicates/condition. The resulting data set mapped out the effects of multiple photoactive components on the rate of photobleaching. Under the conditions tested (nominally total [Fe(III)] 0.00-4.00 mu M; [NO3-] 0.00-60.00 mu M; SRDOM 0.00-30.00 mg/L; salinity 0.00-35.00 ppt, polychromatic illumination, pH 8.2) all samples photobleached at all wavelengths measured, and the absorption at 350 nm bleached the most rapidly. The most important factor for predicting the rate of photobleaching at 350 nm was the initial loading of SRDOM; the effect of all other factors on photobleaching was not significant at the 95% level of confidence. Varied salinity, Fe(III), or added D2O had no effect on the rate of photobleaching, indicating that hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, and superoxide did not contribute significantly to the loss of the chromophore at 350 nm. The addition of hydroquinone or thiosulfate inhibited photobleaching, suggesting photobleaching may depend on a weaker oxidant such as the excited-state acceptors (derived from SRDOM directly) produced during photoinitiated charge-transfer processes. The advantages of multifactor experimental techniques for exploring SRDOM photochemistry are discussed.

CRAM are distributed throughout the water column and are the most abundant components of deep ocean DOM ever characterized. CRAM are comprised of a complex mixture of carboxylated and fused alicyclic structures with a carboxyl-C:aliphatic-C ratio of 1:2 to 1:7. CRAM are expected to constitute a strong ligand for metal binding, and multiple coordination across cations could promote aggregation and marine gel formation thereby affecting CRAM reactivity and the bioavailability of nutrients and trace metals. It appears CRAM arc ultimately derived from biomolecules with structural similarities to sterols and hopanoids. The occurrence of CRAM in freshwater and terrestrial environments seems likely, considering the global distribution of biomolecules and the similarities of biogeochernical processes among environments.

In 36-day time series experiments, bacteria were grown on glucose both with and without protozoa. We measured bulk organic carbon pools and used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to characterize dissolved organic matter on a molecular level. Bacteria rapidly utilized glucose, depleting it to nondetectable levels and producing new DOC compounds of higher molecular weight within 2 days. Some of these new compounds, representing 3 to 5% of the initial glucose-C, were refractory and persisted for over a month. Other new compounds were produced and subsequently used by bacteria during the lag and exponential growth phases, pointing to a dynamic cycling of organic compounds. Grazers caused a temporary spike in the DOC concentration consisting of labile compounds subsequently utilized by the bacteria. Grazing did not increase the complexity of the DOC pool already established by the bacteria but did continually decrease the particulate organic carbon pool and expedited the conversion of glucose-C to CO, After 36 days, 29% of initial glucose-C remained in pure bacteria cultures, while only 60% remained in cultures where a grazer was present. In this study the bacteria were the primary shapers of the complex DOC continuum, suggesting higher trophic levels possibly have less of an impact on the qualitative composition of DOC than previously assumed.

Batch sorption isotherm techniques were used to evaluate the important physiochemical properties of soil determining the sorption of atrazine in the presence of DOM. The sorption of atrazine as a representative of nonionic organic contaminants ( NOCs) by soil with and without DOM could be well described by the Linear and Freundlich models. The n values of the Freundlich model were generally near to 1, indicating that linear partitioning was the major mechanism of atrazine sorption by soil samples. The apparent distribution coefficient, K-d(*) value, for atrazine sorption in the presence of DOM initially increased and decreased thereafter as the DOM concentration increased in the equilibrium solution. DOM at relatively lower concentrations significantly enhanced the sorption of atrazine by soil, while it inhibited the atrazine sorption at higher concentrations. For all the soil samples, the maximum of K-d(*) was 1.1 similar to 3.1 times higher than its corresponding K-d value for the control ( without DOM). The maximum enhancement of the distribution coefficient (Delta k(d)(*)) in the presence of DOM was negatively correlated with the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) and positively correlated with the clay content. The critical concentration of DOM, below which DOM would enhance atrazine sorption, was negatively correlated with SOC. The influence of DOM on atrazine sorption could be approximately considered as the net effect of the cumulative sorption and association of atrazine with DOM in solution. Results of this study provide an insight into the retention and mobility of a NOC in the soil environment.

Influence of dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients on the biofilm bacterial community on artificial substrates in a northeastern Ohio, USA, stream	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Stream bacteria may be influenced by the composition and availability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and inorganic nutrients, but knowledge about how individual phylogenetic groups in biofilm are affected is still limited. In this study, the influence of DOM and inorganic nutrients on stream biofilm bacteria was examined. Biofilms were developed on artificial substrates (unglazed ceramic tiles) for 21 days in a northeastern Ohio (USA) stream for five consecutive seasons. Then, the developed biofilm assemblages were exposed, in the laboratory, to DOM (glucose, leaf leachate, and algal exudates) and inorganic nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, and nitrate and phosphate in combination) amendments for 6 days. Bacterial numbers in the biofilms were generally higher in response to the DOM treatments than to the inorganic nutrient treatments. There were also apparent seasonal variations in the response patterns of the individual bacterial taxa to the nutrient treatments; an indication that limiting resources to bacteria in stream biofilms may change over time. Overall, in contrast to the other treatments, bacterial abundance was generally highest in response to the low-molecular-weight DOM (i.e., glucose) treatment. These results further suggest that there are interactions among the different bacterial groups in biofilms that are impacted by the associated nutrient dynamics among seasons in stream ecosystems.																	0008-4166					JUN	2006	52	6					540	549		10.1139/W06-003						WOS:000238923400006	16788722

Spectroscopic and thermal investigation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of dissolved organic matter	COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION												Hydrophobic (HO) and hydrophilic (HI) fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from several substrates including a source separated urban waste compost, a mechanically separated urban waste compost, an anaerobically digested municipal sewage sludge, a composted sewage sludge and a cow slurry were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), monodimensional fluorescence spectroscopy in the emission, excitation and synchronous scan modes, tridimensional excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, H nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The FT-IR spectra indicated that the HI fractions were rich in both aromatic and aliphatic structures, whereas the HO fractions were rich in carboxylic groups and polysaccharides. The synchronous scan spectra of HO fractions showed the main peak at a wavelength much longer than that of the HI fractions, which indicated a greater molecular complexity of the HO fractions with respect to HI fractions. The H-1-NMR data indicated a great percentage of aliphatic structures in all samples, whereas the HO samples were also characterised by the presence of aromatic structures. The DSC curves confirmed the more distinct aromatic nature of HO fractions, as compared to the corresponding HI fractions.																	1065-657X					SUM	2006	14	3					191	200								WOS:000240666900005

Seasonal patterns in the concentrations of DOM in the freshwater supply to the estuary differed depending on the soil and drainage characteristics of the area. In streams draining more natural areas the patterns observed were largely driven by seasonal temperature fluctuations. The material exported from agricultural areas was more variable and largely controlled by precipitation events. Positive exponential relationships were found between the nitrogen and phosphorus loading, and the percentage of catchment area used for agriculture. Colored DOM (CDOM) loading measurements were found to be a good predictor of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loading across the different subcatchments, offering a rapid and inexpensive alternative of operationally monitoring DOC export. For all the dissolved nutrient inputs to the estuary, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved organic phosphorus dominated the loadings. Although 81% of the nitrogen annually supplied to the estuary was DIN, 83% of the nitrogen exported from the estuary was dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Results show that increasing the area of the catchment covered by forest and natural pastures would have a positive effect on the trophic status of the estuary, leading to a considerable decrease in the phosphorus loading and a shift in the nitrogen loading from DIN to DON. Such a change in land use would also increase the export of DOC and CDOM to the estuary having the potential to increase oxygen consumption and reduce the phofic depth.

J	Wang, XC; Callahan, J; Chen, RF				Wang, XC; Callahan, J; Chen, RF			Variability in radiocarbon ages of biochemical compound classes of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter in estuaries	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												High molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM, > 1000 Da) represents a major fraction (> 30%) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ocean and thus plays an important role in the global biogeochemical cycling of carbon and many other elements. Its organic sources and formation mechanisms, however, are still not well understood especially in estuarine and coastal regions where multiple natural and anthropogenic sources contribute to total HMW-DOM. In this paper we report our measurements of natural radiocarbon (C-14) abundances and stable carbon isotope (C-13) compositions of the major biochemical compound classes: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids separated from eight HMW-DOM samples collected from five US estuaries as part of our on-going study of sources, distribution and transport of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in estuarine and coastal waters. Distinct differences in both C-14 and C-13 values were found among the bulk HMW-DOM samples as well as the individual compound classes. Radiocarbon ages of the major compound classes varied by as much as 27,000 years in a single sample. The calculated average radiocarbon ages of the compound fractions of HMW-DOM indicate that the total lipid fraction is very "old", while the acid-insoluble fraction is slightly younger. Total amino acid and carbohydrate fractions, however, have relatively modern apparent C-14 ages. The significant variability in C-14 ages among the compound classes indicates not only multiple organic carbon sources but also different formation and turnover pathways controlling the cycling of different biochemical components of HMW-DOM in estuarine and coastal waters.

We examined the relationship between the source of organic matter and the structure and function of lake bacterial communities. Differences and seasonal changes in bacterial community composition in two lakes differing in their source of organic matter were followed in relation to environmental variables. We also performed batch culture experiments with amendments of various organic substrates, namely fulvic acids, leachates from algae, and birch and maple leaves. Differences in bacterial community composition between the lakes, analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, correlated with variables related to the relative loading of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (water colour, dissolved organic carbon, nutrients, and pH). Seasonal changes correlated with temperature, chlorophyll and dissolved organic carbon in both lakes. The substrate amendments led to differences in both structure and function, i.e. production, respiration and growth yield, of the bacterial community. In conclusion, our results suggest that the source of organic matter influences community composition both within and among lakes and that there may be a coupling between the structure and function of the bacterial community.

The temperature was altered within the range of 20 to 75 degrees C, and the intensity of DOM fluorescence and water Raman scattering were found to decrease with rising temperature. A linear fit of the normalized fluorescence intensity versus temperature yielded a mean value of the temperature coefficient of -5. 2 4 X 10(-4) (.) degrees C-1, and a mean value of the temperature coefficient of -3.42 X 10(-3)(mg (.) L-1) (.) degrees C-1 was obtained according to the relationship between normalized fluorescence intensity and concentration of DOM. The temperature change will cause relative changes of up to 8.45% in DOM concentration within the range of 20 to 75 degrees C if we assume that the normalized fluorescence intensity remains the same.

J	Yang, WC; Spurlock, F; Liu, WP; Gan, JY				Yang, WC; Spurlock, F; Liu, WP; Gan, JY			Effects of dissolved organic matter on permethrin bioavailability to Daphnia species	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Synthetic pyrethroids are widely used insecticides in both agricultural and urban environments. Recent studies show frequent appearances of pyrethroid residues in runoff effluents and sediments, which stimulated concerns over the potential ecotoxicological implications. Pyrethroids are known to have two contrasting characteristics, high aquatic toxicity and strong affinity for the solid phase, that may negate the actual toxicity in a multiphased system. This study evaluated the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the pyrethroid uptake by and acute toxicity to water-column invertebrates using permethrin as a model compound. During the bioassays, the freely dissolved permethrin concentration was simultaneously measured using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) fibers as a biomimetic surrogate. The presence of DOM consistently decreased permethrin uptake and increased its LC50. For instance, compared to the DOM-free treatment, the LC50 of permethrin to Ceriodaphnia dubia in a pond water containing DOM at 10 mg L-1 increased from 0.56 to 1.03 Ag L-1, whereas the bioaccumulation factor by Daphnia magna decreased by 56%. Permethrin accumulation on the PDMS fiber closely mimicked permethrin uptake by D. magna. Statistical analyses suggest that permethrin associated with DOM was completely unavailable to D. magna or C. dubia. The effect of DOM on permethrin bioavailability appeared to depend also on the source of the DOM. These results indicate that the inhibitory role of DOM should be considered in the development of toxicologically relevant water quality limits and in monitoring protocols for permethrin and other pyrethroids in runoff effluents and surface streams that ubiquitously contain DOM.				gao, xiuyun/B-1715-2010; Liu, Weiping/E-9208-2010	Liu, Weiping/0000-0002-1173-892X												0021-8561					MAY 31	2006	54	11					3967	3972		10.1021/jf060217y						WOS:000237832100030	16719522

Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is a subset of the larger CDOM pool that can be used to look at sources of CDOM. Experiments were conducted with copepods and the pelagic larvacean, Oikopleura dioica to determine if these two types of zooplankton excrete FDOM. Shipboard bottle experiments were conducted with copepods in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Mississippi River Plume in April 2001 and laboratory experiments with the pelagic larvacean, O. dioica were conducted in Oviedo, Spain in June 2001. Both copepods and O. dioica were found to excrete FDOM. Excitation/emission matrices revealed that both animals contributed to fluorescent protein pools (ex/em 275/315-350 nm) and to humic-like material (maximum ex/em 300/420 nm). The humic-like material excreted by the copepods and larvaceans was shifted toward shorter wavelengths, providing a possible unique fluorescent signature for zooplankton. Using a ratio of the humic-like fluorescence excreted by the animals (ex/em 300/420) to the humic-like fluorescence maximum in controls (ex/em 320/420 run) showed the zooplankton could contribute nearly 50% of the Peak M fluorescence. Molecular weight analysis of the CDOM in an O. dioica excretion study showed that O. dioica excreted CDOM was primarily < 30 kDa. Both copepods and larvaceans are sources of marine FDOM and CDOM and can potentially influence the amount and type of CDOM present in coastal waters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A case of study: Katonga and Bunjako Bays (Victoria Lake; Uganda)	CHEMOSPHERE												Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) is an important component in freshwater and marine ecosystems and plays direct and indirect role in biogeochemical cycles. CDOM originates from the degradation process of organic materials, usually macrophytes and planktons. The present work examines the importance of wetland derived CDOM on the optical and bio-optical properties of two bays of Lake Victoria (Uganda, Africa). This was achieved by determining the attenuation and extinction coefficients of filtered and unfiltered water samples from two equatorial bays on the Ugandan coastline of Lake Victoria. Katonga Bay is a wetland lined bay that receives water from the Katonga river, while Bunjako Bay is an outer bay between Katonga Bay and Lake Victoria. The results showed that attenuation was highest in Katonga Bay and the role of CDOM is most dominant near the river inlet. The quantity and quality of CDOM is extremely different in the two bays: in Katonga Bay it is possible to hypothesize a terrestrial origin of CDOM (transported by the wetland river). On the contrary, in Bunjako Bay, spectral measurements of absorption indicate a modified CDOM and/ or alternative CDOM source. The terrestrial CDOM in Katonga Bay is more capable of absorbing harmful UV radiation than the CDOM present in the Bunjako Bay. The resulting optical environment in the former bay presented a water column with a very limited penetration of harmful UV radiation, while a higher penetration was observed in the Bunjako Bay.

Injection of KCl (0.1 M) resulted in a high release of Co-60 (60-100%) and Sr-85 (72-100%) but a smaller release Of Cs-134 (31-66%). Only limited release of Co-60 (66%) and Sr-81 (71%) and no release Of Cs-134 were observed by injection of NOM. The different percentages of desorption were related to the chemical characteristics of the organic colloids previously retained in columns before the desorption step. The results evidenced different sorption processes on energetically heterogeneous surface sites. According to the initial conditions, the binding of the radionuclides to the solid phase resulted from weak and easily reversible sorption processes to strong association probably by inner sphere complexes.

Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in rainwater, southeastern North Carolina, USA	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												The abundance and optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were determined in 120 rain samples collected in Wilmington, North Carolina, USA, between February 21, 2002 and August 11, 2003. All rainwater samples contained chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as well as fluorescent compounds. The absorbance spectra of CDOM in the samples decreased exponentially with wavelength with little or no measurable absorbance past 550 nm. Fluorescence excitation emission spectra (EEMS) of the precipitation revealed the presence of four major peaks indicating both terrestrial and marine influences. There was a strong positive correlation between total integrated fluorescence and the absorbance coefficient at 300 nm in rainwater samples, suggesting that these optical properties are directly interrelated and that the compounds responsible for absorbance may be the same as those responsible for fluorescence. Air-mass back-trajectory analysis indicated elevated CDOM levels in continentally influenced rainwater relative to marine dominated events implying that anthropogenic and/or terrestrial sources are important contributors to CDOM levels in precipitation. The presence of highly absorbing and fluorescing CDOM in rainwater has significant ramifications in atmospheric chemistry and may play a previously unrecognized role in the wavelength dependent spectral attenuation of solar radiation by atmospheric waters.																	0167-7764					MAY	2006	54	1					21	41		10.1007/s10874-005-9008-4						WOS:000239354400002		
J	Nieto-Cid, M; Alvarez-Salgado, XA; Perez, FF				Nieto-Cid, M; Alvarez-Salgado, XA; Perez, FF			Microbial and photochemical reactivity of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in a coastal upwelling system	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We observed significant changes in the dissolved oxygen content and the fluorescence of humic substances and dissolved aromatic amino acids after 24 h light and dark incubations in the coastal upwelling system of the Ria de Viao under a wide variety of meteorologic and oceanographic conditions. Respiration rates were inversely related with the net production of humic fluorescence in the dark at a net rate of -0.027 +/- 0.003 mu g equivalents of quinine sulphate per mu mol of O-2, suggesting that marine humics are a by-product of the bacterial respiration of dissolved organic matter (DOM). On the contrary, humic fluorescence consumption in the light minus dark incubations was positively correlated with the net production in the dark, indicating a rapid photodegradation of recently produced marine humic substances. Parallel incubation experiments demonstrated that daily photodegradation rates and residual humic fluorescence levels followed a seasonal pattern characterized by a marked autumn maximum. Finally, a significant linear correlation between the gross primary production (PLY) and the net production of aromatic amino acids fluorescence in the light pointed to the rapid consumption of dissolved protein-like materials at a net average rate of -1.4 +/- 0.2 ppb equivalents of tryptophan per day, which accumulates in the water column only when Pg exceeds 80 20 mu mol kg(-1) d(-1).

On the possibility of differentiation of natural waters by the data on multiband fluorometry of dissolved organic matter	OCEANOLOGY												A submersible eight-channel filter-fluorometer was constructed for the estimation of the variability of the ratio between the integral intensities of several bands of the fluorescence spectrum of dissolved organic agents in natural water excited in specified wavelength intervals. The filter- fluorometer was used to obtain three vertical profiles of the fluorescence intensity at 18 points in Kaliningrad Bay of the Baltic Sea in the spectral bands at 415, 458, and 510 nm emitted simultaneously from the water column excited by the ultraviolet radiation in the interval from 320 to 380 nm. It was shown that a pronounced ( tens of times as much) relative ( between the spectral bands) variability of the fluorescence allows a number of water conditions to be recognized. The correlations of the multiband fluorometric information with the biohydrochemical and ecological characteristics of the water still require clarification.

J	Mohapatra, D; Mishra, D; Chaudhury, GR; Das, RP				Mohapatra, D; Mishra, D; Chaudhury, GR; Das, RP			Effect of dissolved organic matter on the adsorption and stability of As(V) on manganese wad	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												The efficiency of manganese wad to adsorb As(V) was tested as a function of pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and initial As(V) concentration. The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the adsorption properties of As(V) and stability of As(V) bearing manganese wad was also studied. The major mineral phases found in the manganese wad were goethite, hematite, lithiophorite, and gibbsite. Under optimum conditions (pH 6.5, adsorbent dose 30 g/L), As(V) was lowered to 0.42,0.18, and 0.05 mg/L from 10, 5, and 2.5 mg/L, respectively, in the solution. Adsorption capacity was calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model and found to be 2.15 mg/g adsorbent. The presence of DOM had significant negative effects on As(V) adsorption in the whole pH range studied, whereas the corresponding data for DOM adsorption in presence of As(V) were pH dependent. Leaching studies showed that DOM could extract maximum 4.16 mg/L (4.40%) of the adsorbed As(V) under optimum conditions from As(V) loaded manganese wad residue. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Karlsson, T; Persson, P; Skyllberg, U				Karlsson, T; Persson, P; Skyllberg, U			Complexation of copper(II) in organic soils and in dissolved organic matter - EXAFS evidence for chelate ring structures	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Associations with functional groups of natural organic matter (NOM) are of great importance for bioavailability, toxicity, and mobility of trace metals in soils and waters. In this study, the coordination chemistry of copper, Cu(II), in organic soils and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils and streams was investigated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. In both soil organic matter (SOM) and DOM (990-11 000 mu g Cu g(-1) dry weight, pH 2.8-6.3), Cu(II)was coordinated by 4 oxygen/nitrogen (O/N) atoms at a distance of 1.92-1.95 angstrom in the first coordination shell. These four atoms are positioned in the equatorial plane of a Jahn-Teller distorted octahedron. In samples with a pH of 4.8-6.3, a second coordination shell with 2.0-3.8 C atoms was located at a distance of 2.76-2.86 angstrom. A significant improvement (19-39%) of the fit was obtained by including a third coordination shell with 2.0-3.8 O/C atoms involved in single scattering at an average distance of 3.69 angstrom and multiple scattering at an average distance of 4.19 angstrom. Our results provide evidence for inner-sphere complexation of Cu(II) in NOM and suggest that Cu(II) is complexed by either one or two five-membered chelate rings involving possible combinations of amino, carboxyl, or carbonyl functional groups. Ion activity measurements showed that less than 0.2% of total Cu was in the form of free Cu2+ in our samples at pH 4.8-6.3.

J	Hoge, FE				Hoge, FE			Beam attenuation coefficient retrieval by inversion of airborne lidar-induced chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence. 1. Theory	APPLIED OPTICS												It is shown that the oceanic beam attenuation coefficient can be retrieved from airborne laser-induced and depth-resolved chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence. The radiative transfer equation (RTE) retrieval methodology does not require a laser beam spread function model since two CDOM fluorescence bands are used in conjunction with a beam attenuation spectral model, is self-normalizing since the CDOM absorption coefficient and laser beam irradiance are common to both fluorescence observational channels, and is enabled by the known isotropic phase function for CDOM fluorescence. Although this RTE analytical inversion theory is exact, the retrieval uncertainty is reduced by configuring the proposed lidar in the multiple-field-of-view beam attenuation mode to significantly diminish observation of multiple scattering. The theory can be applied over wide regions of the ocean's continental margins, estuaries, lakes, and rivers that are known to have sufficient CDOM.

J	Hur, J; Williams, MA; Schlautman, MA				Hur, J; Williams, MA; Schlautman, MA			Evaluating spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques to resolve dissolved organic matter via end member mixing analysis	CHEMOSPHERE												Real-time or near real-time in-situ monitoring of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in natural waters and engineered treatment systems provides critical information to water quality scientists and engineers, particularly when the monitoring techniques can provide some information about the chemical nature of DOM. The efficacy of various indices derived from rapid, low-cost spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques to discriminate DOM composition was tested for samples prepared from well-defined mixtures of purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) and Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA). Sensitivities of the discrimination indices were examined by comparing (1) the differences between measured values and those predicted based from mass balance and the end member characteristics, and (2) the linear correlations between index values and mass ratios of the DOM mixtures. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results revealed that the weight-average molecular weight (MWw) may be a useful approach for tracking DOM mixing processes, although the number-average molecular weight (MWn) may be better for distinguishing different DOM compositions. Specific ultraviolet absorbance measured at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) performed better as a discrimination index than did two previously recommended absorbance ratios, both in terms of making better predictions of intermediate compositions and in exhibiting a more linear correlation with PAHA mass ratio. Several well-defined peaks in the derivative absorption spectra (301 and 314 nm for the first derivative, 217 nm for the third derivative. and 211 and 224 nm for the fourth derivative) also were found to be promising potential DOM discrimination indices. Finally, a fluorescence ratio based on humic-versus fulvic-like fluorescence proved to be a superior DOM discrimination index for the two DOM end members studied here. In general, this study illustrates the evaluation process that should be followed to develop rapid, low-cost discrimination indices to monitor DOM compositions based on end member mixing analyses.

J	Fisher, JM; Reese, JG; Pellechia, PJ; Moeller, PL; Ferry, JL				Fisher, JM; Reese, JG; Pellechia, PJ; Moeller, PL; Ferry, JL			Role of Fe(III), phosphate, dissolved organic matter, and nitrate during the photodegradation of domoic acid in the marine environment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The photodegradation of domoic acid in model seawater containing varying amounts of total Fe(III) (expressed as Fe(III)), NO3-, total phosphate (expressed as PO43-), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) is reported. A multivariate, microscale, high-throughput experimental approach is described for evaluating how these components interact to control the removal of domoic acid from natural waters. Under the nominal conditions of the study ([Fe(III)](0) 0-4 mu; [NO3-](0) 0-35 mu M; [PO43-](0) 0-4 mu M; [DOM](0) 0-10 mg/L), it is apparent that Fe(III) and DOM are significant promoters of domoic acid photooxidation. In contrast, PO43- interacts with Fe(III) to inhibit the photooxidation of domoic acid, but PO43- alone does not act to slow or accelerate domoic acid photodegradation. No other variables (singly or interactively) have a statistically significant impact. At an incident light intensity of 765 W/m(2) and initial domoic acid concentration of 0.96 mu M, domoic acid half-lives range over 12-36 h, with half-life a function of [Fe(Ill)], [PO43-], and dissolved organic matter loadings. An NMR based technique for measuring domoic acid-Fe(III) binding (1.72 x 10(11)) is reported.

We tested the response of the prokaryotic community to three different DOM fractions prepared by ultrafiltration. One of the DOM fractions contained phages (< 0.2 m), a second was virus-free (< 100 kDa), and a third contained only low molecular weight (< 1 kDa). The proportion of Vibrio and SRF3 populations as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization in the community ranged from < 1 to 6.2% and from 3.2 to 6.3%, respectively. Based on changes in cell numbers, growth rates ranged from 2.1 to 3.1 day(-1) for Vibrio and from 0.8 to 1.2 day(-1) for SRF3. Growth rates of Vibrio were similar or higher than those of the total prokaryotic community, whereas the ability of Vibrio to use high molecular weight (HMW) DOM and the responses to additions of phage-rich material were lower. Growth rates of SRF3 were lower than that of the community. Susceptibility to infection of SRF3 was sometimes lower than in the community, whereas the growth stimulation of HMW DOM was similar or lower. Reducing the cell concentrations of the prokaryotic community by dilution stimulated the overall growth of the community, including that of its constituent Vibrio and SRF3 populations, but the effect was smaller on the SRF3 and greater on Vibrio populations than for the total community. Comparisons with the community also revealed that life strategy traits of bacterial populations differed between coastal and offshore waters. Overall, our data suggest that Vibrio is an r-strategist or opportunistic population in the NW Mediterranean Sea, whereas SRF3 is a K-strategist or equilibrium population.

J	Fang, D; Zhou, LX				Fang, D; Zhou, LX			Effect of sludge dissolved organic matter on oxidation of ferrous iron and sulfur by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Although two species of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, are widely considered to be the main microorganisms that control the process of bioleaching of heavy metals from sewage sludge, little is known about the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in sewage sludge on bacterial oxidation of energy substrate. Batch cultures studies showed that sludge DOM significantly inhibited ferrous iron and sulfur oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans LX5 and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans TS6, respectively. The toxicity of sludge DOM appeared when the concentration was higher than 150 mg DOC L-1. Among the organic compounds tested, the monocarboxylic organic acids including formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid exhibited a marked toxicity to Acidithiobacillus species. Of these organic acids, formic acid was the most toxic one as indicating that iron and sulfur oxidation almost were entirely inhibited at a concentration of 1.67 mM. In addition, it was found that A. ferrooxidans LX5 was more sensitive to glucose, starch, and citric acid than A. thiooxidans TS6, while the former seemed to be more acetic, propionic, and butyric acid resistant than the latter. In the selected 150 mg DOC L-1 stop of DOM derived from Sludge-H, the concentrations of formic acid and acetic acid were 8.94 mM and 2.09 mM, respectively, being a contributing factor causing 95% inhibition of iron oxidation and 70% inhibition of sulfur oxidation. To exploit specific heterotrophic microorganisms to eliminate these toxic organic compounds should be further studied.																	0049-6979					APR	2006	171	1-4					81	94		10.1007/s11270-005-9014-9						WOS:000236828700007		
J	He, PJ; Xue, JF; Shao, LM; Li, GJ; Lee, DJ				He, PJ; Xue, JF; Shao, LM; Li, GJ; Lee, DJ			Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in recycled leachate of bioreactor landfill	WATER RESEARCH												Landfill leachate needs sufficient treatment before safe disposal. Bioreactor landfill technology could effectively degrade the organic matters in recirculated leachate, hence leaving a leachate stream of low biodegradability. This study characterized the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the leachate from simulated bioreactor landfill columns with or without presence of trace oxygen. The removal efficiencies of this DOM using coagulation-sedimentation or electrolysis processes were demonstrated. Recirculated leachates were sampled from the simulated landfill columns applying conventional mode, intermittent-aeration mode, and natural aeration mode, whose DOM was fractionated into humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and hydrophilic fractions (HyI) by the XAD-8 resin combined with the cation exchange resin method. The recirculated leachate had low BOD/COD ratio, high humic substances contents, and high aromatic content. Their HA fraction comprised mainly large molecules (> 10 k Da), while the FA and HyI were composed of smaller molecules (< 50 k and < 4 k Da, respectively). With the presence of oxygen, the TOC contents and the contents of HA, FA and HyI in leachate reduced, with FA and HyI fractions of molecular weight (MW) lower than 4 k Da more readily degraded. The organic matters left in leachates from intermittent-aeration mode and natural aeration mode were of low biodegradability. it was tested in the following sections the effects of coagulation-sedimentation process and of electrolysis process on the removal of residual DOM in recirculated leachate. Coagulation-sedimentation tests revealed that poly ferric sulphate (PFS) could remove more COD (58.1%) from leachate than polyaluminum chloride (PACI) (22.9%), particularly on the HA fraction with MW > 10 k Da. Coagulation-sedimentation could not remove most of HyI in leachate. Furthermore, the corresponding BOD/COD ratio was not improved through coagulation. Electrolysis test could also effectively removed HA of MW > 10 k Da. However, the biodegradability of treated effluent considerably was improved. The electrolysis could decompose high MW substances and increase biodegradability of recirculated leachate from bioreactor landfill. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Doig, LE; Liber, K				Doig, LE; Liber, K			Influence of dissolved organic matter on nickel bioavailability and toxicity to Hyalella azteca in water-only exposures	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to reduce the bioavailability of metals in aquatic systems. This study evaluated the effects of DOM from various sources (e.g., Little Bear Lake sediment. Suwannee River, peat noss) and various DOM fractions (humic acids, HA; fulvic acids, FA) on the bioavailability of nickel (Ni) to Hyalella azteca, a common freshwater benthic invertebrate. In particular, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of surficial sediment DOM on Ni bioavailability. Shortterm (48 h) acute toxicity tests with H. azteca conducted in synthetic water demonstrated that the aqueous Ni concentrations required for lethality were greater than what could be significantly complexed by environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC: 0.6-30.4 mg/L). At Ni concentrations sublethal to H. azteca (500 mu g/L), the bioavailability of Ni was significantly reduced in the presence of representative surface water DOC concentrations regardless of DOC source or fraction. DOC fraction (i.e., FA and HA) differentially affected Ni speciation, but had little or no effect on Ni accumulation by H. azteca. Tissue Ni was found to be strongly dependent upon the Ni2+ concentration in the exposure solutions and the Ni:DOC ratio. Overall, the concentration of DOC played a greater role than either DOC source or fraction in determining Ni speciation and hence bioavailability and toxicity to H. azteca. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Grannas, AM; Martin, CB; Chin, YP; Platz, M				Grannas, AM; Martin, CB; Chin, YP; Platz, M			Hydroxyl radical production from irradiated arctic dissolved organic matter	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The hydroxyl radical (OH center dot) plays an important role in the environmental chemistry and biogeochemistry of surface waters. OH center dot acts as a strong oxidant within the irradiated water column, and affects the bioavailability, cycling, and mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), the speciation and redox state of important trace metals e.g., iron and copper, and the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The generation of this species from irradiated DOM may be especially important in Arctic surface waters during the boreal summer, which contains high levels of DOM and experiences continual solar irradiance. Here, we investigate the OH center dot produced from laser irradiated Arctic DOM isolated from Toolik Lake, AK (68 degrees 38' N, 149 degrees 43' W). We measured the wavelength dependence of OH center dot production for aqueous solutions of DOM and report that the greatest OH center dot production occurs at wavelengths less than 360 nm. OH center dot production rates ranged from 1.7 (+/- 0.1)x10(-7) M h(-1) to 6.4 (+/- 0.2)x10(-7) M h(-1), with the rate depending on both irradiation wavelength and to a lesser degree the method used to isolate the DOM matrix. These findings lead to a better understanding of the potentially important photo-oxidation processes that may impact DOM cycling in the Arctic.

J	Kim, S; Kaplan, LA; Hatcher, PG				Kim, S; Kaplan, LA; Hatcher, PG			Biodegradable dissolved organic matter in a temperate and a tropical stream determined from ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated dissolved organic matter (DOM) metabolism by employing plug-flow biofilm reactors and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry of DOM isolated by C, extraction in two forested stream ecosystems, a low DOM tropical stream sampled at baseflow and a higher DOM temperate stream sampled during a storm. On passage through the bioreactors, DOM concentrations in the tropical stream sample declined by 22%, whereas they declined by 42% in the temperate stream sample. The extracted DOM was subjected to electrospray ionization coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to obtain information on molecular weight distributions and elemental compositions for the thousands of compounds whose masses are calculated with sufficient accuracy to allow calculation of unique elemental formulas. In both streams, metabolism modifies DOM to lower molecular weight molecules, and oxygen-rich molecules are selectively biodegraded. Applying van Krevelen analyses for the unique elemental formulas of DOM constituents revealed that hydrogen-deficient molecules with low H: C ratios (assigned to black carbon-derived molecules) are present and generally not metabolized. Black carbon molecules are refractory to biodegradation compared with other components of DOM, supporting the suggestion that black carbon molecules in DOM flow to the ocean without experiencing significant microbial degradation.																	0024-3590					MAR	2006	51	2					1054	1063								WOS:000236343600026

The results show that the DOM samples and FHA fluorescence properties changed under sunlight irradiation. Interestingly, the photodegradation characteristics were different between aquatic DOM and FHA. The fluorescence intensity of the apparent peaks A, B and C of lake and river water DOM decreased with sunlight irradiation. The initial 3DEEM of Fluka HA had only one fluorescence peak at lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 275/500 nm, while two fluorescence peaks occurred at lambda(ex)/lambda(em) =245/450 nm and 310/450 nm, respectively, after sunlight irradiation. lambda(ex) and lambda(em) maxima of DOM decreased during 7 days of sunlight irradiation. Changes in r (A, C) of DOM and FHA with sunlight irradiation time suggest that fluorescence peaks A and C had different fluorescence loss rates, while peak C fluorophores were more susceptible to sunlight irradiation. FHA appeared to be less susceptible to photodegradation, and its r(A, C) remained almost the same before and after sunlight irradiation.

J	Jonsson, J; Sjoberg, S; Lovgren, L				Jonsson, J; Sjoberg, S; Lovgren, L			Adsorption of Cu(II) to schwertmannite and goethite in presence of dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												Sorption processes involving secondary iron minerals may significantly contribute to immobilisation of metals in soils and surface waters. in the present work the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a concentrated bog-water on the adsorption of Cu(II) onto schwertmannite (Fe8O8(OH)(6)SO4) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH) has been studied. The acid/ base behaviour of DOM up to pH 6 was explained by assuming a diprotic acid with a density of carboxylate groups of 6.90 mu eq (mg C)(-1). The resulting acidity constants, recalculated to zero ionic strength were pK(a1)(0) = 3.61 and pK(a2)(0) = 5.34. The uptake of DOM to schwertmannite and goethite was highest at low pH although adsorption was significant also under mildly alkaline conditions. Adsorption to the two minerals was similar although at high pH more DOM was adsorbed to schwertmannite than to goethite. DOM enhanced the adsorption of Cu(II) at moderately low pH in the goethite system but there was no effect of DOM in the case of schwertmannite. The presence of Cu(II) resulted in a decreased adsorption of DOM to goethite at weakly acidic pH and increased adsorption at high pH. In the case of schwertmannite, Cu(II) did not affect DOM uptake.

J	Gueguen, C; Guo, LD; Wang, D; Tanaka, N; Hung, CC				Gueguen, C; Guo, LD; Wang, D; Tanaka, N; Hung, CC			Chemical characteristics and origin of dissolved organic matter in the Yukon River	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Monthly ( or bi-weekly) water samples were collected from the Yukon River, one of the largest rivers in North America, at a station near the US Geological Survey Stevens Village hydrological station, Alaska from May to September 2002, to examine the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its seasonal variations. DOM was further size fractionated into high molecular weight (HMW or colloidal, 1 kDa - 0.45 mu m) and low molecular weight (LMW, < 1 kDa) fractions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), colored dissolved organic matter (C-DOM) and total dissolved carbohydrate (TCHO) species were measured in the size fractionated DOM samples. Concentrations of DOC were as high as 2830 mu mol-C l(-1) during the spring breakup in May and decreased significantly to 508 - 558 mu mol- C l(-1) during open-water season ( June - September). Within the DOC pool, up to 85% was in the colloidal fraction ( 1 kDa - 0.45 mu m) in early May. As DOC concentration decreased, this colloidal portion remained high ( 70 - 85% of the bulk DOC) throughout the sampling season. Concentrations of TCHO, including monosaccharides (MCHO) and polysaccharides (PCHO), varied from 722 mu mol-C l(-1) in May to 129 mu mol- C l(-1) in September, which comprised a fairly constant portion of bulk DOC ( 24 +/- 2%). Within the TCHO pool, the MCHO/TCHO ratio consistently increased from May to September. The C-DOM/DOM ratio and the size fractionated DOM increased from May to September, indicating that DOM draining into the Yukon River contained increased amounts of humified materials, likely related to a greater soil leaching efficiency in summer. The average composition of DOM was 76% pedogenic humic matter and 24% aquagenic CHO. Characteristics of soil-derived humic substances and low chlorophyll-a concentrations support a dominance of terrestrial DOM in Yukon River waters.

The effect of increasing N inputs to forest soils on the structure and composition of both SOM and DOM also remains largely unclear. Here we studied the release of DOM, its specific UV absorption and two humification indices (HIX) derived from fluorescence spectra from Oa material of 15 North- and Central-European Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands. The Oa material was incubated aerobically at 15 degrees C and water holding capacity over a period of 10 months and extracted monthly with an artificial throughfall solution. Soil respiration was determined weekly. The influence of mineral N inputs on composition of DOM and on respiration rates was investigated on periodically NH4NO3-treated Oa samples of eight selected sites. Release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from untreated Oa material samples ranged from 0.0 to 58.6 mu g C day(-1) g C-1 and increased with increasing C-to-N ratio. One HIX and UV absorption of DOM were negatively correlated to the degree of oxidation of lignin-derived compounds and positively to the C-to-N ratio and-HIX only-to the aromatic C content of SOM. Mineral N addition had no distinct effect on respiration rates. In six of eight samples the N-treatment caused an increase in specific UV absorption or one HIX of DOM. However, these effects were not statistically significant. Addition of mineral N did not affect the rates of DOM release. Our results show that properties of SOM largely determine the amount and quality of DOM in forest floors. Changes of DOM quality due to mineral N additions are likely, but we cannot confirm significant changes of DOM release. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper describes an incubation experiment by which the lability and mobility of DOM extracted from forest-floor materials are related to their age and degree of degradation. DOM extracted from a chronosequence of decomposing leaves (green leaves, fresh fallen leaves, litter [1 y weathering], fibric matter [2-3 y], hemic matter [> 3 y], or peat [100+ y]) was applied to intact soil cores, and the CO2 produced over 5 d was measured to determine biodegradability. Biodegradability of DOM varied somewhat along the chronosequence, with the green leaves yielding more CO2 on an equal C basis than the older substrates and equivalent to glucose which was used as a reference substrate. Thus, the DOM extracts of the older substrates contain some refractory components. The humic-acid content (or that of its precursors) of the extracts from older substrates relates to the lowered lability. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic content of DOM extracted from substrates was not related to CO2 production in the incubation studies conducted.

J	Han, SH; Gill, GA; Lehman, RD; Choe, KY				Han, SH; Gill, GA; Lehman, RD; Choe, KY			Complexation of mercury by dissolved organic matter in surface waters of Galveston Bay, Texas	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The chemical speciation of dissolved mercury in surface waters of Galveston Bay was determined using the concentrations of mercury-complexing ligands and conditional stability constants of mercury-ligand complexes. Two classes of natural ligands associated with dissolved organic matter were determined by a competitive ligand exchange-solvent solvent extraction (CLE-SSE) method: a strong class (L-S), ranging from 19 to 93 pM with an average conditional stability constant (K-HgLs) of 10(28), and a weak class (L-w) ranging from 1.4 to 9.8 nM with an average K-HgLs of 10(23). The range of conditional stability constants between mercury and natural ligands suggested that sulfides and thiolates are important binding sites for dissolved mercury in estuarine waters. A positive correlation between the estuarine distribution of dissolved glutathione and that of mercury-complexing ligands supported this suggestion. Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling using stability constants for HgL, HgClx, Hg(OH)(x), and HgCl(OH) and concentrations of each ligand demonstrated that almost all of the dissolved mercury (> 99%) in Galveston Bay was complexed by natural ligands associated with dissolved organic matter. The importance of low concentrations of high-affinity ligands that may originate in the biological system (i.e., glutathione and phytochelatin) suggests that the greater portion of bulk dissolved organic matter may not be important for mercury complexation in estuarine surface waters.

J	Bauer, M; Blodau, C				Bauer, M; Blodau, C			Mobilization of arsenic by dissolved organic matter from iron oxides, soils and sediments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The arsenic contamination of aquifers has been linked to the input of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In light of this suggestion, the aim of this study was to quantify chemical effects of DOM on desorption and redox transformations of arsenic bound to synthetic iron oxide and natural samples from different geochemical environments (soils, shallow aquifer, lake sediment). In batch experiments, solutions containing 25-50 mg/L of two different types of DOM (purified peat humic acid and DOM from a peat drainage) were used as extractants in comparison to inorganic solutions. DOM solution was able to mobilize arsenic from all solid phases. Mobilization from iron oxides (maximum: 53.3%) was larger than from natural samples (maximum: 2.9%). The mobilization effect of extractants decreased in the order HCl > NaH2PO4 > DOM > NaNO3. DOM solutions, therefore, mainly targeted weakly sorbed arsenic. Mobilization was complete within 24-36 h and DOM was sorbed during incubation indicating competition for sorption sites. The same patterns were observed for different DOM types and concentrations. Addition of DOM lead to (a) enhanced reduction (maximum 7.8%) and oxidation (6.4%) of arsenic in aqueous solution and (b) the appearance of arsenite in aqueous phase of soil samples (5.5%). As the primary mechanism for the arsenic release from solid phases we identified the competition between arsenic and organic anions for sorption sites, whereas redox reactions were probably of minor importance. The results of this study demonstrate that sorption of DOM has a strong potential to mobilize arsenic from soils and sediments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Variation of dissolved organic matter and microbial regrowth potential through drinking water treatment processes	5th World Water Congress: Drinking Water Quality and Treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: WATER SUPPLY				5th World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association	SEP 10-14, 2006	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Water Assoc				We investigated how various water treatment processes affect AOC (assimilable organic carbon) and MAP (microbially available phosphorus), which nutrient limits microbial growth between organic carbon and phosphorus, and what extent AOC is related to the MW fractions of NOM for raw waters of the Han River and process waters of two water treatment plants in Korea. In view of our results so far achieved, a significant difference was observed between MAP and MAP-P (potential MAP), while little difference was observed between AOC and AOC-P (potential AOC) for raw and pre-chlorinated waters, suggesting that organic carbon limits microbial growth instead of phosphorus. Conventional treatment processes poorly removed AOC-P (42.8%), since the AOC, which was mainly related to the small-molecular DOC, was hardly removed by conventional processes. Oxidants such as chlorine and ozone increased both of the AOC (AOC-P) and MAP (MAP-P), particularly ozone having the stronger oxidation power resulted in a larger increase. However, BAC and GAC removed AOC to less than 60 mu g/L which meets the level for biological stability.																	1606-9749		978-1-84339-588-1				2006	6	4					57	66		10.2166/ws.2006.904						WOS:000243855100007

During our sampling period (September 19-22, 2002), DOM concentration ranged from 4 to 35 mg C L-1 across streams. DOM M-w and epsilon(280) also showed considerable variation among streams. Multiple factor regression showed that stream DOM concentrations were related to watershed area, mean watershed slope, and the percentage of watershed area in certain types of land cover (lake, total wetlands, emergent wetlands, and lowland conifer forests). Streams with higher DOM concentration also had higher DOM M-w and molar absorptivity. Moreover, DOM M-w and epsilon(280) were negatively related to the % lake and positively related to the % total wetlands in the watershed. In general, landscape variables explained more among stream variation in DOM concentration than in DOM M-w or epsilon(280) in this watershed. It thus appears that the many biogeochemical processes controlling DOM input, transportation, and degradation weaken relationships between stream DOM composition and terrestrial organic matter dynamics in this relatively large watershed. Our results indicate that the total proportion of wetlands alone may be inadequate to predict DOM concentration or physicochemistry in streams flowing from large watersheds of variable morphology and land cover composition.

J	Biester, H; Selimovic, D; Hemmerich, S; Petri, M				Biester, H; Selimovic, D; Hemmerich, S; Petri, M			Halogens in pore water of peat bogs - the role of peat decomposition and dissolved organic matter	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Halogens are strongly enriched in peat and peatlands and such they are one of their largest active terrestrial reservoir. The enrichment of halogens in peat is mainly attributed to the formation of organohalogens and climatically controlled humification processes. However, little is known about release of halogens from the peat substrate and the distribution of halogens in the peat pore water. In this study we have investigated the distribution of chlorine, bromine and iodine in pore water of three pristine peat bogs located in the Magellanic Moorlands, southern Chile. Peat pore waters were collected using a sipping technique, which allows in situ sampling down to a depth greater than 6 m. Halogens and halogen species in pore water were determined by ion-chromatography (IC) (chlorine) and IC-ICPMS (bromine and iodine). Results show that halogen concentrations in pore water are 15-30 times higher than in rainwater. Mean concentrations of chlorine, bromine and iodine in pore water were 7-15 mg l(-1), 56-123 g l(-1), and 10-20 g l(-1), which correspond to mean proportions of 10-15%, 1-2.3% and 0.5-2.2% of total concentrations in peat, respectively. Organobromine and organoiodine were the predominant species in pore waters, whereas chlorine in pore water was mostly chloride. Advection and diffusion of halogens were found to be generally low and halogen concentrations appear to reflect release from the peat substrate. Release of bromine and iodine from peat depend on the degree of peat degradation, whereas this relationship is weak for chlorine. Relatively higher release of bromine and iodine was observed in less degraded peat sections, where the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was also the most intensive. It has been concluded that the release of halogenated dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the predominant mechanism of iodine and bromine release from peat.																	1726-4170						2006	3	1					53	64								WOS:000236196000004

It is well accepted that fluorescence characteristics and molecular weight distribution are -two important parameters in the DOM characterization. However, the relationship between them is still unknown. In this study, fluorescence and molecular weight distribution of DOM in Lake Hongfeng, Lake Baihua and their rivers, and their relationship were investigated using the combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) with on-line UV absorbance and fluorescence detectors. The results show that there were two obvious humic-like fluorescence peaks (Peaks A and B) in DOM from lake water. But there was another obvious protein-like fluorescence peak (Peak C) in DOM from river water. The humic-like fluorescence material consisted of DOM fraction with smaller molecular weight, ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 kDa, while the protein-like fluorescence material mainly consisted of DOM fraction with MW larger than 2.0 kDa. The calculation of MW using HPSEC was related to the UV absorbance wavelength chosen.

It represents a dominant absorbing species in natural waters and therefore it plays a critical role in controlling the light distribution in aquatic environments. CDOM shows a featureless absorption spectrum that increases exponentially with decreasing wavelength. Under light exposure CDOM loses its optical properties (photobleaching), altering the aquatic light field. Field and laboratory studies indicate that the CDOM photobleaching can represent a quite significant sink of this material over a short time scale.																	1568-1238		1-4020-3695-7				2006	57						203	+								WOS:000236077800016

Water samples were taken from the borehole at the landfill, outside from it and from the Sava River nearby the landfill. It has been shown that of all raw water samples that from borehole at the landfill site had the highest content of organic matter (28 me, NPOC/L). The dissolved organic matter was fractionated by ultrafiltration to the selected molecular mass ranges (<10000, 10000-50000 and 50000-500000). Trihalomethane formation potential was calculated in the raw water samples and the selected molecular size fractions after chlorination with sodium hypochlorite, with respect to the concentration of dissolved organic matter at pH 7 +/- 0.2, temperature of 25 +/- 1 degrees C and 168 hours reaction. Trihalomethane concentrations in aqueous solution were determined after extraction by gas chromatography/ electron capture detection. After chlorination, chloroform was the dominant trihalomethane (>90%), followed by bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane. Fifty to sixty per cent of total trihalomethanes were developed with-in 24 hours, and each molecular size fraction indicated trihalomethane formation potential.																	1018-4619						2006	15	11					1447	1454								WOS:000242493600014

YM 158 and NM 9) to the herbicide chlorotoluron and the effect of two forms of dissolved organic matter on the chlorotoluron toxicity to the plants were characterized. Treatment with chlorotoluron at 10-50 mu g/ml inhibited the seed germination and a dose-response was observed. The inhibition of seed germination was correlated to the depression of alpha-amylase activities. To identify whether chlorotoluron induced oxidative damage to wheat plants, the malondlaldehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage were measured. Results showed that both MDA content and electrolyte leakage in the chlorotoluron-treated roots significantly increased. Activities of several key enzymes were measured that operate in citric acid cycle and carbohydrate metabolic pathway. Inhibited activities of citrate synthase and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase were observed in the chlorotoluron-treated roots as compared to control plants. We also examined malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in wheat roots exposed to 30 mu g/ml chlorotoluron. However, none of the enzymes showed significant changes in activities. Application of 160 mu g/ml dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from non-treated sludge(NTS) and heat-expanded sludge (HES) in the medium with 30 mu g/ml chlorotoluron induced an additive inhibition of seed germination and plant growth. The inhibition of growth due to the DOM treatment was associated with the depression of activities of (X-amylase, citrate synthase and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, as well as the increase in malondlaldehyde content and electrolyte leakage. These results suggested that the presence of DOM might enhance the uptake and accumulation of chlorotoluron, and thus resulted in greater toxicity in wheat plants. The two forms of DOM exhibited differences in regulation of chlorotoluron toxicity to the wheat plants. Treatments with DOM-NTS induced greater toxicity to plants as compared to those with DOM-HES. In addition to DOM affecting chlorotoluron-induced toxicity to wheat plants, the cultivars could have also contributed to differences. Generally, NM-9 showed a higher sensitivity to chlorotoluron than YM 158 either in the absence or in the presence of DOM.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2006	18	1					101	108								WOS:000234759500019	20050556

Basin-scale, seasonal measurements of DOM concentrations revealed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) accumulated in the epilimnion during warm seasons and were redistributed into the deeper layer during winter overturn. Hypolimnetic DOC and DON decreased in concentration over the stratification period, indicating mineralization; the contributions of DOM to the total mineralization of C and N were 8% and 30%, respectively. Higher contribution of N relative to C suggests that the N-rich DOM was mineralized at depth. We failed to detect a significant contribution of dissolved organic phosphorus to P mineralization in the hypolimnion, which could be explained by substantial depletion in P relative to C and N of DOM; C: P and N: P ratios were 1,978 and 147, respectively. The data suggest that convective mixing in this monomictic basin delivers DOM to hypolimnetic depths, where it is mineralized during subsequent periods of stratification.																	0024-3590					JAN	2006	51	1					70	78								WOS:000237399700008

C: N, stable isotope (delta C-13), and lipid biomarker analyses revealed differences in the inferred reactivity of autochthonous versus allochthonous OM sources. Isotopic comparison of OM size fractions and bacterial nucleic acids suggests that high-molecular-weight dissolved OM (DOM) is consistently linked to bacterial biomass synthesis along the estuarine salinity gradient. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (as percent of total fatty acids, FA) were a reliable predictor of DOM decomposition in bioassays, thus providing an indicator directly linking DOM reactivity to its composition. Significant positive correlations between FA diagnostic of bacterial sources and lipid biomarker compounds diagnostic of planktonic origin indicate a systematic bacterial response to autochthonous DOM sources along the estuarine continuum. These findings further suggest that, although the geochemical signature of algal-derived OM in the dissolved phase may appear quantitatively insignificant, this fraction may nevertheless represent a principal source of bioreactive OM to heterotrophic bacteria in estuarine waters.																	0024-3590					JAN	2006	51	1					94	100								WOS:000237399700010

Sterile filtered water from a eutrophic and a humic lake, that was either exposed to artificial ultraviolet (UV) radiation or kept dark, was added to semicontinuous laboratory microcosms that lasted for 7 weeks. Bacterial production responded positively to photochemical modification of DOM regardless of lake type. Final heterotrophic biomass (bacteria + proto + metazooplankton) was 47 +/- 5 and 37 +/- 5 mu g carbon (C) L-1 in microcosms with UV-exposed and unaltered eutrophic water DOM and 15 +/- 4 and 11 +/- 2 mu g C L-1 in microcosms with UV-exposed and unaltered humic water DOM, respectively. For the eutrophic water, there were no significant differences in proto- or metazooplankton biomasses between microcosms receiving UV-exposed or nonexposed DOM. Differences between eutrophic water microcosms were not significant when flagellates, ciliates, cladocerans, and copepods were examined separately. In microcosms with UV-exposed humic water, biomasses of heterotrophic flagellates, rotifers, nauplii, and cladocerans were higher than in those with nonexposed DOM.

Although O. dioica was found to graze on CDOM, it also contributes to the CDOM pool. O. dioica cleared large, > 10 kDa CDOM, with clearance rates ranging from 0.5 ml d(-1) for humic material to 8.9 ml d-1 for proteins suggesting a differential cycling of dissolved organic material by this larvacean. Its excretion of CDOM was in the < 5 kDa size range. The clearance of large-sized CDOM (> 10 kDa) and the excretion of small-sized CDOM (< 5 kDa) resulted in an alteration of the molecular size distribution of the CDOM in natural seawater. Thus the relationship between grazing removal and excretion inputs will affect the cycling and molecular size distribution of CDOM and influence water color.																	0171-8630						2006	317						101	110		10.3354/meps317101						WOS:000239896600010

The detectable products are condensed aromatic ring structures extensively substituted with oxygen-containing functional groups, indicating that oxidation and dissolution of charcoal black carbon occurs on a centennial timescale. Many of the same species are also detected within the dissolved organic matter (DOM) of the forest's soil pore waters. We introduce the calculation of carbon normalized double bond equivalents (DBE/C) as a structural determinant for the empirical formulas obtained by mass spectral analysis. A threshold DBE/C value of 0.7 serves as a criterion for identifying species with condensed aromatic ring structures (CARS). A comparison with ultrahigh resolution mass spectra from previous studies shows that many of the CARS extracted directly from soil BC have the same mass (within 1 ppm) and empirical formulas as CARS detected in volcanic ash soil humic acid (HA) from Japan, and Amazonian Rio Negro DOM. The similarity of water-soluble condensed aromatics present within, and exported from fire-impacted soils of geographically and climatically disparate ecosystems indicates that the CARS reported herein are the molecular fingerprint of black carbon degradation in soils. Understanding the production mechanisms, reactivity, and fate of these molecular species should provide new insight to BC degradation and cycling. The soil charcoal particles at this site are infiltrated by filamentous microorganisms, suggesting that saprophytic fungi may be important to soil BC degradation processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

MSSV pyrolysis can reduce the polyhydroxylated alkyl side chain of bacteriohopanepolyols, yielding saturated hopane products which are more amenable to GC-MS detection than their functionalised precursors. This example demonstrates how the thermal conditions of MSSV pyrolysis can reduce the biologically-inherited structural functionality of naturally occurring organic matter such that additional structural fragments can be detected using GC methods. This approach complements traditional analytical pyrolysis methods by providing additional speciation information useful for establishing the structures and source inputs of recent or extant organic material.

Application of improved rapid mixing for enhanced removal of dissolved organic matter and DBPFP (disinfection by-product formation potential) control	PARTICLE SEPARATION 2005 - DRINKING WATER TREATMENT	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: WATER SUPPLY				IWA International Conference on Particle Separation	JUN 01-03, 2005	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	IWA				Dispersion of metal coagulant should be completed in a fraction of a second before the metal hydroxide precipitate has formed. For this reason, so-called pump diffusion flash mixing (PDFM) has been proposed, and PDFM is one reasonable method to quickly disperse the hydrolyzing metal salts. In this study, we attempt to understand the difference of removal characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM) between PDFM and conventional rapid mixing (CRM) in a water treatment system, and to enhance the removal of NOM through the improved mixing process. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and turbidity removal by PDFM was higher than those by CRM, while specific-ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of treated water by PDFM was higher than that by CRM. NOM was more effectively removed by PDFM compared to CRM due to quick and uniform dispersion of coagulants. Though the hydrophilic fraction found as major faction in bulk NOM from Han River water is enriched in haloacetic acid precursor sites as compared to hydrophobic fraction, the hydrophilic fraction was more effectively removed by PDFM rather than CRM. Therefore, PDFM is effective and innovative process in reduction of DOC and DBPFPs as well as turbidity, and requires lower coagulant dosage compared to CRM.																	1606-9749		1-84339-565-7				2006	6	1					49	57		10.2166/ws.2006.030						WOS:000239059800006

In the present study, S. platensis was grown in batch or semi-continuous cultures using the filtrate in the culture ponds that had not been renewed for years. It was found that disssolved organic carbon up to 60 mg/L did not bring about an inhibitory effect on the growth of S. platensis, but increased the contents of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin instead. However, further accumulation of dissolved organic matter could decrease the content of chlorophyll a.

In experiment, we obtained interesting data of DOM at 49.35m distance by changing the angle of excitation laser incidence to water. The concentration of the DOM is 3.325mg/I and the relative standard deviation is 2.65%.

Results showed that DOM mainly contributed to the attenuation at the ultraviolet, and the best correlation coefficient was at 355 nm. The absorption of DOM could be well described by the exponential decay model. The slope value S, retrieved from absorbance of 350 nm and 440 nm, was 0.0046 nm(-1)(SD=0.0015,n=284), far less than the published 0.014 nm(-1). The absorbance at 350 nm (a(350)) well correlated with DOM concentration (R-2=0.673, n=284), and also linearly correlated with fluorescence at 430 nm (R-2=0.497, n=214). The relationship between DOM concentration and fluorescence intensity was also regressed, and showed that it was polynomial.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-6513-9				2006	6406						B4061	B4061	64061B	10.1117/12.692319						WOS:000244435700033

It can be applied with the aim of reducing the total volume of MSW, thus lowering landfilling costs, and if properly treated after careful source separation it can be a source material for substrate used in greenhouses or to amend soils with OM. It is well known that compost maturity is of great importance from the point of view of the compost quality, as well as for cost optimization of the composting facility. Due to its importance and complexity, the search for ideal parameters of composting maturity is ongoing. Advanced chemical, physical and spectroscopic methods of compost maturity have been reviewed in this work. The bulk compost material has been the focus of earlier studies, yet HS and even more so the DOM and its fractions have become the focus of concern in more recent studies, as well as in the present one. It seems that DOM fractions are the most labile ones within the decomposing OM and therefore, the point at which changes in their content and composition occur seems to be a good indicator of maturity. Examination in detail of the DOM and its fractions with advanced chromatographic, spectroscopic and chemical techniques, along with the evaluation of metal binding to these fractions, was the aim of this review. It has been confirmed that decreased DOC and hydrolyzable carbohydrates are characteristic of the OM decomposition process taking place during composting. Hydrolyzable amino acid concentrations fluctuate, and therefore, cannot serve as indicators of maturity.																	1568-1238		978-1-4020-4728-2				2006	69						275	297								WOS:000271186900018		
J	Williams, CF; Letey, J; Farmer, WJ				Williams, CF; Letey, J; Farmer, WJ			Estimating the potential for facilitated transport of napropamide by dissolved organic matter	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been found to significantly affect the soil sorption/desorption of napropamide [2-(alpha-naphthoxy-N, N-diethylpropionamide] and to enhance its transport through soil columns. A method to qualitatively predict if DOM will enhance the transport of napropamide based on easily determined sorptive characteristics is investigated. Batch sorption experiments were specifically designed to simulate field application of napropamide. The formation of a napropamide-DOM complex was enhanced by pretreating soils with pesticide and allowing the carrier solvent to evaporate prior to preparing a water extract of the soil (K1). A second adsorption coefficient was measured by equilibrating K1 with untreated soil (K2). Column transport studies using the same soils as the batch equilibrium studies were performed. After allowing napropamide to dry, columns were leached. Initial leachate from all soils contained napropamide indicating that the collected napropamide had been transported through the column without adsorption. However, the amount leached was dependant on soil type and in general soils with higher organic matter content had higher concentrations of napropamide in the initial 30 mL of leachate when compared with lower organic matter (OM) soils. The ratio of the K1 and K2 solutions from the batch equilibrium studies were found to be positively correlated with the mass of napropamide in the initial leachate. Therefore the ratio of K1 to K2 provided a better qualitative predictor of the potential for facilitated transport of napropmamide than soil OM content.																	0361-5995					JAN-FEB	2006	70	1					24	30		10.2136/sssaj2001.0063						WOS:000235088200003

Spectral light absorption coefficients (in spectral range 400-800 rim), as well as the intensity of DOM fluorescence in three wave lengths (505, 525 and 540 rim) at the wave length of exciting radiation 390 nm have been determined. Total DOM concentration was defined by the standard method of bichromatic oxidation. In the studied water objects the relation of average efficacy (r= 0.6) between fluorescence intensity and DOM concentration as well as absence of relation between light absorbing and DOM concentration are noted. To get a qualitative and quantitative assessment of FDOM parameters the calculation algorithm was suggested based on similarity of dependency course (variations) of FDOM characteristics and corresponding dependencies of total DOM characteristics. The following parameters were used: coefficients which characterize inclination of spectral distribution of light absorption and DOM fluorescence, also specific coefficients of absorbing DOM and FDOM radiation at the wave length of fluorescence excitation (kappa(sp), kappa(f) (sp)), energy (and quantum) fluorescence efficiencies for DOM and its fluorescent fraction as well as specific fluorescence for DOM and FDOM, respectively. These calculations enabled to assess the most probable FDOM parameters. The FDOM share in the total DOM varies for studied waters from 8 to 40% at the average value 19%. The quantum efficiency varies from 0.18 to 0.40 (an average value is 0.28). Specific light absorption coefficients of DOM and FDOM are on average close between each other (kappa(f sp) / kappa(sp) makes 0.93). Some decrease of the share of fluorescent DOM fractions at the increase of both total DOM and FDOM was stated what says about different correlation of FDOM and non-fluorescent fractions in allochthonous OM due to which the main variations take place both in DOM and in indigenous OM which is formed in the water storage due to photosynthesis.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-6642-6				2006	6522						W5221	W5221	65221W	10.1117/12.723226						WOS:000245104400068

Wastewater dissolved organic matter: characteristics and sorptive capabilities	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												An evaluation of the mobility of organic pollutants with wastewater dissolved organic matter (DOM) is essential to better understanding their fate and toxicity to the environment. In this study, DOM from two wastewater treatment plants (in Lachish and Netanya, Israel) were fractionated to hydrophobic-acid (HoA) and hydrophobic-neutral (HoN) fractions. The fractions were characterised and their sorptive capabilities for s-triazine herbicides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were studied. For all sorbates, binding to the HoN fractions was much higher than to HoA fractions. The high binding coefficients obtained for the studied triazines by the HoN fractions suggested that their sorption is governed by hydrophobic-like interactions rather than H-bonding. The binding coefficients of PAHs measured for the HoN fractions were within the range reported for humic acids and much higher than for the HoA fraction, suggesting that the HoN fraction plays an important role in the overall sorption of these compounds by DOM. Higher sorption coefficients were measured for the Netanya DOM sample containing a higher level of hydrophobic fractions (HoA + HoN) than the Lachish DOM, suggesting that the sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds by DOM is governed by the relative content of these structural substances.																	0273-1223						2006	53	7					51	57		10.2166/wst.2006.207						WOS:000238143200007	16752764

A reverse-phase chromatographic technique was used to compare changes in the DOM hydrophobicity distribution, and a size exclusion chromatographic technique with inline UV-A absorbance, fluorescence, and [DOC] detectors was used to compare changes in the DOM molecular weight distribution. Whereas upon radiolysis major decreases in absorbance and [DOC] were induced and near-total DOC removal was achieved, upon sonolysis there were major decreases in UV/vis absorbance but only minor decreases in [DOC], and a substantial quantity of hydrophilic nonchromophoric material remained in solution. In radiolysis, hydrophilic and hydrophobic DOM solution components were exposed to equal hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) concentrations. However, in sonolysis, hydrophobic DOM components were exposed to more elevated (OH)-O-center dot concentrations than the hydrophilic components and consequently had enhanced rates of degradation. Sonolysis may be of interest in the design of advanced oxidation processes in which the selective elimination of hydrophobic solution components, such as hydrophobic organic contaminants and hydrophobic DOM domains into which they partition, is desired.																	0013-936X					DEC 15	2005	39	24					9732	9737		10.1021/es051416l						WOS:000234133300053	16475360

Total concentrations ranged from 1.13 nmol/L to 7.02 nmol/L for copper and from 3.04 nmol/L to 9.50 nmol/L for nickel. The Cl 8 Sep-Pak solid phase extraction technique was used in order to determine the amount of copper and nickel complexed with the hydrophobic component of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). Up to 32.4% of total copper and 4.57% of total nickel were complexed with the DOM extracted by C18. By applying HPLC analysis it was shown that the majority of the organic compounds retained by C18 had intermediate to low polarity. Using the absorbance ratio a(254/)a(436) it was possible to unravel that humic substances of both terrestrial and marine origin were present in the Thermaikos Gulf and their distribution followed the dilution of riverine waters. Moreover our results indicated that organic binding of both Cu and Ni was stronger with the hydrophobic compounds of terrestrial origin than with those of marine origin. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A batch dialysis system using semipermeable membranes in conjunction with a model lipid phase was used to explore the impact of systematic changes in solution-chemistry on the permeability of four low-molecular weight organic compounds (LMWOCs) of environmental concern: cyclonite, atrazine, naphthalene, and 2,4-dichlorophenol. Similar to previous studies, no correlation could be drawn between molecular weight and contaminant permeability across the membrane for the four LMWOCs. However, contaminant transport was observed to depend on the polarity and hydrophobicity of the LMWOCs. Moreover, the interactions between the organic compounds and DOM varied as a function of solution chemistry (i.e., pH and divalent electrolyte concentration). These results demonstrate considerable variability in the importance and the underlying mechanisms of interactions that may occur between LMWOCs and natural organic matter during membrane separations.

Not all DOM is equally reactive in DBP formation during water disinfection and various physical and chemical fractionation techniques have been applied to identify the major reactive DBP components in DOM. in this review paper, we evaluate three commonly used fractionation techniques used in THM precursor research: XAD fractionation, ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography. Research findings from different source waters worldwide are summarized in order to understand the role of various DOM fractions in THM formation and to identify knowledge gaps. The hydrophobic fraction and the fraction with an apparent molecular weight of 1-10 kDa have been implicated as the primary source of THM precursors, but exceptions have been observed. Differences in isolation procedures, chlorination methodologies, origins of DOM and nomenclature used to describe DOM fractions may contribute to discrepancies in results among some studies. Advancement of fractionation techniques in conjunction with sensitive spectroscopic techniques (e.g. UV absorbance and fluorescence) is essential for effectively evaluating DOM quality and quantity in source waters and optimizing water treatment processes.																	0003-7214					DEC	2005	54	8					475	507								WOS:000234528500001		
J	Brezonik, P; Menken, KD; Bauer, M				Brezonik, P; Menken, KD; Bauer, M			Landsat-based remote sensing of lake water quality characteristics, including chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Ground-based measurements on 15 Minnesota lakes with wide ranges of optical properties and Landsat TM data from the same lakes were used to evaluate the effect of humic color on satellite-inferred water quality conditions. Color (C-440), as measured by absorbance at 440 nm, causes only small biases in estimates of Secchi disk transparency (SDT) from Landsat TM data, except at very high values (> similar to 300 chloroplatinate units, CPU). Similarly, when chlorophyll a (chl a) levels are moderate or high (> 10 pg/L), low-to-moderate levels of humic color have only a small influence on the relationship between SDT and chl a concentration, but it has a pronounced influence at high levels of C-440 (e.g., > similar to 200 CPU). However, deviations from the general chi a-SDT relationship occur at much lower C. values (similar to 60 CPU) when chi a levels are low. Good statistical relationships were found between optical properties of lake water generally associated with algal abundance (SDT, chi a, turbidity) and measured brightness of various Landsat TM bands. The best relationships for chi a (based on R 2 and absence of statistical outliers or lakes with large leverage) were combinations of bands 1, 2, or 4 with the band ratio 1:3 (R-2 = 0.88). Although TM bands 14 individually or as simple ratios were poor predictors of C., multiple regression analyses between ln(C-440) and combinations of bands 1-4 and band ratios yielded several relationships with R-2 > 0.70, suggesting that C-440 can be estimated with fair reliability from Landsat TM data.																	1040-2381					DEC	2005	21	4					373	382								WOS:000235290900001		
J	Shim, S; Kim, B; Hosoi, Y; Masuda, T				Shim, Sooyong; Kim, Bomchul; Hosoi, Yoshihiko; Masuda, Takanori			Export rate of dissolved organic matter from paddy fields during cultivation-activity events	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												The aim of this study is to quantify the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of drainage water from paddy fields in agricultural areas of Tottori prefecture, Japan. In four experimental paddy fields, DOC concentration varied much from 1.1 to 10.1 mg C l(-1), and was the highest during heavy runoff that occurred in April when there was a non-agricultural period. However, variation in DOC concentration did not always correspond to rainfall, but depended more on cultivation-activity events such as tilling, planting, draining in summer, and final draining in autumn. The water discharge rate from each experimental field was estimated by using a hydrologic model (the Tank Model and a genetic algorithm). Daily DOC export rate per unit area of three experimental paddy fields was calculated to be 0.0074, 0.0052, and 0.0081 kg a(-1) day(-1), respectively. The daily DOC export rate showed large seasonal variation with the highest value in May and June. It can be concluded that DOC export from paddy fields can be a substantial source of DOC in receiving waters, and the export rate depends much on cultivation method practice. It might be suggested that DOC export from paddy fields can be controlled by a better water management practice of farmers.																	1611-2490					DEC	2005	3	4					211	218		10.1007/s10333-005-0016-4						WOS:000208365700004		
J	Harrison, JA; Caraco, N; Seitzinger, SP				Harrison, JA; Caraco, N; Seitzinger, SP			Global patterns and sources of dissolved organic matter export to the coastal zone: Results from a spatially explicit, global model	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Here we describe, test, and apply a system of spatially explicit, global models for predicting river export of three dissolved organic matter (DOM) components: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). The DON and DOP models represent the first attempt to model DON and DOP export in a spatially explicit, global manner. DOC, DON, and DOP models explain 88%, 77%, and 91% of the variability in DOC, DON, and DOP yield (kg C, N, or P km(-2) yr(-1)) from validation basins, respectively, and all models are relatively bias free. When applied globally, these models predict that 170 Tg C yr(-1), 10 Tg N yr(-1), and 0.6 Tg P yr(-1) are exported by rivers to the coastal zone as DOC, DON, and DOP, respectively. Because predicted spatial patterns of export for DOC, DON, and DOP are all largely driven by water runoff, geographic distributions of high and low fluxes are fairly consistent across elements, with high fluxes of DOC, DON, and DOP generally predicted for high runoff systems and low fluxes predicted for arid systems. However, there are important regional differences in predicted rates of DOC, DON, and DOP export due to anthropogenic inputs of DON and DOP and wetland influence on DOC.

J	Kishino, M; Tanaka, A; Ishizaka, J				Kishino, M; Tanaka, A; Ishizaka, J			Retrieval of Chlorophyll a, suspended solids, and colored dissolved organic matter in Tokyo Bay using ASTER data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) has three bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) with 15-m spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution has advantages for studying small aquatic areas, such as bay and lakes. Coastal areas are optically characterized by high concentrations of colored suspended matter, various phytoplankton pigments and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The color ratio bio-optical algorithms often used for open sea are very difficult to apply in optically complex coastal water, since it is assumed that the constituents of seawater are mainly phytoplankton pigments. The Neural Network (NN) method, which is one of inverse modeling, has the potential to estimate chlorophyll a, suspended matter and CDOM from remotely sensed data. In the present investigation, we implemented the NN method in the analysis of ASTER data of Tokyo Bay, as a case study in the coastal waters in order to demonstrate the usefulness of remote sensing with high spatial resolution. After validation of the NN using simulated data sets and a field data set observed from a ship, estimation of the concentration of TSS and Chl-a was reasonably accurate. However, in the case of CDOM, the result is not reliable. Disadvantages of the NN method are discussed in this paper. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Andrews Experimental Forest, OR, USA, to address how detrital quality and quantity control soil organic matter accumulation and stabilization. The Detritus Input and Removal Treatments (DIRT) plots consist of treatments that double leaf litter, double woody debris inputs, exclude litter inputs, or remove root inputs via trenching. We measured changes in soil solution chemistry with depth, and conducted long-term incubations of bulk soils from different treatments in order to elucidate effects of detrital inputs on the relative amounts and lability of different soil C pools. In the field, the addition of woody debris increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in O-horizon leachate and at 30 cm, but not at 100 cm, compared to control plots, suggesting increased rates of DOC retention with added woody debris. DOC concentrations decreased through the soil profile in all plots to a greater degree than did dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), most likely due to preferential sorption of high C:N hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in upper horizons; percent hydrophobic DOM decreased significantly with depth, and hydrophilic DOM had a much lower and less variable C:N ratio. Although laboratory extracts of different litter types showed differences in DOM chemistry, percent hydrophobic DOM did not differ among soil solutions from different detrital treatments in the field, suggesting that microbial processing of DOM leachate in the field consumed easily degradable components, thus equalizing leachate chemistry among treatments. Total dissolved N leaching from plots with intact roots was very low (0.17 g m(-2) year(-1)), slightly less than measured deposition to this very unpolluted forest (similar to 0.2 g m(-2) year(-1)). Total dissolved N losses showed significant increases in the two treatments without roots whereas concentrations of DOC decreased. In these plots, N losses were less than half of estimated plant uptake, suggesting that other mechanisms, such as increased microbial immobilization of N, accounted for retention of N in deep soils. In long-term laboratory incubations, soils from plots that had both above- and below-ground litter inputs excluded for 5 years showed a trend towards lower DOC loss rates, but not lower respiration rates. Soils from plots with added wood had similar respiration and DOC loss rates as control soils, suggesting that the additional DOC sorption observed in the field in these soils was stabilized in the soil and not readily lost upon incubation.

Results provided evidence of the different chemical nature of DOM fractions and allowed to distinguish hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions extracted from the same soil substrate.

J	Cory, RM; McKnight, DM				Cory, RM; McKnight, DM			Fluorescence spectroscopy reveals ubiquitous presence of oxidized and reduced quinones in dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Excitation-emission matrixes (EEMs) of 379 dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples from diverse aquatic environments were modeled by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Thirteen components likely representing groups of similarly fluorescing moieties were found to explain the variation in this data set. Seven of the thirteen components were identified as quinone-like based on comparison of their excitation and emission spectra to spectra of model quinones. These quinone-like fluorophores were found to vary in redox state and degree of conjugation. Two components were identified as amino acid-like based on comparison to tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence spectra. The other four components are not yet associated with any class of molecules. The quinone-like fluorophores account for about 50% of the fluorescence for every sample analyzed, showing that quinone-like fluorophores are an important and ubiquitous fluorescing moiety and in natural waters. Further, the distribution of the quinone-like fluorophores was evaluated as a function of environmental and laboratory redox gradients. Under reducing conditions, the contribution of the reduced quinone-like fluorophores increased concurrent with a decrease in the oxidized quinone-like fluorophores, indicating that DOM fluorescence is a function of redox state of quinone-like moieties. Lastly, a ratio of two quinone-like fluorophores was found to explain the variation in the fluorescence index. These results provide new insight into the redox reactivity of DOM and have implications for the application of fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to characterize DOM.

J	Baker, A				Baker, A			Thermal fluorescence quenching properties of dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												The fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are investigated between 10 and 45 degrees C for river and waste waters and organic matter standards. With increased temperature, fluorescence intensity is quenched. It is demonstrated that for a range or river and wastewater samples, that tryptophan-like fluorescence exhibits a greater range of quenching (between 20 +/- 4% and 35 +/- 5%) than fulvic-like fluorescence (19 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 3%) over this temperature range. Humic Substance standards exhibit similar fulvic-like (23 +/- 4%) fluorescence thermal quenching properties to river water samples (23 +/- 3%); however none of the samples exhibit quenching of tryptophan-like fluorescence to the same extent as the tryptophan standards (similar to 50%). Thermal fluorescence quenching is related to the exposure of the fluorophores to the heat source; our findings suggest that the tryptophan-like groups within DOM is more exposed in untreated wastewaters than in treated wastewaters riverine DOM. Thermal fluorescence properties have the potential to be used to source DOM, to provide additional chemical structural information, to temperature correct laser-induced remotely sensed DOM fluorescence, and to characterise DOM through the wastewater treatment process.

J	Thacker, SA; Tipping, E; Baker, A; Gondar, D				Thacker, SA; Tipping, E; Baker, A; Gondar, D			Development and application of functional assays for freshwater dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												A series of 11 standardised, reproducible, assays have been developed of physico-chemical functions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwaters. The assays provide quantitative information on light absorption, fluorescence, photochemical fading, pH buffering, copper binding, benzo(a)pyrene binding, hydrophilicity and adsorption to alumina. To obtain DOM for the assays, a 45 L sample of filtered freshwater was rotary-evaporated to reduce the volume to ca. 500 cm(3). The concentrate was then passed through a strong cation exchanger, in the Na+ form, to remove alkaline-earth cations, and then through 0.7 and 0.2 pm filters. Eight samples, two each from a lake and three streamwaters, were processed. The yields of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 70% to 107% (average 91%). The samples of DOM, stored in the dark at 4 degrees C, retained their functional assay characteristics for up to 7 months. When assaying the concentrates, parallel assays were performed with Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), as a quality control standard. For most of the assays, the results for eight freshwater DOM samples are similar to those obtained with SRFA, the chief exception being the greater hydrophilicity of the DOM samples. For eight of the assays, variability among the DOM samples is significantly (p < 0.01) greater than can be explained by analytical error, i.e. by comparison with results for the SRFA quality standard; the three exceptional assays are photochemical fading, copper binding and benzo(a)pyrene binding. The two lakewater samples studied gave the most extreme assay results, probably because of the influence of phytoplankton-derived DOM. Significant correlations of hydrophilicity and adsorption with optical absorbance may mean that some DOM functional properties can be predicted from comparatively simple measurements.

A characterisation of DOM was carried out to assess the stability of the compost generated during the thermophilic and aerobic biodegradation of faeces. In addition, levels of soluble microbial products generated in the bio-toilet composting reactor were compared with those taken from other sources. The results showed that (i) the main component of DOM from the bio-toilet are solutes with molecular weight (MW)> 30,000 Da (40%), whereas micromolecules (MW < 1000 Da) constituted more than 60% of the DOM from other solid samples, while liquid samples reached even more than 90%; (ii) the DOM stabilisation level in the composting reactor of the bio-toilet system was greater than that shown by DOM from other sources, (iii) stabilisation of DOM in the bio-toilet system was characterised by an increasing amount of macromolecules (MW > 30,000 Da) after a decreasing trend was observed in the early stages of the biodegradation process; and (iv) net production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in wastewater treatment plants is greater than in the bio-toilet.

However, ocean color is not a function of chlorophyll alone. We assess differences between two ocean color models with nearly identical validation statistics. The resulting chlorophyll retrievals show systematic differences which are consistent with each model's ability to account for the absorption of light by colored dissolved organic materials. These differences are often large and approach 100% poleward of 40 degrees latitude. We conclude that the discrepancies are due to fundamental differences in model assumptions and their empirical tuning using geographically limited, in situ data. This source of uncertainty is important as the choice of ocean color model alters modeled rates of global net primary production by more than 30%. The ultimate resolution of this issue requires continued improvements in remote sensing algorithms and validation data as well as satellite technology.

J	Hong, HS; Wu, JY; Shang, SL; Hu, CM				Hong, HS; Wu, JY; Shang, SL; Hu, CM			Absorption and fluorescence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Pearl River Estuary, South China	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The Pearl River is a complex river network under the influence of heavy urbanization and industrialization. The Pearl River Estuary receives freshwater from eight major sources, each containing various pollutants. The spectral absorption and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Pearl River Estuary were studied during November 2002, a low flow (dry) season. Over a salinity range of 33-0, CDOM absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(355)) ranged from 0.24 to 1.93 m(-1), lower than several other American and European estuaries. In contrast to the wet season, conservative mixing was evidenced by a linear, inverse relationship between a(355) and salinity. CDOM, primarily of terrestrial origin, contained more anthropogenic organic matter than natural plant decay matter: tryptophan-like fluorophore T had the strongest signal among all fluorophores for the entire study region. The absorption spectral slope (S), determined between 300 and 500 nm, ranged between 0.0138 and 0.0184 nm(-1) and did not show distinguishable patterns except in the transition zone between the estuary and the South China Sea. The relative composition of fluorophores was found to vary among different sources. This result demonstrated the potential for using fluorophores to characterize the composition of CDOM and trace pollutants to their various freshwater sources. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Bioassays with oilseed rape showed that HoDOM in culture solution lowered the effective dose 50 of triflusulfuron methyl by up to 4.8 times. Equilibrium dialysis experiments showed that in aqueous solution triflusulfuron methyl was adsorbed to HoDOM (K-OC of 446.5 mL g(-1)). The half-life in water (pH 7.0) was increased from 52 to 76 days in the presence of HoDOM, but this cannot completely explain its phytotoxicity, as bioassays lasted for 21 days only. On the other hand, the addition of HoDOM to soils did not change the degradative behavior of triflusulfuron methyl. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis showed that HoDOM in soil did not significantly influence soil microbial activity, which may explain the above result on degradation in soil. Furthermore, in batch equilibrium experiments on soil, triflusulfuron methyl was only weakly adsorbed and the presence of HoDOM significantly modified the isotherm form. Results suggest that although the addition of exogenous HoDOM from MWC to soil did not influence the herbicide's persistence, its enhanced mobility could be of environmental concern and may deserve further research.

The sorption of TCBP was lower and reached steady value more slowly than did BaP. Tenax extraction revealed at least two differently desorbing fractions for both model compounds, which also supported the conclusion that DOM-HOC associations may involve several mechanisms. The rapidly desorbing fraction may be attributed to freely dissolved and loosely sorbed compound, whereas the more strongly sorbed fraction may indicate the presence of specific binding sites. The data indicated that the association between hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOC) and DOM is not simply absorption that is solely driven by the lipophilicity of the sorbates. Although contact time had a rather negligible effect on the sorption of BaP, the proportion of desorption resistant fraction increased with time, whereas the desorption of TCBP was less affected by contact time. Steric factors may be the cause of the lower sorption and smaller desorption resistant fraction of TCBP. The results indicate potential differences in the behavior of PAHs and PCBs in the aquatic environment.																	0013-936X					OCT 1	2005	39	19					7529	7534		10.1021/es050835f						WOS:000232410000034	16245824	
J	Branco, AB; Kremer, JN				Branco, AB; Kremer, JN			The relative importance of chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to the prediction of the diffuse attenuation coefficient in shallow estuaries	ESTUARIES												The availability of underwater tight is a critical factor in the growth and abundance of primary producers in shallow embayments. The goal of this study was to examine the relative importance of factors influencing tight availability in this type of water body. Many simulation models of aquatic ecosystems predict tight attenuation from chlorophyll or phytoplankton stock. In the three southern New England sites studied here, no useful relationship was found to exist between chlorophyll and K-PAR (the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation; Kirk 1994; Mobley 1994). In 40 of 53 cases, a regression of chlorophyll versus K-PAR was not statisticatly significant. Variation in K-PAR did demonstrate a correlation to salinity, implicating a freshwater source of light attenuating material. This was true even in a system with little freshwater inflow. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one such terrestrial input that enters estuaries from their watersheds and can strongly influence the availability of light to aquatic primary producers. This study demonstrated that over 70% of the variability in the K-PAR coefficient can be attributed to CDOM in the shallow estuaries studied. This illustrates the need for improved model formulations that include CDOM in the prediction of light attenuation in shallow coastal systems. A new equation has been developed to predict K-PAR with CDOM.																	0160-8347					OCT	2005	28	5					643	652		10.1007/BF02732903						WOS:000233418600001

A 40-km long transect was conducted in the northern Baltic Sea in March 2003, following a freshwater plume from its source into the fully mixed open-sea area. The spreading of river outflow below the ice resulted in a well-stratified low-salinity surface layer further out than normally occurs in the open-water period. The freshwaters were high in dissolved organic matter (DOC, DON and CDOM), and inorganic nutrients (ammonium, nitrate and silicate), although the levels of phosphate were low. In general these parameters changed concurrently with salinity in such a way that mixing was conservative. The characteristics of the ice varied from the freshwater source to the open water, with increasing salinity and brine volumes (porosity) occurring in the more open-sea stations. Coinciding with the changes in ice properties there was an increase in sea-ice algal growth in the more marine stations along the transect. Biological activity in the ice was largely confined to bottom ice assemblages. In contrast to the conditions in the underlying water, no relationship between salinity, inorganic nutrients and organic matter was observed in the ice. In particular ammonium, phosphate, DOC and DON were present in excess of those levels predicted from the dilution curves, indicating the presence of considerable DOM production by ice assemblages, inorganic nutrient uptake and remineralization within the ice.

Jar-test experiments were first conducted with a reconstituted water containing either synthetic or natural extracts of humic substances, and then with a raw water from Moselle River (France). The characterization of the freeze-dried coagulated sediment by EELS in the 250-450 eV range, showed that Fe-coagulant species predominantly associate with the carboxylic groups of organic matter, and that this interaction is accompanied by a release of previously complexed calcium ions. The variation of Fe/C elemental ratio with iron concentration provides insightful information into the coagulation mechanism of humic substances. At acid pH, Fe/C remains close to 3 over the whole range of iron concentrations investigated, while a much lower atomic ratio is expected from the value of optimal coagulant dosage. This suggests that a charge neutralization/complexation mechanism is responsible for the removal of humic colloids, the aggregates being formed with both iron-coagulated and proton-neutralized organic compounds. At pH 8, the decrease in Fe/C around optimal coagulant concentration is interpreted as a bridging of stretched humic macromolecules by Fehydrolyzed species. Aggregation would then result from a competition between reconformation of humic chains around coagulant species and collision of destabilized humic material. EELS also enabled a fingerpriting of natural organic substances contained in the iron-coagulated surface water, N/C elemental analyses revealing that humic colloids are removed prior to proteinic compounds.

Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 8.75 to 20.19 mg L-1 with an average of (13.10 +/- 3.51) mg L-1. CDOM absorption coefficients a(lambda) at 280 nm, 355 nm, and 440 nm were in the range 11.28...33.46 m(-1) (average (20.95 +/- 5.52) m(-1)), 2.42...7.90 m(-1) (average (4.92 +/- 1.29) m(-1)), and 0.65...2.44 m(-1) (average (1.46 +/- 0.44) m(-1)), respectively. In general, CDOM absorption coefficient and DOC concentration were found to decrease away from the river inflow to Meiliang Bay towards the lake center. The values of the DOC-specific absorption coefficients a*(lambda), given as absorption coefficient related to mass concentration of organic carbon (C) ranged from 0.28 to 0.47 L mg(-1) m(-1) at 355 nm. The determination coefficients between CDOM absorption and DOC concentration decreased with the increase of wavelength from 280 to 550 nm. The linear regression relationship between CDOM absorption at 280 nm and DOC concentration was following: a(280 nm) = 1.507 L mg(-1) m(-1) (.) DOC + 1.215 m(-1). The spectral slope S values were dependent on the wavelength range used in the regression. The estimated S values decreased with increasing wavelength range used. A significant negative linear relationship was found between CDOM absorption coefficients, DOC-specific absorption coefficients and estimated S values especially in longer wavelength range. The linear regression relationship between DOC-specific absorption coefficients at 440 nm and estimated S values during the wavelength range from 280 to 500 nm was following: a*(440 nm) = (-0.021 mu m (.) S + 0.424) L mg(-1) m(-1).				Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012													0323-4320					SEP	2005	33	4					315	323		10.1002/aheh.200400585						WOS:000233064500003

In the irradiated seawater samples, Fe(II) steady-state concentrations ([Fe(II)](ss)), both as percentage of total dissolved iron and normalized to 1 mg C L-1, were higher in the low-molecular-weight (LMW) than in the high-molecular-weight (HMW) DOM fractions, despite higher net rates of H2O2 formation in the HMW DOM fractions. Also in the samples from Murtensee, [Fe(II)](ss), both as percentage of total dissolved iron and normalized to the decadic absorption coefficient at 350 nm (alpha(350), unit m(-1)), were higher in the LMW than in the HMW DOM fractions. Unlike in the seawater samples, however, net rates of H2O2 production, normalized to alpha(350), were higher in the LMW DOM fractions, as compared to the HMW DOM fractions, indicating a higher efficiency of O-2(center dot-) formation with these LMW compounds from Murtensee. Based on the simulation of experimental data with mathematical kinetic modeling, we hypothesize that Fe(II) is formed through photolysis of Fe(III) complexes in the LMW DOM fractions from the Strait of Gibraltar and from Murtensee and that Fe(II) is stabilized by a ligand in the water samples from Murtensee. In the irradiated HMW DOM fractions from the "river-to-ocean" system, [Fe(II)](ss), normalized to alpha(350), were generally higher in the water samples from the Rivers Scheldt and Rhine than in the water samples from their estuaries, suggesting that terrestrially derived DOM has a higher photochemical reactivity towards Fe(II) formation than autochthonous DOM.																	1015-1621					SEP	2005	67	3					292	307		10.1007/s00027-005-0779-0						WOS:000232030000007

The hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of DOM were isolated using XAD-7HP resin, and then the THM formation potential with the chlorination of these fractions was examined. Hydrophobic acids, such as humic substances, were 30 similar to 60% of DOC in Yodo rivers and about 25% in the northern basin of Lake Biwa. The contribution of hydrophobic acids, such as humic substances, to the THM formation potential was about 70% in Yodo rivers, while it was about 30% in the northern basin of Lake Biwa, which was almost same as the contribution of hydrophilic DOM to THM formation potential. Hydrophilic neutral DOM was 15 similar to 20% of DOC in Lake Biwa, and its contribution of THM formation potential was about 40%, which was larger than those of hydrophobic acids and hydrophilic DOM. The THM formation potential per organic carbon unit of hydrophilic fractions in the northern basin of Lake Biwa were two-times that in rivers. These results suggest that the kinds of hydrophilic DOM in Lake Biwa may be different from those in rivers.																	0525-1931					SEP	2005	54	9					923	928		10.2116/bunsekikagaku.54.923						WOS:000232125700027

On the basis of solubility in alkaline, organic matter was concluded to compose of humic substances in two (S1 and S3) and of humin (S2) in one of the sediments. DOM in the samples was quantified by total organic carbon measurement. Specific UV-absorption (SUVA) and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) analyses were used to characterize DOM. Sorption of pyrene was used as a measure for functionality of DOM. Both water extraction and centrifugation speed were shown to affect the properties of DOM; however, the effects were sediment dependent. Water extraction increased the amount of DOM separated from the two sediments that had humic character (S1 and S3). In most cases water extraction increased SUVA and shifted the molecular size distribution of DOM towards larger sizes. The separation procedure had also an effect on the functionality of DOM. In water extracted samples of S2 and S3 the sorption of pyrene was higher than in the corresponding samples separated without water extraction, whereas in SI similar effect was not found. Generally, centrifugation speed had smaller effects on the properties of DOM than water extraction. The fact that the effects of separation procedure on DOM depend on the sediment characteristics complicates the comparison between samples and evaluation of functionality in field conditions.

Satellite remote sensing has the potential to resolve this problem. We carried out model simulations to evaluate the suitability of different satellite sensors (Landsat, IKONOS, and the Advanced land Imager [ALI]) to map the amount of CDOM in concentration ranges that occur in boreal lakes of the Nordic countries. The results showed that the 8-bit radiometric resolution of Landsat 7 is not adequate when absorption by CDOM at 420 nm is higher than 3 m(-1). On the other hand, the 16-bit radiometric resolution of ALI, a prototype of the next generation of Landsat, is suitable for mapping CDOM in a wider range of concentrations. An ALI image of southern Finland was acquired on 14, July 2002 and in situ measurements were carried out in 15 lakes (18 stations). The results showed that there is a high correlation (R(2) = 0.84) between the 565 nm/660 nm ALI band ratio and the CDOM absorption coefficient in lakes. Analysis of 245 lakes in the acquired satellite image showed a normal distribution of CDOM concentration among the lakes. However, the size distribution of lakes was highly skewed toward small lakes, resulting in the CDOM concentration per unit lake area being skewed toward high values. We showed that remote sensing enables synoptic monitoring of the CDOM concentration in a large number of lakes and thus enables scaling up to the level of large ecosystems and biomes.

Upon introduction SeO32- to FeS2-containing samples, adsorption of SeO32- occurred at the FeS2 surface, and led to a reduction and precipitation of a Se-o solid phase with a solubility of 3 X 10(-9) M (after 60 days). In the presence of humic substances, an association of Se with these humic substances was observed and the 3 X 10(-9) M solubility limit was not reached in the same time delay. Upon introduction of SeO32 to Boom clay suspensions (equilibration up to 9 months), the initial adsorption of SeO32- on the solid phase was increased with respect to systems containing only FeS2, due to the presence of (illite) clay minerals. This competing adsorption process. and the presence of humic substances, again decreased the kinetics of reduction with respect to FeS2 samples. Also, an association of Se with Boom clay humic substances was observed, and amounted up to similar to 10(-7) M in some samples after 9 months equilibration. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mesquita, ME; Carranca, C				Mesquita, ME; Carranca, C			Effect of dissolved organic matter on copper zinc competitive adsorption by a sandy soil at different pH values	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												The effect of dissolved organic carbon from sewage sludge on copper and zinc adsorption and interaction on samples from the surface layer (0 - 10 cm) of a sandy soil (Gleyic Podzol) were studied at two pH levels (4 and 7). This soil presented acidification hazards and sewage sludge with a high content of Cu and Zn was used as a fertilizer. Soil samples were treated by solutions of Cu and Zn as nitrate salts with concentration levels up to 30 mg l(-1) in a Ca(NO3), background at a constant level (180 mg l(-1)) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Copper and zinc sorption capacity decreased in the presence of DOC. As the pH increased, the decrease in Cu adsorption due to interaction with DOC was more obvious. Conversely, without addition of DOC, Cu and Zn adsorption increased with pH. More Cu than Zn was adsorbed. Soil sorption of these cations was described by equilibrium isotherms that fitted both Langmuir and Freundlich type equations, presenting however a better fit to the Freundlich equation (R-2>98%). Adsorption dependence on DOC was more noticeable at pH 7.

Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 2.7 to 10.1 mg/L with an average of 5.65 +/- 1.70 mg/L. All spectra of CDOM had a common shape with maximal absorption in shorter wavelength and minimal absorption in longer wavelength. CDOM absorption coefficients at 280 nm and 355 nm were in the range 3.52-24.22 m(-1) (aver. age 8.69 +/- 4.76 m(-1)) and 0.53-8.08 m(-1) (average 2.03 +/- 1.65 m(-1)), respectively. The values of the DOC-specific absorption coefficient at 355 nm ranged from 0.09 to 0.80 L(mg org.C)(-1) m(-1). The exponential slope coefficient ranged from 0.015 to 0.023 nm(-1) with a mean value 0.020 +/- 0.002 nm(-1) over the 280-400 nm interval. Fluorescence emission at 450 nm, excited at 355 rim, had a mean value of 0.86 nm(-1). CDOM fluorescence and absorption, were significantly and positively correlated. The coefficient of variation between CDOM absorption and DOC concentration decreased with the increase of wavelength from 280 to 800 nm. The CDOM absorption measurements are of use to study regional distribution of CDOM, contribution of CDOM to light attenuation, and development of regional models for the optical properties of CDOM which allow higher precision in remote sensing applications of water quality monitoring.

Fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis was applied to study the dynamics of autochthonous DOM. Seven independent fluorescent fractions were identified, differing in their spectral characteristics, production rates, and sensitivity to photochemical and microbial degradation processes. Five different humic fractions, a marine protein, and a peptide fluorescence were found. The five humic fractions were produced microbially, with the greatest production occurring under combined Si- and P-limiting conditions. The two proteinaceous fractions were produced during exponential growth of phytoplankton, irrespective of biomass composition. Photodegradation was an important sink for the microbially derived humic material, and the marine protein material was susceptible to both photo-and microbial degradation.

J	Simjouw, JP; Minor, EC; Mopper, K				Simjouw, JP; Minor, EC; Mopper, K			Isolation and characterization of estuarine dissolved organic matter: Comparison of ultrafiltration and C-18 solid-phase extraction techniques	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from aquatic environments has always been constrained by the ability to obtain a representative fraction of the DOM pool for analysis. Ultrafiltration or extraction, commonly using XAD or C-18 sorbents, is therefore generally used to concentrate and desalt DOM samples for further analyses. In this study, we compared ultrafiltration and Cis solid-phase extraction disks (SPE) as DOM isolation methods for estuarine samples. We also evaluated the use of the C-18 SPE disks to isolate low-molecular-weight DOM (LMW-DOM) in the filtrate from ultrafiltration. The isolates from both methods and the LMW-DOM C-18-extracts were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS). Based on mass balance and blank measurements, we found that the Cis SPE disks can be used to isolate bulk DOM and LMW-DOM from estuarine samples. FTIR and DT-MS analysis show that C I g-extracted DOM and ultrafiltered high-molecular-weight DOM (HMW-DOM) differ markedly in chemical composition. The HMW-DOM is enriched in (degraded) polysaccharides along with aminosugars when compared with the C-18-extracted DOM. The C-18-extracted DOM appears enriched in aromatic compounds, probably from lignin and/or aromatic amino acids in proteins. C-18 SPE of LMW-DOM samples from ultrafiltration increases the recovery of DOM from the total sample up to about 70%, compared to around 50% using ultrafiltration alone. Thus, a majority of the DOM can be isolated from estuarine samples by a combination of these techniques. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra and UV-visible absorption spectra of CDOM are reported as a function of salinity. Samples from different locations and over different seasons were collected during four cruises in 2002 and 2003 in the Baltic Sea in both Pomeranian Bay and the Gulf of Gdansk. Absorption by CDOM decreased with increased distance from the riverine source and reached a relatively stable absorption background in the open sea. Regression analysis showed that fluorescence intensity was linearly related to absorption by CDOM at 375 nm and a(CDOM)(375) absorption coefficients were inversely related to salinity. Analysis of CDOM-EEM spectra indicated that a change in composition of CDOM occurred along the salinity gradient in the Baltic-Sea. Analysis of percent contribution of respective fluorophore groups to the total intensity of EEM spectra indicated that the fluorescence peaks associated with terrestrial humic components of the CDOM and total integrated fluorescence decreased with decreasing CDOM absorption. In contrast, the protein-like fraction of CDOM decreased to a lesser degree than the others. Analysis of the percent contribution of fluorescence peak intensities to the total fluorescence along the salinity gradient showed that the contribution of protein-like fluorophores increased from 2.6% to 5.1% in the high-salinity region of the transect. Fluorescence and absorption changes observed in the Baltic Sea were similar to those observed in similar transects that have been sampled elsewhere, e.g. in European estuaries, Gulf of Mexico, Mid-Atlantic Bight and the Cape Fear River plume in the South Atlantic Bight, although the changes in the Baltic Sea occurTed over a much smaller salinity gradient.

Despite this wide range and the potential effects on carbon fluxes and food p webs, the knowledge on how the environment and phytoplankton species involved influence this process is incomplete. Notably, there are no estimates for release of dissolved organic carbon by Prochlorococcus, a marine cyanobacterium estimated to be the numerically dominant oxygenic phototroph in the oceans. Here we report extracellular release of dissolved organic compounds from two axenic Prochlorococcus strains representing different ecotypes (MED4 and MIT9312) cultured under nutrient replete and phosphorus limited conditions. Independent assays based on C-14-bicarbonate tracers and analyses of particulate and dissolved organic carbon suggest that the release of dissolved organic carbon ranged from 9 to 24% of the total assimilated inorganic carbon with slightly lower values for phosphorus limited cultures. Between 4 and 20% of the released organic matter consisted of low molecular weight carboxylic acids, compounds known to be highly labile substrates for heterotrophic bacteria. In oligotrophic oceans where Prochlorococcus is a dominant contributor to primary production and input of terrigenous organic matter is negligible, this process is likely a significant contributor to the pool of organic substrates available for microbial heterotrophs.																	0240-8759					SEP-DEC	2005	55	3-4					225	231								WOS:000235757200007

The water was characterized before and after the adsorption step using UV/VIS spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with diode array detection (DAD). DOM breakthrough of GAC filters has been found to be slower at higher water temperatures, the DOM removal being most effective at 35 degrees C. UV/VIS spectra and SEC chromatograms of water samples treated at different water temperatures indicate that an increase in temperature especially supports the adsorption of small DOM molecules as well as molecules absorbing at higher wavelengths, specifying aromatic structures of DOM. SEC-DAD has been demonstrated to be an efficient method for characterizing DOM of natural waters and for detecting relative changes of DOM during the water treatment process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gardner, GB; Chen, RF; Berry, A				Gardner, GB; Chen, RF; Berry, A			High-resolution measurements of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Neponset River Estuary, Boston Harbor, MA	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The Neponset River Estuary is a small, tidally dominated urban system that is fringed with Spartina spp. salt marsh and drains the second largest river into Boston Harbor, MA, High-resolution measurements of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were taken with a towed instrument package, the MiniShuttle, to explore tidal and seasonal variations in the sources and distributions of CDOM in the estuary. A mid-estuary source of CDOM was apparent on all surveys representing 10-50% of the freshwater CDOM source to the system. Presumably this source results from the degradation of salt marsh derived organic matter within the estuary. The strength of this source peaked in late summer, an observation that is consistent with this interpretation. Two-dimensional (tow-yo) data shows that the constricting Granite Avenue Bridge displays a major influence on circulation in the estuary. Further, large-scale tidal mixing and variations in the freshwater endmember on the time scale of hours make interpretations difficult. High-resolution measurements show that a fluctuating freshwater endmember and a constant CDOM source from the fringing salt marsh during August, 2002 are consistent with observations.

J	Sutton, R; Sposito, G; Diallo, MS; Schulten, HR				Sutton, R; Sposito, G; Diallo, MS; Schulten, HR			Molecular simulation of a model of dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												A series of atomistic simulations was performed to assess the ability of the Schulten dissolved organic matter (DOM) molecule, a well-established model humic molecule, to reproduce the physical and chemical behavior of natural humic substances. The unhydrated DOM molecule had a bulk density value appropriate to humic matter, but its Hildebrand solubility parameter was lower than the range of current experimental estimates. Under hydrated conditions, the DOM molecule went through conformational adjustments that resulted in disruption of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), although few water molecules penetrated the organic interior. The radius of gyration of the hydrated DOM molecule was similar to those measured for aquatic humic substances. To simulate humic materials under aqueous conditions with varying pH levels, carboxyl groups were deprotonated, and hydrated Na(+) or Ca(2+) were added to balance the resulting negative charge. Because of intrusion of the cation hydrates, the model metal-humic structures were more porous, had greater solvent-accessible surface areas, and formed more H-bonds with water than the protonated, hydrated DOM molecule. Relative to Na(+), Ca(2+) was both more strongly bound to carboxylate groups and more fully hydrated. This difference was attributed to the higher charge of the divalent cation. The Ca-DOM hydrate, however, featured fewer H-bonds than the Na-DOM hydrate, perhaps because of the reduced orientational freedom of organic moieties and water molecules imposed by Ca(2+). The present work is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous computational exploration regarding the behavior of a model humic molecule under a range of physical conditions typical of soil and water systems.

In autumn-winter, chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) near the euphotic zone remained very low (< 1.0 mg m(-3)) but markedly increased in spring (16.8 mg m(-3)). Chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient for phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) was high during summer and low during the spring bloom. This is because the package effect was greater during the spring bloom due to the presence of large diatoms, while small phytoplankton dominated during summer. Absorption at 440 nm by CDOM was higher than that of phytoplankton and detritus, except during the spring bloom, and the relative contribution of CDOM absorption to the total absorption coefficient was > 50%. CDOM and detritus absorption did not increase with increasing Chl a, but it showed a time lag between the spring bloom. It is suggested that phytoplankton degradation started after the spring bloom; detritus absorption increased and, then, CDOM absorption increased. River runoff was not a significant influence in Funka Bay, therefore, CDOM production may be mainly related to microbial activity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jansen, B; Nierop, KGJ; Verstraten, JM				Jansen, B; Nierop, KGJ; Verstraten, JM			Mechanisms controlling the mobility of dissolved organic matter, aluminium and iron in podzol B horizons	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												The processes governing the (im)mobilization of Al, Fe and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in podzols are still subject to debate. In this study we investigated the mechanisms of (im)mobilization of Al, Fe and organic matter in the upper and lower B horizons of two podzols from the Netherlands that are in different stages of development. We equilibrated batches of soil material from each horizon with DOM solutions obtained from the Oh horizon of the corresponding soil profiles. We determined the amount of (im)mobilized Al, Fe and DOM after addition of Al and Fe at pH 4.0 and 4.5 and initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of 10 mg C litre(-1) or 30 mg C litre(-1), respectively. At the combination of pH and DOC concentrations most realistic for the field situation, organic matter was retained in all horizons, the most being retained in the lower B horizon of the well-developed soil and the least in the upper B horizon of the younger profile. Organic matter solubility seemed to be controlled mainly by precipitation as organo-metal complexes and/or by adsorption on freshly precipitated solid Al- and Fe-phases. In the lower B horizons, at pH 4.5, solubility of Al and Fe appeared to be controlled mainly by the equilibrium with secondary solid Al- and Fe-phases. In the upper B horizons, the solubility of Al was controlled by adsorption processes, while Fe still precipitated as inorganic complexes as well as organic complexes in spite of the prevailing more acidic pH. Combined with a previous study of eluvial horizons from the same profiles, the results confirm the important role of organic matter in the transport of Al and Fe to create illuvial B horizons initially and subsequently deepening and differentiating them into Bh and Bs horizons.

J	Kaiser, K; Guggenberger, G				Kaiser, K; Guggenberger, G			Storm flow flushing in a structured soil changes the composition of dissolved organic matter leached into the subsoil	GEODERMA					9th Meeting of the Nordic-Chapter-of-the-International-Humic-Substances-Society	MAY 19-21, 2003	Mid Sweden Univ, Sundswall, SWEDEN	Int Hum Substances Soc	Mid Sweden Univ			Dissolved organic matter increases typically in streams draining forested catchments during heavy rainstorms and snowmelt. Tracer methods and model calculations suggest that the storm flow flushing of dissolved organic matter is either due to lateral near-surface flow, i.e. within the organic forest floor, or preferential flow (tunnelling) through the mineral soil. Both pathways should deliver forest floor-derived dissolved organic matter to streams that is hardly changed because of little to no interaction with mineral soil material and microorganisms. Here, we investigated the effect of rain storm induced vertical flushing through the mineral soil on the composition of dissolved organic matter in a structured Rendzie Leptosols under 90-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). During two rainstorm periods in autumn 1998 with elevated transport of organic C, N, P and S from the forest floor into the subsoil, we sampled dissolved organic matter in forest floor leachates (sampled by zero-tension plate lysimeters), subsoil solutions (sampled by suction cups at 90 cm depth) and subsoil seepage (sampled by zero-tension plate lysimeters at 90 cm depth). The chemical composition of dissolved organic matter was characterised by fractionation with XAD-8 macroreticular resin, wet-chemical analyses of carbohydrates and lignin-derived phenols, and deten-nination of the delta(13)C. During both rainstorm periods, all tested chemical features of dissolved organic matter in forest floor leachate and subsoil seepage matched each other greatly. In contrast, dissolved organic matter in soil solution contained smaller portions of XAD-8-adsorbable organic C, less lignin-derived phenols, more carbohydrates and showed smaller delta(13)C values than that in forest floor leachates and subsoil seepage. These results suggest a rather direct transfer of organic solutes from the forest floor into the subsoil and probably further to ground and surface waters during heavy rainstorms. Dissolved organic matter leaving the soil in heavy rainstorms by rapid water flow through macropores is likely less biodegradable, more UV-digestible and more reactive towards metals and organic pollutants than that released from soil at low rainfall intensity by matric flow.

J	Tipping, E				Tipping, E			Modelling A1 competition for heavy metal binding by dissolved organic matter in soil and surface waters of acid and neutral pH	GEODERMA					9th Meeting of the Nordic-Chapter-of-the-International-Humic-Substances-Society	MAY 19-21, 2003	Mid Sweden Univ, Sundswall, SWEDEN	Int Hum Substances Soc	Mid Sweden Univ			Published field data on the activity of Al3+ (a(Al)(3+)) in temperate soil and surface waters of pH 3.3-7.1 have been assembled, and empirical equations describing the dependence Of log a(Al3+) on pH derived. For soils, two equations are necessary, one describing mineral, or high-Al, soils and the other low-Al soils. In each case, the data at higher pH (> 5.5 or 6) can be described 3 with a limiting relationship in which a(Al3+) /aH(+)(3) was constant, while at lower pH the a(H+) exponent is smaller, 1.02 for low-Al soils and 1.59 for high-Al soils. The majority of data for surface waters can be represented by a single equation, involving either 3 a limiting a(Al3+)/a(H+)(3) value, or a quadratic expression. Exceptions are acid bog waters, which have appreciably lower values of a(Al3+) than other waters. For each equation, estimates of uncertainty are derived. The equations have been used to estimate competition by Al3+ and AlOH2+ for the binding of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb) by dissolved fulvic acid (FA) under natural conditions, also taking into account competition by Ca and Fe(III) species. The simulations suggest that Al significantly decreases the extents of organic complexation of all three metals, but that the concentrations of Cu2+ and Ph2+ are substantially more sensitive to competition than is the concentration of Zn2+.

DOC concentration was low (mean 37 +/- 19 mu MC) in the upstream waters, whereas, in general, it increased toward the downstream areas (mean 92 +/- 47 mu M C). Significant variations in DOC concentration were detected among rivers and channels. DOC concentration in the epilimnion of Lake Biwa increased during the summer period and decreased during the winter period. The lake hypolimnion has lower DOC concentration (mean 87 +/- 7 mu M C) compared with the epilimnion (107 +/- 15 pM C). Fulvic acid (FA)-like substances in the DOM were directly characterized by 3-D EEM. The fluorescence peak for upstream DOM was found in regions with longer wavelengths (excitation/emission 386 +/- 6/476 +/- 5 nm) compared with downstream and lake DOM (351 +/- 12/446 +/- 15 nm and 341 +/- 6/434 6 nm, respectively). The DOC concentration is correlated with fluorescence peak intensity of FA-like substances in DOM in river waters. Such a relationship was not found in lake DOM. A blueshift of the fluorescence peak from upstream to lake DOM was observed. A decrease in fluorescence intensities was also detected during the summer period. These results may suggest that the degradation of FA-like substances in DOM occurs from natural solar irradiation. Protein-like fluorescence was significantly detected in the take epilimnion during the summer period. A linear relationship between DOC concentration and protein-like fluorescence indicated that an autochthonous input of DOM gave rise to the increase in DOC concentration in the lake epilimnion during the summer. These results may suggest that the 3-D EEM can be used as a tool for the investigation of DOM dynamics at the watershed level with concurrent measurement of DOC concentration and the fluorescence properties of fulvic acid-like and protein-like substances.																	1439-8621					AUG	2005	6	2					101	115		10.1007/s1201-005-0149-6						WOS:000231200000005		
J	Yang, H; Wu, X; Zhou, LX; Yang, ZM				Yang, H; Wu, X; Zhou, LX; Yang, ZM			Effect of dissolved organic matter on chlorotoluron sorption and desorption in soils	PEDOSPHERE												A batch equilibrium techniques was used to examine the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from both non-treated sludge (NTS) and heat-expanded sludge (HES) on the sorption and desorption of chlorotoluron (3-(3-chloro-p-tolyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) in two types of soils, a yellow fluvo-aquic and a red soil from China. Without DOM, sorption of chlorotoluron was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the red soil than in the yellow fluvo-aquic soil. However, with DOM the effect was dependent on the soil type and nature of DOM. Chlorotoluron sorption was lower in the yellow fluvo-aquic soil than in the red soil, suggesting that with the same DOM levels the yellow fluvo-aquic soil had a lower sorption capacity for this herbicide. Application of DOM from both NTS and HES led to a general decrease in sorption to the soils and an increase in desorption from the soils. Desorption of chlorotoluron also significantly increased (P < 0.05) with an increase in the DOM concentration. Additionally, for sorption and desorption, at each DOM treatment level the NTS treatments were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the HES treatments. This implied that non-treated sludge had a greater effect on the sorption and desorption of chlorotoluron than heat-expanded sludge.																	1002-0160					AUG	2005	15	4					432	439								WOS:000230707200004		
J	Smith, EM; Benner, R				Smith, EM; Benner, R			Photochemical transformations of riverine dissolved organic matter: effects on estuarine bacterial metabolism and nutrient demand	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												By experimentally simulating the exposure of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) to sunlight during the mixing of river water and seawater in an estuary (St. Helena Sound, South Carolina), this study examined how photochemical alterations may affect both the magnitude and fate of DOM utilization by estuarine bacteria. In a series of experiments performed with water samples collected from 3 blackwater rivers draining into an estuary of the South Atlantic Bight (USA), exposure to light resulted in significant decreases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM absorption at 350 nm relative to dark controls. When these water samples were subsequently inoculated with an estuarine bacterial community, prior exposure to light significantly increased bacterial growth, respiration and total DOC consumption relative to that observed in control treatments. Increases in respiration (46 to 78%) were, however, always greater than increases in growth (19 to 35%). This resulted in decreases in bacterial growth efficiency that ranged from 16 to 33% and appeared predictable from initial differences in DOM optical characteristics. In addition, although light exposure consistently resulted in significant NH4 production, bacterial metabolism in light treatments was accompanied by a significant increase in bacterial demand for inorganic nutrients (117 to 243% over dark controls). These results indicate that irradiation of terrigenous DOM significantly alters its ultimate fate (CO2 VS. bacterial biomass) and that bacterial carbon metabolism of photoaltered DOM is coupled to an enhanced demand for inorganic nutrients, which may considerably influence ecosystem-scale carbon and nutrient interactions in the coastal zone.

The model is based on nitrate as the sole limiting nutrient. Prognostic equations for nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus are solved online in the three-dimensional ocean circulation model component. Experiments with different parameterizations of vertical mixing, including a scheme of tidally driven mixing, changes in buoyancy forcing in the Southern Ocean, different particle sinking velocities, and the inclusion of dissolved organic matter are performed, and the results are compared with observations. The results reemphasize the roles of Southern Ocean freshwater forcing and diapycnal mixing in the low-latitude pycnocline in setting the global deep water circulation and properties. The influence of high mixing in the Southern Ocean as inferred from observations is much more limited. The deep water circulation also has a strong influence on the marine ecosystem and nutrient distributions. We demonstrate that larger values of vertical diffusion lead to a shallower nutricline due to increased upwelling. Export production and nutrient distributions respond sensitively to changes in mixing and to the ratio of particle sinking to remineralization in the upper ocean. The best fits to global measurements of temperature, salinity, deep ocean radiocarbon, mixed layer depth, nutrients, and chlorophyll are obtained for values of vertical mixing in the pycnocline of around 0.2-0.3 x 10(-4) m(2)/s and for e-folding depth for particle remineralization of 100-200 m. A simple parameterization of dissolved organic matter dynamics increases primary production and nutrient concentrations in the upper ocean and improves chlorophyll distributions in the subtropical gyres but has no discernible influence on particulate export fluxes. Remaining model deficiencies are identified, and strategies for future model improvement are outlined.

J	Sarathy, V; Allen, HE				Sarathy, V; Allen, HE			Copper complexation by dissolved organic matter from surface water and wastewater effluent	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Organic matter from wastewater treatment plants (wastewater organic matter, WWOM) has not been extensively studied with respect to complexation with copper, unlike natural organic matter (NOM). Acid-base and copper titrations were conducted on both types of organic matter. Experimental copper complexation data were compared to predictions from the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM) Version VI. We found that NOM and WWOM have ligands with similar proton binding, but the copper binding of WWOM is not well predicted by WHAM especially at low copper concentrations because the concentrations of ligands that are most important at the low copper concentrations (below 10(-6) M) were found to be about 15 times higher in the WWOM. Consideration of sulfide present in the wastewater effluent does not fully explain this deviation. Due to the possibility that there exist nonhumics like biological macromolecules in WWOM, it may need to be considered, as an alternative ligand to humics in toxicity and speciation predicting models like the biotic ligand model (BLM).

Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR-MS) was used to resolve the complex mixtures of DOM and provide valuable information on elemental compositions on a molecular scale. We characterized and compared DOM from two sharply contrasting aquatic environments, algal-derived DOM from the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) and terrigenous DOM from pore water of a tropical mangrove area in northern Brazil. Several thousand molecular formulas in the mass range of 300-600 Da were identified and reproduced in element ratio plots. On the basis of molecular elemental composition and double-bond equivalents (DBE) we calculated an average composition for marine DOM. O/C ratios in the marine samples were lower (0.36 +/- 0.01) than in the mangrove pore-water sample (0.42). A small proportion of chemical formulas with higher molecular mass in the marine samples were characterized by very low O/C and H/C ratios probably reflecting amphiphilic properties. The average number of unsaturations in the marine samples was surprisingly high (DBE = 9.9; mangrove pore water: DBE = 9.4) most likely due to a significant contribution of carbonyl carbon. There was no significant difference in elemental composition between surface and deep-water DOM in the Weddell Sea. Although there were some molecules with unique marine elemental composition, there was a conspicuous degree of similarity between the terrigenous and algal-derived end members. Approximately one third of the molecular formulas were present in all marine as well as in the mangrove samples. We infer that different forms of microbial degradation ultimately lead to similar structural features that are intrinsically refractory, independent of the source of the organic matter and the environmental conditions where degradation took place.

The results of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colloidal organic carbon (COC) analysis, trucking the isolation of colloids from river waters, show that 2 mg/L of COC was present in those samples and good CC mass balance (77-101%) was achieved. Fluorescence measurements were carried out for the investigation of retentate and permeate behaviour of coloured dissolved organic materials (CDOM). The concentrations of CDOM in both the retentate and permeate increased with increasing cf, although CDOM were significantly more concentrated in the retentate. The permeation model expressing the correlation between log[CDOM] in the permeate and log cf was able to describe the permeation behaviour of CDOM in the river water with regression coefficients (r(2)) of 0.94 and 0.98. Dry weight analysis indicated that the levels of organic colloidal particles were from 49 to 71%, and between 29 and 51% of colloidal particles present were inorganic. COC as a percentage of DOC was found to be 10-16% for Longford Stream samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we evaluated the role of salt-marsh sediment-derived DOM vs. DOM-free seawater on the acute and chronic toxicity of three pesticides (chlorothalonil-CHTH, chlorpyrifos-CHPY and fipronil-FIP) to the meiobenthic copepod Amphiascus tenuiremis. Acute toxicity was evaluated via standard 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50), while chronic toxicity was evaluated for 16 days using a 96-well microplate life-cycle bioassay. DOM significantly reduced (p < 0.05) acute toxicity of CHTH and CHPY to male and female copepods relative to copepods exposed in DOM-free seawater. In contrast, DOM elevated the acute toxicity of FIP to male copepods. In chronic exposures with/without DOM, CHTH and CHPY did not significantly affect copepodite-to-adult development. In these treatments, plus controls, the majority (95%) of copepodites developed into adults by 8 days. Individuals exposed to FIP in the presence of DOM showed a slower development rate than FIP individuals in DOM-free seawater. Overall, FIP exposed copepodites developed into adult copepods 4 days later than controls. CHTH, CHPY and FIP significantly reduced reproductive success by 33%, 31% and 89%, respectively. DOM, however, mitigated 30% (p=0.006) and 20% (p=0.05) of the reproductive failure attributed to CHTH and CHPY. FIP-induced reproductive failure was high (similar to 80%) in all exposures regardless of DOM presence/absence. An exponential growth model predicted that exposure to CHTH, CHPY and FIP in the absence of DOM significantly reduced (>= 38%) projected naupliar production relative to DOM-free controls. In the presence of DOM, naupliar production under CHTH and CHPY exposures was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from control projections. These results indicate that DOM generally reduced the acute and chronic toxicity of CHTH and CHPY to A. tenuiremis, while certain compound-specific pesticide (FIP): organic associations may enhance acute toxicity of FIP, particularly to male copepods.

J	Bejarano, AC; Decho, AW; Chandler, GT				Bejarano, AC; Decho, AW; Chandler, GT			The role of various dissolved organic matter forms on chlorpyrifos bioavailability to the estuarine bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is comprised of a myriad of macromolecules with specific physical and chemical properties that may influence the bioavailability of hydrophobic pesticides to animals. This study was conducted to assess the role of various forms of DOM on the uptake and bioconcentration of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CHPY) to the bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria. Bivalves were exposed to DOM-free seawater (30 parts per thousand) or to seawater containing a single form of DOM. DOM forms included two filtrate fractions of natural salt-marsh sediment DOM (DOM-(< 0.45 mu m) and DOM-(< 3 kDa)); natural purified humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) acids; and water soluble cyclic oligosaccharides alpha and beta cyclodextrins (CD-alpha and CD-beta). In C-14-CHPY uptake and elimination experiments, juvenile bivalves were exposed to uniformly-labeled C-14-CHPY and collected at time intervals during 48 h. The remaining bivalves were transferred to C-14-CHPY-free elimination chambers with bivalve collection at time intervals over 144 h. Total uptake of C-14-CHPY by bivalves in DOM-free seawater was > 40% greater than in bivalves exposed to C-14-CHPY in the presence of most DOM forms. These results are consistent with much faster C-14-CHPY uptake rates estimated using a simple two parameter model. After the elimination period, bivalves exposed to DOM-free seawater had C-14-CHPY body residue concentrations between 25% and 86% greater than bivalves in the presence of DOM forms. Experiments with larger bivalves showed that pulse-chase exposures with a 1.5 h exposure period to C-14-CHPY was not long enough to detect differences in C-14-CHPY tissue accumulation efficiencies across treatments. Our findings suggest that natural forms of DOM, at environmentally realistic organic carbon concentrations, reduced pesticide uptake and bioconcentration, consistent with much lower uptake rates relative to bivalves exposed to C-14-CHPY in the absence of DOM. Interestingly, at the tested organic carbon concentrations CD-alpha and CD-beta did not reduce C-14-CHPY bioconcentration in M. mercenaria. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to determine the extent of degradation of sorbed OM and to investigate changes in its composition during degradation. DOM of different origins was sorbed to a subsoil and incubated for 1 year. We quantified mineralized C by frequent CO2 measurements in the headspace of the incubation vessels and calculated mean residence times by a double exponential model. Mineralization of C of the corresponding DOM in solution was used as a control to estimate the extent of DOM stabilization by sorption. Changes in the composition of sorbed OM during the incubation were studied by spectroscopic (UV, fluorescence) and isotope (C-13, C-14) measurements after hot-water extraction of OM. The fraction of sorbed organic C mineralized during the incubation was only one-third to one-sixth of that mineralized in solution. The mean residence time of the most stable OM sample was estimated to increase from 28 years in solution to 91 years after sorption. For highly degradable DOM samples, the portion of stable C calculated by a double exponential model nearly doubled upon sorption. With less degradable DOM the stability increased by only 20% after sorption. Therefore, the increase in stability due to sorption is large for labile DOM high in carbohydrates and relatively small for stable DOM high in aromatic and complex molecules. Nevertheless, in terms of stability the rank order of OM types after sorption was the same as in solution. Furthermore, the extent of sorption of recalcitrant compounds was much larger than sorption of labile compounds. Thus, sorptive stabilization of this stable DOM sample was four times larger than for the labile ones. We conclude that stabilization of OM by sorption depends on the intrinsic stability of organic compounds sorbed. We propose that the main stabilization processes are selective sorption of intrinsically stable compounds and strong chemical bonds to the mineral soil and/or a physical inaccessibility of OM to microorganisms. The UV, fluorescence and C-13 measurements indicated that aromatic and complex compounds, probably derived from lignin, were preferentially stabilized by sorption of DOM. The C-13 and C-14 data showed that degradation of the indigenous OM in the mineral soil decreased after sorption of DOM, We estimated DOM sorption stabilizes about 24 Mg C ha(-1) highlighting the importance of sorption for accumulation and preservation of OM in soil. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Water samples were titrated with zinc and free zinc ion activity {Zn2+}, was calculated from the measurement of labile zinc by SWASV and other system conditions. Measured values of {Zn2+}, which were in the range 10(-7) to 10(-5) M, were compared with those simulated using Humic Ion-Binding Models V and VI. It was assumed that zinc speciation was controlled by the organic matter, represented by fulvic acid (FA), together with inorganic solution complexation. The models were calibrated by adjusting the parameter DOMFA, the proportion of DOM considered to behave as FA. Two modeling scenarios were used to obtain DOMFA values, both considering and not considering the competitive effects of Al, Fe(II) and Fe(III). The default Zn-DOM binding strength in Model VI (log K-MA = 1.6) was not able to provide realistic values of DOMFA and a log K-MA of 1.8 was tentatively proposed as a more plausible value in these waters. Models V and VI gave very similar fits to the data after optimization of DOMFA, in contrast to recent findings for copper. This may be due to the fact that the additional strong binding sites provided by Model VI are not important in complexing Zn in the Zn concentration range investigated in this study. Computed free Zn activities from both modeling scenarios were very similar; however, the consideration of Al and Fe competition is more realistic for natural waters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Benner, R; Louchouarn, P; Amon, RMW				Benner, R; Louchouarn, P; Amon, RMW			Terrigenous dissolved organic matter in the Arctic Ocean and its transport to surface and deep waters of the North Atlantic	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												[1] Surface waters of the Arctic Ocean have the highest concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) of all ocean basins. Concentrations of dissolved lignin phenols in polar surface waters are 7-fold to 16-fold higher than those in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and stable carbon isotopic compositions of DOM are depleted in C-13 by 1 - 2 parts per thousand relative to those in the Atlantic and Pacific. The large contribution of terrigenous DOM from Arctic rivers is responsible for the elevated concentrations of DOC in polar surface waters. The distribution of terrigenous DOM in polar surface waters is very heterogeneous, but on average we estimate 14 - 24% of the DOC is of terrestrial origin. Stable nitrogen isotopic compositions were useful for distinguishing DOM of Pacific and Atlantic origins as well as terrigenous and marine origins. The size distribution and composition of lignin phenols provide some evidence of photochemical transformations of terrigenous DOM, but it appears this process is not extensive in polar surface waters. The extent to which terrigenous DOM is removed from the Arctic Ocean by microbial degradation is less clear and warrants further study. Physical transport of terrigenous DOC to the North Atlantic is a major mechanism for its removal from the Arctic. The East Greenland Current alone exports 4.4 - 6.6 Tg of terrigenous DOC annually to the North Atlantic. Terrigenous DOC of Arctic origin was identified for the first time in components of North Atlantic Deep Water. Preliminary estimates indicate that similar to 1 Tg of terrigenous DOC is exported from the Arctic in Denmark Strait Overflow Water with an additional similar to 0.7 Tg in Classical Labrador Sea Water. Together, these exports compose approximately 25 - 33% of the terrigenous DOC discharged annually to the Arctic via rivers.

High levels of variation occur in a range of water quality parameters such as turbidity, alkalinity, colour, natural organic matter, algae and micro-organ isms. The removal of organic matter using inorganic coagulants is impacted by the character and concentration of the organics and the turbidity and alkalinity of the raw water. Mathematical models that relate the character and concentration of dissolved organic matter in raw water to inorganic coagulant dosing that maximize removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been developed. These models were used to predict alum doses that were subsequently applied to treat waters from two Australian drinking.water sources (Googong and Middle River reservoirs) under jar test conditions and in pilot plant trials. Percentage removals of DOC were similar to 50-60% with application of model predicted alum doses for maximizing removal of DOC when coagulation was performed at pH 6. Much higher coagulant dosing at similar pH resulted in comparatively minor additional removal of DOC. Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) under standard laboratory conditions was found to be proportional to the residual DOC concentrations and appeared to be linearly related. Formation of individual THMs was consistent in each water source but differed between the two sources.				van Leeuwen, John/G-3155-2011													0011-9164					JUN 10	2005	176	1-3					81	89		10.1016/j.desal.2004.10.024						WOS:000230869300009

At resin doses up to 600 mg/L, DOC levels were reduced from 30 to 70%, while total trihalomethane and haloacetic acid formation reactivity (i.e., TTHM/DOC and HAA9/DOC) was reduced from 40 to 70% and 50%, respectively. This suggests that ion exchange, alone or in combination with other processes, holds promise for removing a broad spectrum of DBP precursors. Chloride release was measured to confirm an ion exchange mechanism, but the possibility of physisorption and hydrogen bonding mechanisms was not ruled out. Ion exchange appeared to selectively remove high-specific UV-absorbing (i.e., SUVA(254)) DOM components from the TMK water; these components also had the highest molecular weights. However, this was not the case for the MB water. The "SUVA(254) profile", the relationship between SUVA(254) and DBP formation reactivity (TTHM/DOC and HAA9/DOC), showed significant differences from the patterns observed previously for separation processes (e.g., coagulation and activated carbon adsorption) that rely primarily on hydrophobic interactions as a separation mechanism.

In addition, little is known about the specific components of the DOM pool utilized by SAR11 bacteria. To better understand the role of SAR11 bacteria in the flux of DOM, we examined the assimilation of leucine (a measure of biomass production), as well as free amino acids, protein, and glucose, by SAR11 bacteria in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. We found that when SAR11 bacteria were > 25 % of total prokaryotes, they accounted for about 30 to 50 % of leucine incorporation, suggesting that SARII bacteria were major contributors to bacterial biomass production and the DOM flux. Specific growth rates of SAR11 bacteria either equaled or exceeded growth rates for the total prokaryotic community. In addition, SAR11 bacteria were typically responsible for a greater portion of amino acid assimilation (34 to 61 %) and glucose assimilation (45 to 57 %) than of protein assimilation (<= 34 %). These data suggest that SAR11 bacteria do not utilize various components of the DOM pool equally and may be more important to the flux of low-molecular-weight monomers than to that of high-molecular-weight polymers.

J	Hood, E; Williams, MW; Mcknight, DM				Hood, E; Williams, MW; Mcknight, DM			Sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a Rocky Mountain stream using chemical fractionation and stable isotopes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important vehicle for the movement of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic systems. To investigate how the source and composition of aquatic DOM change in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and isotopic analyses to characterize DOM in a headwater catchment in the Colorado Front Range. Streamwater samples for DOM analyses were collected from 2 sites, a lightly vegetated alpine site and a forested, subalpine site, in the North Boulder Creek catchment during the snowmelt runoff season (May-September). Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) peaked on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph at both the alpine (2.6 mg C l(-1)) and the subalpine sites (7.0 mg C l(-1)) and decreased sharply on the descending, limb of the hydrograph. Fractionation of DOM into operationally defined humic and non-humic components showed that the fulvic acid content of DOC decreased through the season at both sites and that spectroscopic (fluorescence and ultraviolet) properties of the humic DOM fraction shifted in a manner consistent with an increase in the proportion of humic DOM derived from instream sources as compared to terrestrial catchment sources. Humic and non-humic fractions of DOM isolated near peak flow in June and during low flows in September showed a seasonal enrichment in N-15 and C-13 as well as a seasonal decrease in the ratio of aromatic to aliphatic carbon, both of which were correlated with a decrease in the C:N ratio of the DOM fractions. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in the isotopic and chemical characteristics of DOM are a result of changes in catchment sources of DOM. In particular, it appears that DOM production in alpine lakes is an important contributor to the streamwater DOM load during late season low flows, especially in the alpine reach of the catchment. Our results further suggest that stable isotopes of C and N are useful tools, particularly when combined with ancillary data such as elemental analyses and catchment discharge, for evaluating sources and transformations of DOM at the catchment scale.

J	Gueguen, C; Guo, LD; Tanaka, N				Gueguen, C; Guo, LD; Tanaka, N			Distributions and characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter in the Western Arctic Ocean	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) is continuously discharged by rivers into the ocean, yet its distribution and reactivity within ocean basins remain poorly defined. With high concentrations of terrestrial DOM in arctic rivers and a disproportionate share of global riverine discharge on a volume basis to the Arctic Ocean, the influence of terrigenous DOM on marine carbon budgets and the global carbon cycle can be significant. In this paper, we report the detection of terrestrial DOM using optical properties of surface waters in the Western Arctic Ocean. The distribution of absorption and fluorescence of colored dissolved organic matter (C-DOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were recorded. Mixing of C-DOM was conservative at low and mid-salinity (S > 25 parts per thousand), indicating a terrestrial origin for this material and the absence of strong in situ sources and sinks. However, at higher salinities (> 25 parts per thousand), GDOM distribution was highly scattered due to the mixing of water masses of statistically different optical properties. Higher absorption coefficients and GDOM and DOC concentrations reflect the higher contribution of terrigenous DOM. The region most influenced by land-derived DOM is the Mackenzie Shelf where the 3D excitation/emission matrix spectra show a strong signature of continental inputs. Furthermore, the absence of a typical marine DOM signal indicates that a terrigenous component dominated GDOM composition throughout the entire Western Arctic Ocean. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

NOM, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), was monitored daily in the White River and the Indiana-American water treatment plant over 22 months. Other parameters were either measured daily (UV-absorbance, alkalinity, color, temperature) or continuously (turbidity, pH, and discharge) and used with stepwise linear regressions to predict DOC concentrations. The predictive models were validated with monthly samples of the river water and treatment plant effluent taken over a 2-year period after the daily monitoring had ended. Biodegradable DOC (BDOC) concentrations were measured in the river water and plant effluent twice monthly for 18 months. The BDOC measurements, along with measurements of humic and carbohydrate constituents within the DOC and BDOC pools, revealed that carbohydrates were the organic fraction with the highest percent removal during treatment, followed by BDOC, humic substances, and refractory DOC.																	0013-936X					JUN 1	2005	39	11					4258	4264		10.1021/es040480k						WOS:000229662200058	15984808	
J	Marschner, B; Winkler, R; Jodemann, D				Marschner, B; Winkler, R; Jodemann, D			Factors controlling the partitioning of pyrene to dissolved organic matter extracted from different soils	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												The mobility of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in soils can be influenced by the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). While numerous studies have determined interactions of HOCs with humic and fulvic acids, only few data exist on the partitioning of HOCs to natural, non-fractionated DOM as it occurs in soil solutions. In this study, DOM was extracted from 17 soil samples with a broad range of chemical and physical properties, originating from different land uses. The partition coefficients of pyrene to DOM were determined in all soil extracts and for two commercial humic acids using the fluorescence quenching method. For the soil extracts, log K-DOC values ranged from 3.2 to 4.5 litres kg(-1). For the Aldrich and Fluka humic acids, log K-DOC was 4.98 and 4.96 litres kg(-1), respectively, thus indicating that they are not representative for soil DOM. After excluding these two values, the statistical analysis of the data showed a significant negative correlation between log K-DOC and pH. This was also shown for one sample where the pH was adjusted to values ranging from 3 to 9. A multiple regression analysis suggested that ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm (an indicator for aromaticity) and the E4:E6 ratio (an indicator for molecular weight) had additional effects on log K-DOC. The results indicate that the partitioning of pyrene to DOM is reduced at alkaline pH, probably due to the increased polarity of the organic macromolecules resulting from the deprotonation of functional groups. Only within a narrow pH range was the K-DOC of pyrene mainly related to the aromaticity of DOM.																	1351-0754					JUN	2005	56	3					299	306		10.1111/j.1365-2389.2004.00678.x						WOS:000229190600003

In this study, nutrient diffusing artificial substrates were used to examine bacterial responses to DOM (i.e., glucose, leaf leachate, and algal exudates) and inorganic nutrients (nitrate and phosphate singly and in combination). Artificial substrates were deployed for five seasons, from summer 2002 to summer 2003, in a northeastern Ohio stream. Differences were observed in the responses of bacterial taxa examined to various DOM and inorganic nutrient treatments, and the response patterns varied seasonally, indicating that resources that limit the bacterial communities change over time. Overall, the greatest responses were to labile, low-molecular-weight DOM (i.e., glucose) at times when chlorophyll a concentrations were low due to scouring during significant storm events. Different types of DOM and inorganic nutrients induced various responses among bacterial taxa in the biofilms examined, and these responses would not have been apparent if they were examined at the community level or if seasonal changes were not taken into account.																	0099-2240					MAY	2005	71	5					2278	2287		10.1128/AEM.71.5.2278-2287.2005						WOS:000229105300012	15870312	
J	Wu, FC; Mills, RB; Cai, YR; Evans, RD; Dillon, PJ				Wu, FC; Mills, RB; Cai, YR; Evans, RD; Dillon, PJ			Photodegradation-induced changes in dissolved organic matter in acidic waters	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from stream waters was investigated using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, ultraviolet-visible absorbance, three-dimensional excitational emission matrix fluorescence, and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The effects of altering pH and various iron concentrations on DOM characteristics during irradiation were examined. DOC concentration, absorbance, and fluorescence all decreased with increasing irradiation. These decreases were accompanied by a decrease in absorbance spectral slope and average molecular size and a blue-shift in fluorescence maximum; decreasing pH enhanced these changes. The photooxidation rate constants were wavelength dependent. For the ratio of the photooxidation rate constant at pH 4 to that at pH 8 under ultraviolet irradiation, there were two maxima at wavelengths of approximately 280 and 320 nm, respectively, indicating that aromatic fractions were most pH photosensitive. The isolated humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) fractions had different photodegradation characteristics in terms of the photooxidation rate constant and the effects of pH and iron. The results suggest that iron played a more significant role in the photodegradation of the HA fraction than that of the FA fraction and that the HA fraction was mainly responsible for the observed DOM photodegradation. The results indicate that DOM photodegradation in stream waters is strongly influenced by iron and acidity.																	0706-652X					MAY	2005	62	5					1019	1027		10.1139/F05-009						WOS:000229594600006

Substrates were composed of algae extracts and an artificial substrate that mimics raw wastewater, which were considered to be autochthonous and anthropogenic allochthonous models for DOM, respectively. The soluble microbial products formed during biomass activity were also studied. The aromaticity of DOM was investigated with specific ultraviolet absorbance. Partitioning coefficients between DOM and benzo[a]pyrene, K-DOC(biol), were biologically determined by means of 4-h bioaccumulation experiments on Daphnia magna. Parent and degraded substrates always significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of benzo[a]pyrene at environmental DOM concentrations. Soluble microbial products also significantly affected the benzo[a]pyrene bioaccumulation. K-DOC(biol) ranged between 2 x 1 04 and 4 x 10(5) L/kg. As the artificial wastewater biodegraded, DOM aromaticity increased, as did K-DOC(biol). During the biodegradation of algae extract DOM, K-DOC(biol) increased, whereas their aromaticity slightly decreased. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Inaba, S; Takenaka, C				Inaba, S; Takenaka, C			Effects of dissolved organic matter on toxicity and bioavailability of copper for lettuce sprouts	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												It is well known that dissolved organic matter in soil solution may affect the toxicity or bioavailability of heavy metals to plants, but existing information on various organic substances is insufficient for treating problems with heavy metal-contaminated soils. To clarify how dissolved organic matter alters the toxicity and bioavailability of metals, we germinated lettuce seeds exposed to solutions containing Cu and several kinds of dissolved organic matters. Low molecular weight organic acids (citric, malic, and oxalic acids) increased the toxicity and bioavailability of Cu. but low concentrations of the synthetic chelators ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) decreased the toxicity and bioavailability of Cu. in contrast, humic acid appeared to be the most effective organic substance for detoxifying Cu. even though it did not significantly decrease the bioavailability of Cu. Consequently, the bioavailability and toxic effects of Cu in soil depend on the nature of coexisting organic substances in the soil solution. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the irradiation at constant light intensity, a regular oscillation in the ratio of Fe(II) to total iron, Fe(II)/Fe(t), was observed when DOM was periodically added into the solution. In each cycle, the Fe(II)/Fe(t) ratio increased initially and then decreased with concomitant degradation of DOM. The Fe(II)/Fe(t) ratio approached a constant value after the DOM was completely mineralized. The period and amplitude of the oscillation were dependent on DOM structure and its initial concentration, but the ultimate photosteady state was not affected by DOM. It was revealed that both DOM and photoreactive Fe(III) species were indispensable for the fluctuation in Fe(II)/Fe(t) ratio. The ultimate photosteady state originated from the equilibrium between Fe(III) photoreduction and aerobic Fe(II) photooxidation induced simultaneously by UV irradiation. It was the DOM that disturbed these two opposite processes, leading to the oscillation in Fe(II)/ Fe(t) ratio under UV irradiation.

In this study, we concentrated the microbial biomass from two streams in northern Michigan and a dystrophic 'bog' lake in northern Wisconsin with varying initial DOM concentration (6.7-78.8 mg C l(-1)) and DOM chemical characteristics (e.g. DOM average molecular weights from 808-1887 Da). Each of the three microbial inocula was added to each of the three DOM sources at in situ population levels for a total of nine treatments. Changes in DOM concentration and bacterial productivity, along with chemical characteristics, were examined over 308 h. The [H-3]-leucine incorporation method was used to measure microbial production. In two of three sampling sites, bacterial communities were most productive when metabolizing DOM in their native waters. A variable peak in productivity was seen between 16-48 h after inoculation, followed by a drop in productivity in most treatments, with periods of DOM production most likely due to microbial turnover. These data suggest that microbial communities are better able to degrade the DOM of their native habitats, suggesting that biodegradation of DOM is influenced by source-specific microbial species and DOM chemical characteristics.																	0018-8158					MAY 1	2005	539						1	11		10.1007/s10750-004-3079-0						WOS:000231029600001

DOM removal was characterized not only by comprehensive indices such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance at 260nm (UVA(260)) but also by spectrofluorimetry and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) analysis, which are useful techniques to obtain information on the structure of a higher percentage of DOC was removed by ferric coagulants than by the aluminum coagulant (FC: 53%, PFS: 41%, PAC: 36%). Similar trends were observed in the coagulation-induced decrease of UVA(260) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). Spectrofluorimetry showed that higher concentrations of coagulant increased the removal of DOM with fluorescence components. However, fluorescence intensity was not reduced by increased coagulant concentrations at emission wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Treatments with ferric coagulants were more effective in removing fluorescent components than PAC. Comparison of pyrochromatograms before and after coagulation revealed that the peak area of propanoic acid decreased most significantly after coagulation by FC among 16 identified fragment compounds. Four fragment compounds differed greatly in their coagulation behaviour, depending on the coagulant used.																	0003-7214					MAY	2005	54	3					157	163								WOS:000230049900003		
J	Ling, WT; Xu, JM; Gao, YZ				Ling, WT; Xu, JM; Gao, YZ			Effects of dissolved organic matter from sewage sludge on the atrazine sorption by soils	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES C-LIFE SCIENCES												The effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM), water soluble organic matter derived from sewage sludge, on the sorption of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-trazine) by soils were studied using a batch equilibrium technique. Six paddy soils, chosen so as to have different organic carbon contents, were experimented in this investigation. Atrazine sorption isotherms on soils were described by the linear equation, and the distribution coefficients without DOM (K(d)) or with DOM (K(d)*) were obtained. Generally, the values of K(d)*/K(d) initially increased and decreased thereafter with increasing DOM concentrations of 0-60 mg DOC center dot L(-1) in soil-solution system form. Critical concentrations of DOM (DOM(np)) were obtained where the value of Kd* was equal to Kd. The presence of DOM with concentrations lower than DOMnp promoted atrazine sorption on soils (K(d)* > K(d)), whereas the presence of DOM with concentrations higher than DOMnp tended to inhibit atrazine sorption (K(d)* < K(d)). Interestingly, DOM(np) for tested soils was negatively correlated to the soil organic carbon content, and the maximum of K(d)*/K(d) (i.e. K(max)) correlated positively with the maximum of DOM sorption on soil (X(max)). Further investigations showed that the presence of hydrophobic fraction of DOM evidently promoted the atrazine sorption on soils, whereas the presence of hydrophilic DOM fraction obviously tended to inhibit the atrazine sorption. Interactions of soil surfaces with DOM and its fractions were suggested to be the major processes determining atrazine sorption on soils. The results of this work provide a reference to the agricultural use of organic amendment such as sewage sludge for improving the availability of atrazine in soils.

J	Qualls, RG; Bridgham, SD				Qualls, RG; Bridgham, SD			Mineralization rate of C-14-labelled dissolved organic matter from leaf litter in soils of a weathering chronosequence	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												During the processes of primary succession and soil development, large stocks of organic C with very long residence times accumulate in many soils. Soluble organic C adsorbed by soils may contribute to the stock of organic C accumulating during soil development. We determined whether the mineralization rate of water-soluble organic C and the insoluble residue from C-14-labelled leaf litter added to soils from a weathering chronosequence decrease as soil age and adsorption capacity increase. The soils were formed on mudflows of andesitic material deposited about 75, 255, 616 y ago, and another older but undetermined time before this study. The percentage of the DOC adsorbed by the soils increased with age. After 1 year of incubation there were no significant differences in the mineralization rates of DOC added to soils of different ages. The DOC appeared to be comprised of two fractions, one that comprises about 32% of the total that mineralized with a half decay time of 0.02 y (7 d) and a second fraction comprising 68% with a half decay time of about 1.6 y. Consequently, the slowly mineralized fraction of the soluble C contributed to the accumulation of slowly mineralized C in the soil. Both the slowly and rapidly mineralized fractions of the insoluble residue decomposed more slowly than the corresponding fractions in DOC. We found no support for the idea that increased adsorption capacity due to weathering resulted in protection of soluble organic C from microbial mineralization. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yano, Y; Lajtha, K; Sollins, P; Caldwell, BA				Yano, Y; Lajtha, K; Sollins, P; Caldwell, BA			Chemistry and dynamics of dissolved organic matter in a temperate coniferous forest on Andic soils: Effects of litter quality	ECOSYSTEMS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in transporting carbon and nitrogen from forest floor to mineral soils in temperate forest ecosystems. Thus, the retention of DOM via sorption or microbial assimilation is one of the critical steps for soil organic matter formation in mineral soils. The chemical properties of DOM are assumed to control these processes, yet we lack fundamental information that links litter quality, DOM chemistry, and DOM retention. Here, we studied whether differences in litter quality affect solution chemistry and whether changes in litter inputs affect DOM quality and removal in the field. The effects of litter quality on solution chemistry were evaluated using chemical fractionation methods for laboratory extracts and for soil water collected from a temperate coniferous forest where litter inputs had been altered. In a laboratory extraction, litter type (needle, wood, root) and the degree of decomposition strongly influenced solution chemistry. Root litter produced more than 10 times more water-extractable dissolved organic N (DON) than any other litter type, suggesting that root litter may be most responsible for DON production in this forest ecosystem. The chemical composition of the O-horizon leachate was similar under all field treatments (doubled needle, doubled wood, and normal litter inputs). O-horizon leachate most resembled laboratory extracts of well-decomposed litter (that is, a high proportion of hydrophobic acids), in spite of the significant amount of litter C added to the forest floor and a tendency toward higher mean DOM under doubled-Litter treatments. A lag in DOM production from added litter or microbial modification might have obscured chemical differences in DOM under the different treatments. Net DOM removal in this forest soil was strong; DOM concentration in the water deep in the mineral soil was always low regardless of concentrations in water that entered the mineral soil and of litter input manipulation. High net removal of DOM from O-horizon leachate, in spite of extremely low initial hydrophilic neutral content (labile DOM), coupled with the lack of influence by season or soil depth, suggests that DOM retention in the soil was mostly by abiotic sorption.																	1432-9840					APR	2005	8	3					286	300		10.1007/s10021-005-0022-9						WOS:000229935500005		
J	Butler, MN; Weber, WJ				Butler, MN; Weber, WJ			Accelerated transformation and deactivation of erythromycin in superheated water. 1. Temperature effects, transformation rates, and the impacts of dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The presence of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals in the environment is of increasing concern. The stringent treatment of point discharges of antibiotic wastes holds promise as an approach for curtailing growing trends of microbial resistance. The work described in this two-part series explores the use of superheated water as a medium for the accelerated transformation and deactivation of a specific target antibiotic, erythromycin. Part 1 of the series focuses on parent compound conversion, and Part 2 examines transformation mechanisms and reaction products. This paper, Part 1, highlights the results of reactor studies performed in both batch and flow-through modes. The data presented confirm that accelerated conversion of erythromycin, based on parent compound disappearance as measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, occurs in water under superheated conditions. Given an initial erythromycin concentration of 50 mg/L, greater than 85% apparent conversion was achieved within 30 min in the batch system at all temperatures investigated in the range from 125 to 200 degrees C. The presence of dissolved organic matter extracted from two natural soil materials, at concentrations of 2.5-20 mg/L, was shown to have little effect on the overall extent of transformation of erythromycin in the batch system. The rates of decomposition observed were found to be best described by a psuedo-first-order expression, one in which the rate coefficient increased linearly with increasing initial concentration of the antibiotic. First-order rate behavior was verified in subsequent flow reactor experiments. The temperature dependence of rate was also examined, and an activation energy of 68.8 U/mol was determined.																	0013-936X					APR 1	2005	39	7					2294	2300		10.1021/es049398f						WOS:000228172600062	15871267

We combined plug-flow biofilm reactors, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) theramochemolysis GC-MS, and C-13-labeled TMAH thermochemolysis GC-MS to study the molecular composition of BOOM from two stream ecosystems. TMAH products derived from fatty acids, lignin, and other aromatic molecules were quantified using an internal standard approach. We applied the C-13-TMAH thermochemolysis procedure to differentiate between compounds in dissolved organic matter (DOM) that had natural methoxyl groups from those that acquired methoxyl groups during the TMAH reaction, In Rio Tempisquito, a stream draining a tropical evergreen forest, and White Clay Creek, a stream draining a temperate deciduous woodlands, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and lignin contributed to the DOM and BDOM molecular composition. We observed 97 different peaks in the chromatograms of streamwater, with 57% of the peaks common to both streams. The DOM and BOOM pools from each site also contained a unique suite of compounds. Our combined use of TMAH and 13C-TMAH thermochemolysis revealed that heterotrophic bacteria can selectively degrade and demethylate different types of compounds in the lignin residues of DOM. This demonstration of bacterial demethylation of lignin, an abundant and refractory plant molecule, has potential implications for global carbon cycling.																	0013-936X					MAR 15	2005	39	6					1479	1491		10.1021/es0494959						WOS:000227636300020	15819200

Samples taken from the Suwannee River, Georgia, USA and McDonalds Branch in the Pine Barrens, New Jersey, USA were chosen to represent waters where DOM originates from predominantly terrestrially-derived (allochthonous) precursors. Pony Lake, Antarctica represented an exclusively algal/microbially-derived ( autochthonous) DOM. Fluorescence, UV absorption, C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) were employed to discern differences and similarities between the DOM isolated by these three methods. Only subtle differences between isolation methods were observed for the terrestrially derived DOM samples when assayed by light and fluorescence spectroscopy. Conversely, the Pony Lake DOM isolates exhibit greater variability when analyzed by these methods. C-13-NMR analyses showed structural differences between the methods for all samples. HPSEC analysis also revealed differences with the C-18 isolates exhibiting the highest molecular weights. Thus, it appears that each method isolates sufficiently different fractions of DOM that can only be delineated when a consortium of analytical methods are used to assay the samples. Nonetheless real differences between autochthonous and allochthonous derived DOM were observed with the algal-derived samples exhibiting high fluorescence ratios and lower aromaticity relative to the terrestrially derived materials. These results demonstrate that caution must be exercised when interpreting DOM reactivity data that rely upon the use of specific fractions.																	1015-1621					MAR	2005	67	1					61	71		10.1007/s00027-004-0735-4						WOS:000227277300008		
J	Wetzel, RG; Tuchman, NC				Wetzel, RG; Tuchman, NC			Effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment and sunlight on degradation of plant particulate and dissolved organic matter and microbial utilization	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Particulate and dissolved organic matter were generated from foliage of the emergent macrophyte Typha latifolia and the riparian tree Populus tremuloides grown both under ambient (AMB, 360 mu l L-1) and elevated (ELEV; 720 mu l L-1) atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Percentage lignin, C: N ratios, and percentage total phenolic compounds were significantly higher (15-100%) in live and senescent plant tissues grown in ELEV than in AMB CO2 conditions. Fungal biomass and rates of growth were 25% and 50% lower on the more recalcitrant particulate organic matter of ELEV Populus and Typha, respectively, both of which had appreciably lower N content than tissues of AMB grown plants. Bacterial development on the surfaces of ELEV tissues was nearly an order of magnitude lower than on AMB grown tissues. Leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was greater from ELEV CO2-grown leaves than those grown on AMB CO2. Bacterial production rates on leachates from Populus were much higher than those from Typha, and rates were significantly lower on those released from tissues from both species grown on elevated CO2. Leaves of the different plant species were allowed to decompose for up to 13 weeks under natural conditions. At specific intervals, supernatant leachate DOC was removed, sterilized by filtration, and exposed to natural light (full sunlight or PAR without UV). Simple organic substrates or CO2 generated photolytically were determined and the effects of the products on bacterial productivity were assayed at intervals for several days. Complete photolytic mineralization to CO2 of DOC freshly released (24 hr) from both plant species was higher (ca. 35%) from plants grown on ELEV than from AMB CO2. After longer periods of decomposition of leaves and leachates, photolytic mineralization of DOC to CO2 was reduced but that from ELEV-grown tissues was still greater than from AMB. Citric, acetic, malic, formic and other acids were cleaved from humic macromolecules by short (< 6 hr) exposures to sunlight. Although PAR was not as effective as full sunlight with UV components, photolytic generation of fatty acids by PAR was clearly a major photodegradation process. Bacterial production was always significantly enhanced by brief (< 6 hr) exposure of leachates to either full sunlight or to PAR only.																	0003-9136					MAR	2005	162	3					287	308		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0287						WOS:000228391300001

A batch equilibrium technique was used to evaluate the effects of organic fertilizer-derived DOM on sorption of three organic chemicals (2,4-D, naphthalene and chlorpyrifos) in USGA (United States Golf Association) sand, a mixed soil (70% USGA sand and 30% native soil) and a silt loam soil (Typic Fragiochrept). DOM was extracted from two commercial organic fertilizers. Column leaching experiments were also performed using USGA sand. Sorption experiments showed that sorption capacity was significantly reduced with increasing DOM concentration in solution for all three chemicals. Column experimental results were consistent with batch equilibrium data. These results suggest that organic fertilizer-derived DOM might lead to enhanced transport of applied chemicals in turf soils.

J	Vahatalo, AV; Wetzel, RG; Paerl, HW				Vahatalo, AV; Wetzel, RG; Paerl, HW			Light absorption by phytoplankton and chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the drainage basin and estuary of the Neuse River, North Carolina (USA)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined the absorption of solar radiation by phytoplankton and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) taking into account riparian shading in the rivers, reservoirs, swamps of the Neuse River Estuary and its drainage basin. 2. In the streams, CDOM typically absorbed 55 and 64% of photons in the spectral range of 400-700 nm (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) and 500-600 nm, respectively. The large proportion of photons absorbed by CDOM indicates high potential for abiotic photochemial reactions in the 500-600 nm region. 3. Despite the high concentration of nutrients, phytoplankton contributed little (2%) to the total absorption of PAR in the streams. Small (<30 m wide) streams typically received only 7% of incident PAR that impinged onto the more exposed reservoirs and estuary. Riparian shading and the low contribution of phytoplankton to the total absorption resulted in conditions where phytoplankton absorbed nearly two orders of magnitude less PAR in the streams than in the estuary and reservoirs. 4. The results indicated that riparian shading and non-algal absorbing components can significantly restrict phytoplankton production in nutrient-rich streams with a high concentration of CDOM flowing throughout forested catchments.																	0046-5070					MAR	2005	50	3					477	493		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01335.x						WOS:000226962200008		
J	Ilani, T; Schulz, E; Chefetz, B				Ilani, T; Schulz, E; Chefetz, B			Interactions of organic compounds with wastewater dissolved organic matter: Role of hydrophohic fractions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The role of structural fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from wastewater in the sorption process of hydrophobic organic compounds is still not clear. In this study, DOM from two wastewater treatment plants (Lachish and Netanya, Israel) was fractionated to hydrophobic acid (HoA) and hydrophobic neutral (HoN) fractions. The fractions were characterized and their sorptive capabilities for s-triazine herbicides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were studied. For all sorbates, the binding to the HoN fractions was much higher than to HoA fractions. ne HoA fractions were more polar than the HoN fractions, containing a higher level of carboxylic functionalities. However the higher binding coefficients of atrazine (2-chloro4-ethylamine-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and ametryn [2-(ethylamino)-4-isopropylamino-6-methyl-thio-s-triazine] obtained for the HoN fractions suggest that their sorption is governed by hydrophobic-like interactions rather than H bonding. The values of binding coefficients of PAHs measured for the HoN fractions were within the range reported for humic acids and much higher than other fractions, suggesting that this fraction plays an important role in the overall sorption of these compounds by DOM. Higher sorption coefficients were measured for the Netanya DOM sample containing higher level of hydrophobic fractions (HoA + HoN) than the Lachish DOM, suggesting that the sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds by DOM is governed by the level of these structural substances. The evaluation of mobility of organic pollutants by wastewater irrigation requires not only assessment of the total carbon concentration but also, more importantly, the content of the hydrophobic fractions.																	0047-2425					MAR-APR	2005	34	2					552	562								WOS:000228014800019	15758108

Fluorescence measurements can be used as a tracer for quantitative and qualitative changes occurring in the DOM pool as a whole. An earlier study found that the fluorescence signal could be modeled by five fractions. This study presents an analysis on a considerably larger data set (> 1,200 samples) resulting from a 1-yr sampling program in Horsens Estuary, Denmark. Eight fluorescent fractions were identified. Four biogenic terrestrial, two anthropogenic, and two protein-like fractions were identified. Analysis of covariation between the components identified source-specific fractions and the presence of common factors controlling the composition of terrestrial DOM exported from different catchments.

J	Skoog, A; Wedborg, M; Lara, R; Kattner, G				Skoog, A; Wedborg, M; Lara, R; Kattner, G			Spring distribution of dissolved organic matter in a system encompassing the Northeast Water Polynya: Implications for early-season sources and sinks	MARINE CHEMISTRY												This study addresses sources and diagenetic state of early-season dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Northeast Water Polynya (NEWP) area northeast of Greenland from distributions of humic substance fluorescence (HSfl), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the water column inside and outside the NEWP area. The water masses of the polynya area had acquired their spring/summer temperature-salinity characteristics at the time of sampling, and also had individual, different DOM signatures. DOC concentrations were variable within and among water masses in the polynya area, indicating patchy local sources and sinks of DOC. PySW and polynya intermediate water (PyIW) had higher average DON concentrations and average lower C:N ratios than polynya bottom water (PyBW), indicating a larger fraction of fresh DOM in PySW and PyIW than in PyBW. Ice-covered, polynya area surface waters (PySW) had higher DOC concentrations (113 +/- 14 mu M, n=68) than surface water (SW) outside the polynya area (96 +/- 18 mu M, n=6). The DOM C:N ratios in a low-salinity, ice-melt subgroup of PySW samples indicate labile material, and these low-salinity surface waters appeared to have a local DOC and DON source. In contrast, HSfl was significantly lower inside than outside the NEWP area. Despite the lower HSfl values within the NEWP area, the PySW values were high when compared to open-ocean water. There were no local terrestrial sources for HSfl to the NEWP area and the East Greenland Current is therefore proposed as a likely source of allochtonous HSfl. When HSfl was used as a conservative tracer, up to similar to 70% of the water in PySW and PyIW was found to be derived from SW, which contains a high fraction of water from the East Greenland Current. Similarly, a mixing model based on HSfl indicated that similar to 80% of early-season DOC and 90-100% of early-season DON in PySW and PyIW were derived from SW, indicating a potentially high fraction of terrestrially-derived, relatively refractory DOM in the early-season NEWP area.

J	Amiri, F; Bornick, H; Worch, E				Amiri, F; Bornick, H; Worch, E			Sorption of phenols onto sandy aquifer material: the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM)	WATER RESEARCH												The influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) oil the sorption of four phenols, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), pentachlorophenol (PCP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) and 2-methyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (2-M-4,6-DNP), onto sandy aquifer material at different pH values was investigated using flow through column experiments. The pH-dependent sorption of the chlorinated phenols 2,4,6-TCP and PCP was not significantly affected by DOM (measured as dissolved organic carbon, DOC), whereas in the case of nitrophenols a significant lower retardation was found, depending on the DOC concentration and pH value of the aqueous solution. Sorption decreases with increasing DOC concentration, which indicates a binding of these compounds by DOM. The degree of sorption reduction depends on the pH value and increases with increasing fraction of neutral species. The different behaviour of nitrophenols in comparison to the chlorophenols is assumed to be a result of specific charge-transfer interactions. A combined sorption and complex formation model was used to describe the effect of pH and DOC concentration on the sorption of mitrophenols onto aquifer material and to estimate binding coefficients of neutral nitrophenols on DOM.

J	Klug, JL				Klug, JL			Bacterial response to dissolved organic matter affects resource availability for algae	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In aquatic systems, the presence of colored dissolved organic matter (DOM) may affect algal growth in numerous ways. This paper focuses on the effects of DOM on resource availability. DOM contains nitrogen and phosphorus, which may become available following microbial or photochemical degradation. Also, addition of DOM may stimulate bacterial growth, which in turn may change the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, and inorganic carbon to algae. Experiments conducted in a moderately colored lake showed that the effect of DOM on algal growth depended on the amount of nutrients present in the peat extract and on bacterial response to DOM. There was evidence for competition for phosphorus between algae and bacteria in some treatments. In addition, when both bacteria growth and algal growth were high, bacterial respiration of DOM alleviated algal carbon limitation by providing algae with an inorganic carbon source. Thus, the degree to which bacteria are stimulated by the addition of DOM will affect the amount of phosphorus and inorganic carbon available for algal growth. These results suggest that part of the difficulty in predicting algal response to changes in DOM and nutrient concentration may be due partially to variability in bacterial responses.																	0706-652X					FEB	2005	62	2					472	481		10.1139/F04-229						WOS:000228083800021

To study this, reverse osmosis (RO) has been widely used as a highly efficient method for rapid collection of large quantities of DOM from natural surface waters. The objective of this study was to examine the potential impact of the RO isolation technique on the protective effects of DOM on the toxicity of copper and zinc to the cladoceran Daphnia magna and the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. DOM was concentrated from a natural surface water using RO and at the same time a natural (unconcentrated) surface water was taken. The concentrated DOM was rediluted to the level of the natural water to obtain the so-called reconstituted water. Chemical analyses and toxicity tests were performed with both the natural surface water and the reconstituted water. First, most chemical parameters were not significantly changed by the RO sampling. For both copper and zinc, no significant differences were observed in 48 h-EC50s for D. magna and in 72 h-EC50s for P. subcapitata between the reconstituted water and the natural water. Hence, it may be concluded that reverse osmosis does not significantly affect the protective effect of natural DOM against copper and zinc toxicity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results obtained are as follows. FTIR spectra could indicate the changes of DOM during the hydrolysis process of rice straw. With the progress of rice straw hydrolysis, methyl, methylene, aromatic compounds and carbonhydrates decreased, most of aliphatic compounds were oxidized to CO2 and H2O, and others were turned into carbonates. Most of the organic silicon was hydrolyzed into inorganic silicon. The proteins, amino acids and other nitrogen were hydrolyzed to NW. All the recalcitrant fractions of rice straw, such as hemi-cellulose, cellulose and silicon sharply decreased during the process of chemical treatment. The results obtained in this paper proposed that the changes of DOM of rice straw in the hydrolysis could be an indication in the changes of chemical composition of rice straw during the hydrolyzation, and FTIR, UV and NMR were good methods to study the changes in the structure of organic compounds.																	1000-0593					FEB	2005	25	2					211	215								WOS:000227457500015

The relative share of CDOM absorption in the total absorption of blue light can reach 80%. This causes a high correlation between the CDOM absorption coefficient a(y)(400) and irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(412). The seasonal variations of CDOM and particulate absorption have a combined effect on the magnitude and shape of the irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient spectra, which is represented by a shift of the maximum transmission wavelength towards the red part of the spectrum. Such an effect has been observed in the Gulf of Gdansk during recent experiments. CDOM absorption also influences the shape of remote sensing reflectance spectra. Appropriate spectral bands for the construction of a local, empirical, remote sensing algorithm for quantification of CDOM absorption are proposed, based on the seasonal variability of remote sensing reflectance spectra. The empirical relationships between CDOM absorption and downwelling irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient and spectral reflectance are presented and their potential for quantifying CDOM absorption is explored. The CDOM absorption coefficient is highly correlated with downwelling irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient in the blue. The estimation of CDOM absorption using the downwelling irradiance measurements can be achieved with low errors: -4.6% systematic and 25.3% random. The estimation of CDOM absorption from empirical relationships between absorption and remote sensing reflectance suffers lower accuracy: 4% for systematic and 32% for random errors of estimates.

J	Hopkinson, CS; Vallino, JJ				Hopkinson, CS; Vallino, JJ			Efficient export of carbon to the deep ocean through dissolved organic matter	NATURE												Oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) constitutes one of the largest pools of reduced carbon in the biosphere. Estimated DOC export from the surface ocean represents 20% of total organic carbon flux to the deep ocean(1-3), which constitutes a primary control on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels(4). DOC is the carbon component of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and an accurate quantification of DOM pools, fluxes and their controls is therefore critical to understanding oceanic carbon cycling. DOC export is directly coupled with dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus export. However, the C:N:P stoichiometry (by atoms) of DOM dynamics is poorly understood. Here we study the stoichiometry of the DOM pool and of DOM decomposition in continental shelf, continental slope and central ocean gyre environments. We find that DOM is remineralized and produced with a C:N:P stoichiometry of 199:20:1 that is substantially lower than for bulk pools (typically >775:54:1), but greater than for particulate organic matter (106:16:1-the Redfield ratio). Thus for a given mass of new N and P introduced into surface water, more DOC can be exported than would occur at the Redfield ratio. This may contribute to the excess respiration estimated to occur in the interior ocean(5). Our results place an explicit constraint on global carbon export and elemental balance via advective pathways.

J	Schulze, WX				Schulze, WX			Protein analysis in dissolved organic matter: What proteins from organic debris, soil leachate and surface water can tell us - a perspective	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mass spectrometry based analysis of proteins is widely used to study cellular processes in model organisms. However, it has not yet routinely been applied in environmental research. Based on observations that protein can readily be detected as a component of dissolved organic matter (DOM), this article gives an example about the possible use of protein analysis in ecology and environmental sciences focusing on different terrestrial ecosystems. At this stage, there are two areas of interest: (1) the identification of phylogenetic groups contributing to the environmental protein pool, and (2) identification of the organismic origin of specific enzymes that are important for ecosystem processes. In this paper, mass spectrometric protein analysis was applied to identify proteins from decomposing plant material and DOM of soil leachates and surface water samples derived from different environments. It is concluded, that mass spectrometric protein analysis is capable of distinguishing phylogenetic origin of proteins from litter protein extracts, leachates of different soil horizons, and from various sources of terrestrial surface water. Current limitation is imposed by the limited knowledge of complete genomes of soil organisms. The protein analysis allows to relate protein presence to biogeochemical processes, and to identify the source organisms for specific active enzymes. Further applications, such as in pollution research are conceivable. In summary, the analysis of proteins opens a new area of research between the fields of microbiology and biogeochemistry.

The FSC is characterized by a complex hydrography with near-surface North Atlantic waters and deeper water masses originating from the Arctic basin. This complex hydrography results in major deviations in the elemental composition of DOM from the commonly observed depth profiles. Total organic carbon (TOC) declined from surface water masses to the low mesopelagic waters (> 600 m depth) only by approx. 16% while DON did not exhibit any trend with depth. In contrast, dissolved organic phosphor-us (DOP) decreased from the surface (0.2 muM P) to the lower mesopelagic zone by about 50%. The molar C:N ratio of the DOM was approx. 13 in the surface water masses and 7.5 in the Faroe-Shetland Channel Bottom Water (FSCBW), indicating the presence of N-rich DOM in these deep water masses while the N:P ratio of the DOM pool increased from 60:1 in the Atlantic surface waters to 117:1 in the FSCBW. Also, the amino acid yield (in percent of amino acid-C and -N to the TOC and DON pool, respectively) did not show any trend with depth, which might indicate the presence of relatively young, unaltered DOM in these deeper water masses. Moreover, the % contribution of DON and DOP to the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and phosphorus (TDP) (33% DON of TDN, 8.9% DOP of TDP) was higher in the FSCBW than in the global ocean at these depths. Thus, we conclude that Arctic water masses export bioreactive DOM into the mesopelagic North Atlantic. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of particulate and dissolved amino acids and amino sugars, as well as bulk properties of particulate and dissolved organic matter (DOM), were measured in shelf, slope and basin waters collected during the spring and summer of 2002. Particulate organic matter concentrations in shelf waters increased by a factor of 10 between spring and summer. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations exhibited only minor seasonal variations, whereas dissolved amino acid concentrations doubled between spring and summer, and dissolved amino sugars increased by 31% in shelf waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Concentrations of DOC did not exhibit a significant seasonal change in surface waters of the Canada Basin, but dissolved amino acid concentrations increased by 45% between spring and summer. No significant seasonal differences were detected in the concentration or composition of DOM in waters below 100 in in depth. Concentrations of particulate and dissolved amino acids and amino sugars were strongly correlated with chlorophyll-a, indicating a plankton source of freshly produced organic matter. The amino acid and amino sugar compositions of freshly produced DOM indicated that a large portion of this material is bioavailable. While freshly produced DOM was found to be relatively bioreactive, preformed DOM in the Arctic appears to be less bioreactive but similar in degradation state to average DOM in the Atlantic and Pacific. These data demonstrate substantial summer production of POM and DOM on the Chukchi and Beaufort shelves that is available for utilization in shelf waters and export to the Canada Basin.

In monthly collected samples, DOC varied from 43 to 146 mu M C at upstream sites in both rivers, and from 130 to 349 mu M C and from 45 to 164 ktM C in Kurose and Ohta downstream, respectively. The 3-D EEM of FDOM in the river waters identified three characteristic peaks, indicating the occurrence of fulvic acids (peak F), fluorescent whitening agents (peak W), and protein-like substances (peak T). The upstream FDOM in the both river waters and the downstream FDOM in the Ohta river contained the peaks F and T, identified by comparing with that of the Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) and tryptophan and their photo-irradiated standards. The 3-D EEM of FDOM in Kurose downstream waters, however, contained the peaks W and T. The ratio of fluorescence intensity for peak F or W to DOC (FI/DOC-index) was estimated to be high (2.00 +/- 0.51 to 2.09 +/- 0.38 QSU (quinine sulphate unit)/mu M C) at Kurose downstream compared to Ohta rivers (0.73 +/- 0.35 to 0.74 +/- 0.38 QSU/mu M C) and to the Kurose River upstream (0.55 +/- 0.22 to 0.65 +/- 0.21 QSU/mu M C), and the absolute F1 values were several times higher in Kurose downstream waters than Kurose upstream and Ohta river waters. Moreover, the studies on the photo irradiation experiments of the standard FDOMs indicated that the peak W is easily photo-decomposed while the peak F appears to be photo-resistant. These results indicate that the chemical properties of FDOM in the Kurose downstream waters are different from those in the Kurose upstream and Ohta river waters.																	0016-7002	1880-5973					2005	39	3					257	271		10.2343/geochemj.39.257						WOS:000229682400005

J	Ling, WT; Wang, HZ; Xu, JM; Gao, YZ				Ling, WT; Wang, HZ; Xu, JM; Gao, YZ			Sorption of dissolved organic matter and its effects on the atrazine sorption on soils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The dissolved organic matter (DOM), water soluble organic matter derived from sewage sludge was separated into hydrophobic fraction (Ho) and hydrophilic fraction (Hi). The sorption of DOM and its fractions on soils and the effects of DOM sorption on a nonionic pesticide (atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-trazine)) distribution between soil and water were investigated using a batch equilibrium technique. The total DOM sorption on soils described by the Langmuir equation reached saturation as the DOM concentration increased. The sorption of Ho fit the Freundlich model. In contrast, a negative retention evidently occurred as adding Hi at higher level in tested soils. The sorption of Ho dominated the total DOM sorption and the release of soil organic matter (SOM). Effects of DOM on the atrazine sorption by soils were DOM-concentration dependent and dominated by the interaction of atrazine, DOM, and soil solids. Generally, the presence of DOM with lower concentration promoted atrazine sorption on soils, namely the apparent partitioning constant (K-d*) for atrazine sorption in the presence of DOM was larger than the distribution constant (K-d) without DOM; whereas the presence of DOM with higher concentration inhibited atrazine sorption (i.e., K-d* < K-d). The overall effects of DOM on atrazine sorption in soils might be related to the DOM sorption and the release of soil intrinsic organic matter into aqueous solution. The sorption of Ho on soils promoted the atrazine sorption on soil, while the release of SOM by Hi and the competitive sorption between Hi and atrazine on soil surface led to a decrease of atrazine sorption. Information provided in this work may contribute to a better understanding of the DOM sorption and its impacts on the contaminant soil-water distribution.

J	Cheng, T				Cheng, T			Comparison of zinc complexation properties of dissolved organic matter from surface waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Unlike natural organic matter(NOM), wastewater organic matter(WWOM) from wastewater treatment plant effluents has not been extensively studied with respect to complexation reactions with heavy metals such as copper or zinc. In this study, organic matter from surface waters and a wastewater treatment plant effluent were concentrated by reverse osmosis(RO) method. The samples were treated in the laboratory to remove trace metals and major cations. The zinc complexing properties of both NOM and the WWOM were studied by square wave anodic stripping voltammetry(SWASV). Experimental data were compared to predictions using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model(WHAM) Version VI. We found that the zinc binding of WWOM was much stronger than that of NOM and not well predicted by WHAM. This suggests that in natural water bodies that receive wastewater treatment plant effluents the ratio of WWOM to NOM must be taken into account in order to accurately predict free zinc activities.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2005	17	4					535	539								WOS:000230436100002	16158574

In this study, inoculating microbes(ZJ, MS) were used in municipal solid wastes composting, and composting implemented a industrialized technology. During composting, dissolved organic matter was extracted from the compost and purified. The spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter was determined by fluorescence emission, excitation, and synchronous spectroscopy. Fluorescence emission, excitation, and synchronous spectra characterized by different relative fluorescent intensities and peaks over time. Fluorescence spectra were similar to that of fulvic acid in sewage sludge, indicating the presence of dissolved organic matter with aromatic structures and a high degree of molecular polymerization. Compared with the controls with no microbial inoculation, the microbe-inoculated treatments exhibited the increase of aromatic polycondensation, in the following order. MS + ZJ > ZJ > MS > CK.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2005	17	6					953	956								WOS:000233402200015	16465885

There was considerable consistency in the composition of the DOM between the two streams (unit mass resolution): >70% of the masses detected occurred in both streams. Approximately 40-50% of the bulk dissolved organic carbon in the stream water was bioavailable during a 12-d microbial decomposition experiment. ESI-MS compound level analysis identified which masses were used, which were not, and their patterns of utilization. In both streams, similar to40% of the masses decreased in concentration, similar to55% did not change, and <5% increased. Despite the complex system (> 1,500 DOM compounds and a natural consortia of bacteria), there was a high degree of similarity in which masses were used and the amount of each mass used between replicate flasks for a stream. There was also good agreement between the two streams in which masses were used and the amount of each mass used. This suggests that the selection by the microbial consortia of organic compounds in the complex and heretofore largely uncharacterized DOM pool is repeatable and, therefore, ultimately predictable.																	0024-3590					JAN	2005	50	1					1	12								WOS:000226406800001

Furthermore, UDOM samples were categorized by hierarchical cluster analysis based on their pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry products. Fluorescence properties Suggest that autochthonous DOM leached/exuded from biomass is quantitatively important in this system. C-13 NMR spectra showed that UDOM from the oligotrophic Taylor Slough (TS) and Florida Bay (FB) ecosystems has low aromatic C (13% +/- 3% for TS; 2% +/- 2% for FB) and very high O-atkyl C (54% +/- 4% for TS; 75% +/- 4% for FB) concentrations. High O-alkyl C concentrations in FB suggest seagrass/phytoplankton communities as dominant sources of UDOM. The amount of neutral sugars was not appreciably different between the TS and FB sites (115 +/- 12 mg C g C-1 UDOM) but their concentrations suggest a low level of diagenesis and high production rates of this material in this oligotrophic environment. Total yield of lignin phenols (vanillyl + syringyl phenols) in TS was low (0.20-0.39 mg 100 mg C-1 UDOM) compared with other riverine environments and even lower in FB (0.04-0.07 ing 100 mg C-1 UDOM) and could be a result of photodegradation and/or dilution by other autochthonous DOM. The high O-alkyl and low aromatic nature of this UDOM suggests significant biogenic inputs (as compared with soils) and limited bioavailability in this ecosystem.																	0024-3590					JAN	2005	50	1					23	35								WOS:000226406800003		
J	Baines, SB; Fisher, NS; Cole, JJ				Baines, SB; Fisher, NS; Cole, JJ			Uptake of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its importance to metabolic requirements of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We determined the rates at which Dreissena polymorpha assimilated radiolabeled acetate, monosaccharides, amino acids, and fatty acids at environmental concentration levels. The mussels incorporated all of the substances presented to them. Much of the C-14-labeled substrate that was taken up was respired to (CO2,)-C-14 indicating that the substrates were used for metabolic purposes. Nonacidic amino acids and fatty acids were taken up fastest, with absorption efficiencies (AE, percentage of filtered substrate removed) of 13% and 85%, respectively. The AEs for monosaccharides (1.5%), acetate (0.2%), and the acidic amino acid glutamic acid (0.79%) were much lower. Among the nonacidic amino acids, nonpolar forms (AE = 19.5%) were preferred over basic and polar neutral forms (AE = 9.3%). On the basis of direct measurements of free amino acid concentrations and literature estimates of free sugars, acetate, and short-chain fatty acids in surface waters, we estimated that direct uptake of these monomers amounts to similar to10-25% of the zebra mussel maintenance ration. Direct uptake of dissolved organic matter might be metabolically significant to zebra mussels.																	0024-3590					JAN	2005	50	1					36	47								WOS:000226406800004

The composition of these two fractions was investigated with solid state CP/MAS C-13 NMR, Curie point pyrolysis at 650 degrees C, with and without tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), and off-line TMAH thermochemolysis at 250 degrees C. Separation and identification of the released compounds were performed using gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The combination of these techniques allowed determination of the molecular characteristics of each fraction and showed large differences in composition. Solid state CP/MAS C-13 NMR revealed a major contribution of lignin-derived units to the hydrophobic acid fraction and the predominance of cellulose in the transphilic acid fraction. Identification of specific molecular structures upon conventional on-line pyrolysis revealed a predominantly lignin type origin for the HPOA fraction and a cellulose one for the TPIA fraction, whereas on-line TMAH/pyrolysis confirmed the presence of acids, phenolic acids and aliphatic diacids, also indicated by solid state CP/MAS 13C NMR in both fractions. Off-line TMAH thermochemolysis was determinant for evidencing the presence of amino acids. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I				Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I			Surface microlayer in lakes of different trophic status: Dissolved organic matter and microbial community	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The aim of this paper was to recognize the abundance and frequency of occurrence of neustonic organisms (i.e. bacteria and algae) and accumulation of organic matter in the surface microlayer of three lakes of various trophic status. Water samples of surface microlayer (0.5-0.6 mm) were taken (with Larsson plate) as well as from respective epilimnion layer (0.5 m deep). The samples were collected from shallow, humic (Sphagnum bog) lake (L. Flosek), shallow, eutrophic (L. Zelwazek) and deeper, mesotrophic lake (L. Kuc) in the period May-October during several years. The ratio of the organisms'. density in the surface microlayer to that in deeper (0.5 in) layer was considered as the enrichment factor (Ef). Heterotrophic bacteria accumulation in the surface microlayer was more frequent in the humic lake (75% of samples), than in meso-and eutrophic lakes (64%). Mean Ef, values for bacteria ranged from 1.3 to 1.4. Frequent, but not strong accumulation of dissolved organic matter measured as the absorbance A 254 was noted in the surface microlayer. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measured in automatic analyzer showed much stronger accumulation in microlayer, particularly in humic lake. Concentration of cblorophyll a in the surface microlayer was found as the most fluctuating and the highest mean Ef value was found in the mesotrophic lake (Ef = 6.3). An attempt was undertaken to explain these differences between the lakes in terms of variable ratio between allochthonous and autochthonous production in humic, mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes.																	1505-2249						2005	53	3					343	351								WOS:000231914300005		
J	Laegdsmand, M; de Jonge, LW; Moldrup, P				Laegdsmand, M; de Jonge, LW; Moldrup, P			Leaching of colloids and dissolved organic matter from columns packed with natural soil aggregates	SOIL SCIENCE												Transport of pollutants by colloids and dissolved organic matter (DOM) may increase the leaching of strongly sorbing pollutants (e.g., PAHs, heavy metals, radionuclides, and certain pesticides). A prerequisite for colloid- and DOM-facilitated transport is the release of colloids and DOM from soil. In the present study, the leaching of colloids and DOM from columns packed with natural soil aggregates (2-4 mm) was investigated. Aggregates with different organic matter content were used: Aggregates from Soil 1, with 3.6% organic matter content, and aggregates from Soil 2, with 2.5%. The leaching experiments showed that colloid leaching increased with higher organic matter content. Colloid leaching was strongly affected by the ionic strength of the infiltrating water but less so by the specific type of cation. However, prolonged leaching (20 h) with KCl increased the leaching of colloids, probably because of the ion exchange of naturally occurring polyvalent ions with K+. The accumulated amount of colloids leached during 20-h period was orders of magnitude lower than the amount of dispersible colloids (determined by rotation of soil water mixtures), and the organic carbon fraction (f(oc)) of the leached colloids was 3 to 4 times higher than the f(oc) of the dispersible colloids. The leaching of DOM from Soil 1 was greater, but, relative to the soil organic matter content, it was similar for the two soils. The leaching of DOM was not significantly affected by the chemistry of the irrigation water. Irrigation with solutions of KCl and deionized water increased the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient on Soil 2, due to swelling of the clay minerals and closure of the soil pores. Irrigation with CaCl2 led to lower hydrodynamic dispersion, because of shrinking clay minerals. Soil 1 was less sensitive to shrinking and swelling of clay minerals because of its higher organic matter content.				de Jonge, Lis/E-9757-2016	de Jonge, Lis/0000-0003-2874-0644												0038-075X					JAN	2005	170	1					13	27		10.1097/01.ss.0000153655.02760.bd						WOS:000226476700002

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet (UV) absorbance was measured for the filtrated water of each samples. DOC concentration and SUVA (specific UV absorbance) of biodegradation analysis samples were determined around 50 days after the incubation. In the Fukui paddy fields, DOC concentration varied seasonally from 1.1 to 10.1 mg.Cl-1, showing higher concentration in heavy runoff of non-agriculture period in April. However, DOC concentration variation did not always correspond to rainfall. The Obadake paddy fields also showed a similar pattern with Fukui paddy fields. The daily DOC discharge per area in Fukui (up), Fukui (down), Obadake (south), Obadake (north) paddy fields influent from paddy fields were 0.02, 0.0161, 0.0135 and 0.0027 kg.a(-1).day(-1), respectively. These differences resulted from differences in agricultural types and customs of farmers according to paddy fields and fields. Also, SUVA (an indirect means to evaluate humic substances (hydrophobic fraction)) of the studied influent waters from paddy fields were generally lower than the influent waters from crop fields. The non-biodegradable DOC accounted for 50.2 - 98%, 46.8 - 85.5% of the total DOC in the paddy fields and crop fields.																	0273-1223						2005	52	12					233	241								WOS:000235273600027	16477991

Based on the relations between DOC, salinity and seawater temperature, several water masses could be identified. These included riverine water, ice-melt water, surface mixed water, cold and saline shelf water, and Atlantic Ocean water. High concentrations of chlorophyll a and DOC were found in some parcels of dense shelf water in Barrow Canyon. In addition, labile DOC compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), were found in the dense shelf water, suggesting the dense shelf water contains a product (marine organic matter) of the biological CO2 pump.																	0094-8276					DEC 18	2004	31	24							L24304	10.1029/2004GL021039						WOS:000225882200002

The results show that DOM reacted with Hg(II) rapidly, and the complexation reached pseudo-equilibrium within 20 s. Maximum excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelengths shifted towards the longer wavelengths, indicating that DOM structure changed during its interaction with Hg(II). Using fluorescence quenching titrations, complexing parameters, conditional stability constants and the percentage of fluorophores participating in the complexation, were estimated by the modified Stern-Volmer equation. The experimental and field survey results suggest that the Hg-DOM complexation in various streams was related to water quality parameters, e.g. DOC, Cl-, and cation concentrations, and was strongly affected by UV irradiation.																	0168-2563					DEC	2004	71	3					339	351		10.1007/s10533-004-0058-5						WOS:000226667200004

First, the distribution of a UV-B-sensitive zooplankton genus, Daphnia, was examined as a function of DOM concentration and maximum depth (Z(max)) in 258 systems. Distribution was not restricted by UV-B, although very clear, shallow systems are underrepresented. Secondly, the depth at which 1% of surface radiance at 320 nm occurs (Z(320,1%)) was compared with Z(max) in over 1000 aquatic systems in 15 ecozones to determine the proportions of optically clear systems (Z(max) less than or equal to Z(320,1%)) and systems that may become clear (i.e., are "at risk") should DOM decrease by 50%. South of the treeline, <6% of systems were clear, with the exception of two ecozones with 10%-20%. The proportion of systems at risk was 0% in most regions, with 5%-9% in four regions. DOM levels appear adequate to prevent extirpation of sensitive taxa like Daphnia through direct exposure to UV-B in most regions south of the treeline. However, optically clear and at-risk ponds were much more common in the three Artic ecozones, especially the Northern Arctic and Arctic Cordillera.

It is known, however, that a major part of the copper can be bound in complexes that are biologically not available. Natural organic matter, such as humic and fulvic acids, are strong complexing agents that may affect the bioavailable copper (Cu2+) concentration. The aim of this study was to quantify the relation between the concentration of dissolved natural organic matter and free Cull in surface waters, and the biological effect, as measured in a standardized ecotoxicological test (48 h-median effective concentration [EC50] Daphnia magna, mobility). Six typical Dutch surface waters and an artificial water, ranging from 0.1 to 22 mg/L dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were collected and analyzed quarterly. Chemical speciation modeling was used as supporting evidence to assess bioavailability. The results show clear evidence of a linear relation between the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (in milligrams DOC/L) and the ecotoxicological effect (as effect concentration, EC50, expressed as micrograms Cu/L): 48-h EC50 (Daphnia, mobility) = 17.2 X DOC + 30.2 (r(2) = 0.80, n = 22). Except for a brook with atypical water quality characteristics, no differences were observed among water type or season. When ultraviolet (UV)-absorption (380 nm) was used to characterize the dissolved organic carbon, a linear correlation was found as well. The importance of the free copper concentration was demonstrated by speciation calculations: In humic-rich waters the free Cull concentration was estimated at approximate to10(-11) M, whereas in medium to low dissolved organic carbon waters the [Cu2+] was 10(-10) M. Speciation calculations performed for copper concentrations at the effective concentration level (where the biological effect is considered the same) resulted in very similar free copper concentrations (approximate to10(-8) M Cu) in these surface waters with different characteristics. These observations consistently show that the presence of organic matter decreases the bioavailability, uptake, and ecotoxicity of copper in the aquatic environment. It demonstrates that the DOC content must be included in site-specific environmental risk assessment for trace metals (at least for copper). It is the quantification of the effects described that allows policy makers to review the criteria for copper in surface waters.				van Hattum, Bert/N-1706-2013													0730-7268					DEC	2004	23	12					2971	2980		10.1897/03-501.1						WOS:000225680500024	15648773	
J	Simjouw, JP; Mulholland, MR; Minor, EC				Simjouw, JP; Mulholland, MR; Minor, EC			Changes in dissolved organic matter characteristics in Chincoteague Bay during a bloom of the pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens	ESTUARIES												Aureococcus anophagefferens, the pelagophyte responsible for brown tide blooms, occurs in coastal bays along the northeast coast of the United States. This species was identified in Chincoteague Bay, Maryland, in 1997 and has bloomed there since at least 1998. Time series of dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and characteristics are presented for two sites in Chincoteague Bay: one that experienced a brown tide bloom in 2002 and one that did not. Characteristics of the bulk DOM pool were obtained using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) measurements (spectral slope and specific UV absorbance). High molecular weight DOM (HMW-DOM) was characterized in terms of DOC concentration, carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio, isotopic signature, and molecular-level characteristics as determined by direct temperature resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS). Compositional changes in the DOM pool are associated with brown tide blooms, although a direct relationship between DOM characteristics and bloom development could not be confirmed. DOC measurements suggest that during the brown tide bloom, HMW-DOM was released into the surface water. UV-Vis analysis on the bulk DOM and molecular-level characterization of the HMW-DOM using DT-MS show that this material was optically active and more aromatic in nature. Based upon C: N ratio and HMW-DOC measurements, it appears that this HMW-DOM was more nitrogen enriched. Whether this material was released as exudates or was due to lysis of A. anophagefferens could not be determined.

J	Young, KC; Maurice, PA; Docherty, KM; Bridgham, SD				Young, KC; Maurice, PA; Docherty, KM; Bridgham, SD			Bacterial degradation of dissolved organic matter from two northern Michigan streams	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												This study used high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) to measure the changes in molecular weight distributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of two Northern Michigan streams following inoculation with bacterial concentrates from the same locations. During the initial 12 h of the experiment, weight average molecular weight (M-w) of DOM decreased, as high molecular weight components were lost from solution. After 12 h, the Mw of DOM increased, primarily because of a loss of intermediate to lower molecular weight components. Leucine incorporation showed little or no bacterial metabolism during the first 12 h, but metabolism increased substantially after 12 h. The initial loss of high molecular weight components during the period of little or no bacterial metabolism suggests preferential adsorption of these components to the bacterial surfaces, perhaps followed by metabolism. This suggested interpretation is consistent with previous observations of preferential adsorption of higher molecular weight components to viable but non-metabolizing Bacillus subtilis and to mineral surfaces. The latter loss of lower molecular weight components was most likely due to bacterial metabolism of the DOM, which is consistent with previous observations that lower molecular weight components are more biodegradable. The HPSEC technique uses 254 nm wavelength for detection and focuses primarily on humic- and fulvic-type components rather than low molecular weight organic molecules, such as carbohydrates. Thus, results confirmed that humic/fulvic components are biodegradable, but did not address other DOM components.																	0149-0451					DEC	2004	21	8					521	528		10.1080/01490450490888208						WOS:000225711700004

The fluorescence properties with the excitation-emission matrix in the water of Lake Fuxian are different from those in the river water. The differences in these properties between the lake and river water could arise not only from their sources but also from the reactivity of the photobleaching of DOM. In the lake, the supplying of allochthonous fluorescent materials from inflowing rivers to the fluorescent DOM is less significant than the photobleaching of fluorescent substances.																	1439-8621					DEC	2004	5	3					155	163		10.1007/s10201-004-0130-9						WOS:000225778000004

Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a "soft" ionization technique that ionizes polar compounds from aqueous solution prior to injection into a mass spectrometer. The highest resolution and mass accuracy of compounds within NOM have been achieved when ESI is combined with an ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometer such as the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). With this technique, individual molecules within a variety of natural organic mixtures can be detected and their elemental composition can be determined. At low mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio, the resolution is high enough to assign exact molecular formulas allowing specific components of these mixtures to be identified. In addition to molecular identification, we can now use ESI FT-ICR MS to examine molecular-level changes in different organic mixtures as a function of relevant geo-processes, such as microbial alterations and photochemistry. Here we present the results from the application of ESI FT-ICR MS to two geochemical questions: (1) the effect of photoirradiation on the molecular composition of fulvic acids and (2) the role of protozoan grazers in the modification of DOM in aquatic systems.

MARINE CHEMISTRY					Symposium on New Approaches in Marine Organic Biogeochemistry held in Honor of the Life and Science of John I Hedges	AUG 28-30, 2003	Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab, San Juan Isl, WA		Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab			The transfer of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) out of the surface ocean where it is produced to storage in the ocean's interior creates one of the largest reservoirs of reduced carbon and organic nitrogen on earth. In nutrient-depleted surface waters of the oligotrophic ocean, dissolved nitrogenous material is of key importance as a source of fixed nitrogen for heterotrophic organisms. Recent work has increasingly indicated that, contrary to previous ideas, recalcitrant chemical structure is not the central factor underlying the preservation of DOC and DON, leaving the major preservation mechanisms largely unknown. We employ here a stable isotopic approach to examine the metabolic source and transformation signatures imprinted in carbon isotopic fractionation patterns of amino acids, which are the major components of both particulate and dissolved organic nitrogen that can be identified at the molecular level. Compound-specific isotopic signatures from central Pacific particulate and dissolved organic matter indicate a profound difference in processing histories between these two material pools. Sinking particles show a clear imprint of heterotrophic resynthesis and alteration, while the much larger and older dissolved pool retains an unaltered signature of photoautotrophic synthesis, even in samples from the abyssal ocean. In addition, delta(13)C signatures of enantiomers of alanine (D vs. L) in dissolved materials are indistinguishable. This isotopic data, in light of previously observed abundant D-amino acids in oceanic DOM, suggests that autotrophic prokaryotes may be a main source for dissolved nitrogenous material preserved over long time scales in the sea. Taken together, our results suggest that dissolved organic nitrogen preservation is not predominantly linked to heterotrophic reworking and resynthesis, but instead there exists a non-discriminating and rapid shunt, effectively removing recently formed autotrophic biomolecules from further recycling.

J	Amon, RMW; Meon, B				Amon, RMW; Meon, B			The biogeochemistry of dissolved organic matter and nutrients in two large Arctic estuaries and potential implications for our understanding of the Arctic Ocean system	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Symposium on New Approaches in Marine Organic Biogeochemistry held in Honor of the Life and Science of John I Hedges	AUG 28-30, 2003	Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab, San Juan Isl, WA		Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab			The discharge, composition, and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nutrients was investigated in two of the largest Arctic rivers, Yenisei and Ob, in order to assess their role for the biogeochemistry of the Kara Sea, and the potential of terrestrial DOM as tracer for the Arctic Ocean. Ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) from the two river-estuary systems was characterized by high C/N ratios (34-49), depleted delta(13)C values (<-26.5parts per thousand), depleted delta(15)N values (1.8-4.2parts per thousand), and enriched Delta(14)C values (84-307parts per thousand). The distribution of DOM and its chemical properties indicated no major loss processes during estuarine mixing but showed considerable variability between the rivers and years, suggesting a variable input of plankton-derived DOM. The input of plankton-derived DOM was reflected in elevated neutral sugar yields, decreased C/N ratios, but variable delta(13)C values. In contrast, delta(15)N values appear to be more reliable indicators to distinguish terrestrial from plankton-derived DOM in this estuarine system. Based on delta(15)N values, we estimate that between 6% and 16% of the DOM in the river and estuaries is of plankton origin. Clear differences were found in the chemical composition of DOM size fractions. Plankton-derived DOM was more abundant in the higher molecular weight fractions whereas terrestrial-derived DOM dominated the lower molecular weight fraction. This suggests a more heterogeneous origin of DOM than is revealed from looking at the composition of the bulk DOM. Photooxidation experiments indicated the potential photoreactivity of river DOM from those rivers. Compiling the information from this study with previous studies indicates that river input of DOM and nutrients is not the main driver of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the Kara Sea ecosystem. Consistent with previous reports, we found the terrestrial fraction of river DOM to be largely conservative in the estuaries underscoring the potential of terrestrial DOM as a tracer in the Arctic Ocean, especially when combined with standard hydrographic measurements.

Yet few studies have quantified this contribution in agricultural soils. In this study we leached DOM from a. sandy loam and sandy clay loam soil under either grassland or arable cropping. Two weeks after DOM removal microbial respiration from soils was not altered. However, a significant (P<0.05) decline in microbial biomass-N, potentially mineralizable-N, gross N mineralization and gross nitrification occurred after leaching. This data illustrate that whilst DOM is a small component of the soil OM it contributed up to 25% of microbial N supply within these agricultural soils. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wigton, A; Kilduff, JE				Wigton, A; Kilduff, JE			Modeling trichloroethylene adsorption by activated carbon preloaded with natural dissolved organic matter using a modified IAST approach	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A model was developed, using an approach based on the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST), to predict trichloroethylene (TCE) adsorption by granular activated carbon (GAC) preloaded with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from three surface water sources. The IAST model was formulated for a bi-solute system in which TCE and DOM single-solute uptakes were described by the Langmuir-Freundlich and Freundlich isotherms, respectively. The effect of DOM molecular size and polarity (as measured by XAD 8 resin fractionation) on TCE uptake by preloaded GAC was assessed to identify a reactive fraction of natural water DOM for the purpose of modeling competitive adsorption. Consistent with previous work that identified low molecular weight species as the most reactive with regard to preloading effects (i.e., reducing target compound uptake), the low molecular weight components of the polar (hydrophilic) and nonpolar (hydrophobic) DOM fractions, isolated using ultrafiltration (1 kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane), exhibited significant competitive effects. Furthermore, the effects of these fractions on TCE uptake were similar; therefore, they were considered together to represent a single "reactive fraction" of DOM. On the basis of this finding, isotherms for the <1 kDa low molecular weight DOM fraction of the whole water were measured, and molar concentrations were computed based on an average molecular weight determined using size-exclusion chromatography. The IAST model was modified to incorporate surface area reduction due to pore blockage by DOM and to reflect the hypothesis that TCE molecules can access adsorption sites which humic molecules cannot, thus preventing competition on these sites. The model was calibrated with data for TCE uptake by carbon preloaded with the <1 kDa low molecular weight DOM fraction and was verified by predicting TCE uptake by carbon preloaded with whole natural waters for both constant GAC dose (hence constant DOM loading) and variable GAC dose (hence variable DOM loading) TCE isotherms. Preloading by DOM reduced volume in GAC pores having widths smaller than 1.25 nm (likely accessible only to TCE) to a greater extent than total pore volume, suggesting preferential blockage of micropores. Such preferential pore blockage may explain, in part, why increased DOM loading decreases the fraction of the total surface area on which no competition between TCE and DOM occurs.																	0013-936X					NOV 15	2004	38	22					5825	5833		10.1021/ees049676a						WOS:000225272100005	15573579	
J	Chin, YP; Miller, PL; Zeng, LK; Cawley, K; Weavers, LK				Chin, YP; Miller, PL; Zeng, LK; Cawley, K; Weavers, LK			Photosensitized degradation of bisphenol a by dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The direct and indirect photolysis of bisphenol A (BPA) was investigated using a solar simulator in the absence and presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). BPA degradation by direct photolysis was significantly slower than its rate in the presence of DOM. In natural waters, the direct photolytic pathway would be even less important due to light screening effects. Surprisingly, differences in the rate of indirect BPA photolysis were relatively small between DOM samples. Two of the DOM samples represented terrestrial (Suwannee River fulvic acid) and autochthonous (Lake Fryxell) geochemical endmembers. The third DOM (Fulton County, Ohio) was derived from a temperate artificial wetland. We were unable to correlate BPA photoreactivity to the structural components of DOM or its extinction coefficient at 280 nm. The addition of methanol, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, to reaction solutions slowed but did not completely quench the indirect photolysis of BPA. This observation suggests that BPA photodegrades via multiple pathways involving other transients formed by the photolysis of DOM. Competitive experiments using 2,4,6-trimethylphenol also reduce the reaction rate of BPA by DOM and imply that other DOM-derived phototransients (e.g., excited triplet state DOM) are involved in the reaction. The reaction rate coefficients reported under solar-simulated irradiance in the presence of DOM are significantly faster than those reported for the microbial degradation of BPA. Thus, in natural surface waters photosensitized transformation of BPA by dissolved organic matter may be as important as biodegradation.																	0013-936X					NOV 15	2004	38	22					5888	5894		10.1021/es0496569						WOS:000225272100012	15573586	
J	Peuravuori, J; Pihlaja, K				Peuravuori, J; Pihlaja, K			Preliminary study of lake dissolved organic matter in light of nanoscale supramolecular assembly	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Large-scale preparative high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was performed to separate different molecular size fractions in milligram quantities from strongly colored dissolved organic matter (DOM) of a freshwater using a very mild conjugate acid-base pair (10 mM acetic acid-sodium acetate solution at pH 7.0 with an ionic strength of 6 x 10(-5)) as the mobile phase. The homogeneity-uniformity of different molecular size fractions in relation to their combined original mixture was verified by an analytical HPSEC system. In addition to molecular size distribution and basic spectroscopic characteristics, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was applied to specify structural features for different size fractions. The results demonstrate clearly that only a very small amount of conjugate organic acid-base pair is required to generate a powerful resolution for a DOM mixture, and very strong treatments with organic acids are not necessarily needed to reach a better SEC resolution. Most essential is the combined outcome of different HPSEC experiments and determined structural functionalities which indicate that almost all original DOM solutes are aggregated mixtures consisting of different associations possessing various molecular size ranges, which can be separated from their integrated whole as nearly homogeneous and uniform species. In summary, the present study strongly speaks for the need to direct the research of natural dissolved and colloidal organic carbon more strongly toward a nanoscale study of supramolecular assemblies. More precise knowledge about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structure of dissolved DOM constituents has its essential function, e.g., for environmental protection and utilization of surface waters.

J	Brisco, S; Ziegler, S				Brisco, S; Ziegler, S			Effects of solar radiation on the utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two headwater streams	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The effect of solar radiation on dissolved organic matter (DOM) utilization was studied in 2 contrasting streams in Arkansas, USA, from June 2002 through July 2003. Moores Creek is an agricultural stream with elevated nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Huey Hollow is a forest stream with low nutrient and DOC concentrations. A series of in situ experiments were conducted seasonally in both streams to assess how exposure of DOM to solar radiation impacted its utilization, measured as bacterial production following exposure and subsequent inoculation with whole stream water. Exposure of DOM to solar radiation significantly decreased its utilization during most seasons in both streams. Both streams experienced one period when exposure of DOM significantly increased bacterial production; during these periods, DOM appeared to be the least bioavailable and most photochemically reactive. In spring, ultraviolet absorption coefficients, normalized to DOC concentration, suggested a greater proportion of photoreactive DOM in Huey Hollow. Additionally the delta(13)C signature of DOM (delta(13)C(DOM)) suggested the largest terrestrial input occurred in spring when exposure of DOM significantly increased bacterial production. Both the proportion of photoreactive DOM and delta(13)C(DOM) exhibited little seasonal variation in Moores Creek; however, the relative bioavailability of DOM did vary, suggesting some change in DOM composition. In spring the relative bioavailability of DOM was lowest in Moores Creek, and DOM exposure appeared to have further reduced its bioavailability. Elevated ammonium concentrations at this time suggest photochemically enhanced humification may be an important mechanism influencing DOM cycling, and warrants study in streams impacted by agricultural land use.

Seawater bacteria were incubated over a period of 8 d in size-fractionated, freshwater DOM collected from Randers Fjord, Denmark, during spring (April) and summer (August) of 2001. Three fractions were used: 0.2 mum filtered (<0.2 mum-DOM), >1 kDa (high molecular weight, HMW-DOM) and <1 kDa (low molecular weight, LMW-DOM). The results were compared with parallel control incubations of freshwater bacteria in size-fractionated freshwater DOM and seawater bacteria in size-fractionated seawater DOM. There were few differences in bacterial abundance (BA) and production (BP) within each incubation type in spring, but this was not the case in summer. While the seawater bacteria transplanted into freshwater HMW-DOM performed similarly to those in seawater HMW-DOM, freshwater bacteria in freshwater HMW-DOM exhibited higher BA, BP and bacterial respiration (BR), indicating a difference in the physiological abilities of the seawater bacterial assemblage compared to that of the natural freshwater assemblage. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) varied between 11 and 41% and the highest values were generally in the HMW-DOM size fraction. Comparison of the 'bioavailability' of the DOM predicted from BGE, the amino acid degradation index (DI), dissolved organic carbon degradation rates and the bioavailability index showed that net change in DI of dissolved combined amino acids over the course of an incubation can be a good predictor of most of the other indices. The separation of DOM into molecular weight size fractions resulted in different estimates of bioavailability than would have been predicted from the rates observed in the <0.2 mum-DOM fraction. These results further demonstrate the flexibility of bacteria in their ability to utilize different sources of DOM, and highlight the variability that can be observed when different indices are used to determine the bioavailability of organic matter to heterotrophic bacteria.

The aim of the study was to analyse the removal efficiency of organic matter from wastewater after trickling through columns filled with sand. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to on-line UV, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved nitrogen (DN) detection as well as the analysis of amino acids (AA) and carbohydrates (CH) were employed as analytical tools to investigate structural changes of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). The DOC removal in the columns accounted for about 80% based on the DOC concentration of the influent. The chromatograms gained by DOC detection showed three fractions: 1) colloids and polysaccharides, 2) humic material, and 3) low-molecular-weight compounds. The DOM present in fractions 1 and 3 was removed to a much higher extent (95%, 90%) than the DOM in fraction 2 (54%) indicating ongoing humification processes. At the same time, highly bioavailable organic N compounds were lost, whereas N fractions bound to humic material remained. AA and CH belonged to the bioavailable fraction of the DOM. Despite the considerable variations of the ratios of AA and CH carbon to the DOC, a fairly constant pattern of the relative concentrations of the compounds was found. After acid hydrolysis of the column inflows, the AA pattern was dominated by glycine, alanine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid, and the CH pattern by glucose. The relatively high concentrations of rhamnose and fucose in comparison to arabinose and xylose showed the strong microbial influence on the DOM composition.																	0323-4320					NOV	2004	32	4-5					316	327		10.1002/aheh.200400542						WOS:000225986200006

However, we lack information on how different sources of DOM affect its chemical composition. and how DO-M chemical composition affects retention. We studied seasonal controls on DOM production and chemical controls on retention in soils of a temperate coniferous forest. The O horizon was not usually the dominant source for dissolved organic C (DOC) or N (DON) as has been reported for other sites. Rather, net production of both DOC and DON was often greater in the shallow mineral soil (0-10 cm) than in the O horizon. DOM production in the shallow mineral soil may be from root exudation as well as turnover of fine roots and microflora in the rhizosphere. In the field. the two acid fractions (hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids) dominated the soil solution at all depths. A major portion of net production and removal of total DOC within the soil column was explained by increases and decreases in these fractions. although a shift in chemical composition of DOM between the 0 and mineral soil horizons suggested different origins of DOM in these layers. A larger loss of the free amino fraction to deep soil water at this study site than at other sites suggested lower retention of labile DON. Field DOM removal measurements suggest that field-measured parameters may provide a good estimate for total DOM retained in mineral soil.																	0168-2563					NOV	2004	71	2					197	223		10.1007/s10533-004-8130-8						WOS:000226519400004

Sources of water-borne contaminants, such as nitrate, can be identified by recognition of the characteristics of DOM entrained in the water. In this study, DOM in groundwaters sampled from a dairy/crop production area (Chino Basin, CA) was analyzed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). Results showed that DOM derived from natural soil organic matter has a characteristic resonance at a chemical shift region of 4.0-4.3 ppm, while DOM derived from dairy wastes has a characteristic resonance at a lower chemical shift region of 3.2-3.6 ppm. These signature resonances were then used to distinguish the origins of nitrate in the groundwater. It was found that disposal of dairy wastes on croplands is the primary source of nitrate contamination in groundwater underlying the Chino Basin dairy area. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The sorption constants of PAHs to soil and their binding constants to DOM were derived from basic correlations with K-OW (indicator of hydrophobicity). The kinetic (rate) constants were derived from previously published correlations with K-P (sorption constant). The independently obtained sorption and rate constants were corrected for binding to DOM and were used to predict the breakthrough Curves (BTC) of contaminants in the presence and the absence of DOM. Column results confirmed the independently predicted BTC of PAHs in the presence of DOM that did not sorb to the solid phase, as well as the effect of DOM on the rate of the sorption and desorption processes. These findings confirm the ability to quantitatively describe how DOM facilitates transport of contaminants in the subsurface using independently derived parameters. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Our results demonstrate that, while hydroxyl radical reactions with DOM can be an important process increasing its bioavailability, other photoreactions will cause most of the sunlight-induced increases unless hydroxyl production rates are high (>similar to7 mumol L-1 d(-1)). Low molecular weight carboxylic acids could not account for most of the observed sunlight and hydroxyl-induced increases in DOM bioavailability. Both sunlight and hydroxyl-mediated reactions significantly decreased the bacterial growth efficiency of DOM, indicating that photochemical reactions affect not only the fraction of the total DOM pool available to bacteria on ecologically relevant timescales but also the substrate quality and ultimately the environmental fate of this material. Extrapolation of these results to field conditions suggests that photochemical and biochemical mineralization could be an important sink of DOC and source of bioavailable carbon in the Plum Island estuary during the summer months.

Fluorescence spectroscopy has been proposed as a promising method for characterizing DOM, but few links have been demonstrated between DOM fluorescence and DOM composition or the processes affected by DOM composition. In 28 southern Quebec lakes, tryptophan-like DOM fluorescence (T-FDOM) was found to be a much better descriptor of rates of heterotrophic bacterial metabolism than dissolved organic carbon, describing 52%, 44%, 51%, and 55% of the variability in bacterial production, bacterioplankton respiration, total bacterial carbon consumption, and total plankton community respiration, respectively. In addition, evidence from a series of bacterial regrowth cultures suggests that T-FDOM represents a product of bacterial activity as well as, to a lesser extent, a bioavailable substrate. Our results instead raise the intriguing possibility that T-FDOM concentration reflects a balance between its production and consumption by bacteria. We demonstrate here that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to identify a highly dynamic fraction of DOM related to bacterial metabolism in lakes.

J	Chen, M; Wang, WX; Guo, LD				Chen, M; Wang, WX; Guo, LD			Phase partitioning and solubility of iron in natural seawater controlled by dissolved organic matter	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The phase partitioning and solubility of Fe as well as its relationship with marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) in different natural seawater and phytoplankton cultures were examined using radiotracer and ultrafiltration techniques to better understand Fe biogeochemical cycling and its biological availability in the ocean. Fe solubility in seawaters was related to the filter's cutoff, with the Fe solubility in the <3 x 10(3) amu fraction being about one third of that in the <10 x 10(3) amu filtrate. The Fe solubility decreased from estuarine to coastal to oceanic seawater and then to DOM-free seawater. There was a significant linear relationship between Fe solubility or [FeL] concentration and the dissolved organic carbon concentration for the seawater of different origins tested, suggesting that Fe solubility was largely controlled by the amount of dissolved organic matter. In addition, Fe solubility was significantly enhanced by the presence of fresh phytoplankton exudates, indicating that the nature of organic ligands also plays an important role in controlling the Fe solubility in seawater. Most of the Fe-bound organic ligands were in the size fraction <10 x 10(3) amu and decreased from the estuarine to the coastal and then to the oceanic seawater. Among the standard macromolecular organic compounds examined, siderophores ( deferoxamine mesylate and ferrichrome) showed the highest binding capacity for Fe, and carrageenan (a high molecular weight sulfated acid polysaccharide) also slightly increased Fe solubility. Complexation of organic ligands with Fe appeared to be Fe-specific or Fe preferential. Our results highlight quantitatively the importance of DOM in controlling Fe solubility in seawater. Further studies are needed to elucidate the interrelationship between the biogeochemical cycles of Fe and the chemistry of DOM in the ocean.

Trout were acclimated in either hardwater (similar to1000 muM Ca2+) or softwater (similar to100 muM Ca2+), and DOM was tested at approximately 8 mg C l(-1) using a natural (NOM) and a commercial (AHA) source. Ion transport was evaluated based on kinetics estimates (maximum Na+ uptake rates, J(max),; substrate affinity, K-m) and unidirectional flux measurements (J(in), J(out), J(net)). J(max) was higher and unidirectional flux rates were greater in softwater-acclimated trout. Fish exposed to DOM alone in hardwater exhibited an increased Na+ transport capacity indicated by both the kinetics (67% higher J(max) for AHA) and J(in) measurements (153% higher for AHA and 125% higher for NOM). In softwater, the effects of DOM alone on kinetic parameters and unidirectional flux rates were negligible. Cu2+ affected Na+ uptake by a mixed-type inhibition (both non-competitive and competitive). In hardwater, only Km was increased (i.e., affinity decreased), whereas in softwater, Km was increased and J(max) was decreased, with more marked effects at the higher Cu2+ level. In hardwater, the stimulatory effect of AHA on J(max) persisted even in the presence of 300 mug l(-1) Cu2+ whereas both AHA and NOM prevented the increase in K-m caused by Cu2+, these effects were reflected in J(in) measurements. In softwater, AHA helped to protect against the increased K-m caused by high Cu2+, but there was no protection against the inhibition Of J(max). Unidirectional flux measurements indicated that in softwater, Cu2+ inhibited J(in) at 70 mug l(-1), whereas at 300 mug l(-1) Cu2+, J(out) was also stimulated. Fish were more affected by Cu2+ in softwater, as indicated by the inability to control diffusive losses of Na+ and a reduced ability to take up Na+, but in the presence of DOM, losses were (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In highly productive coastal regions and throughout most of the global ocean, in situ biological production is the major source of CDOM. However, little is known about CDOM composition on the molecular level, and there are only a few reports that link CDOM composition to autochthonous biological sources. Here we report the isolation and characterization of CDOM components from one coastal and two open-ocean sites. Each sample contains a complex mixture of light absorbing (300-400 nm) components, including 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and a suite of novel, polychlorinated biphenyl carboxylic acids that closely resemble polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) of anthropogenic origin. However, the global inventory and isomer distribution of dissolved chlorinated aromatic acids suggest they are derived from in situ biological production rather than anthropogenic contaminants. These novel chlorinated aromatic acids account for a significant amount of CDOM adsorption in the ultraviolet.

J	Baker, A; Spencer, RGM				Baker, A; Spencer, RGM			Characterization of dissolved organic matter from source to sea using fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic matter fluorescence, absorbance and dissolved organic carbon were measured from source to sea in the River Tyne catchment, of similar to2935 km(2) and encompassing areas of contrasting land use. The catchment has three major tributaries: the North Tyne which has good water quality, high dissolved organic carbon concentrations and visible water colour from the high proportion of peat in its upper catchment; the South Tyne which has good water quality with typical riverine dissolved organic carbon concentrations and drains from limestone uplands; and the Derwent, a more urbanized catchment which is increasingly impacted by treated sewage effluent discharges towards its mouth. Thirty sample sites, 23 along the three main tributaries and seven within the estuary, were sampled on six occasions over the period 2002-2003. High absorbance at 340 nm and dissolved organic carbon concentration identify N Tyne waters due to the peaty headwaters, but no downstream trends in these parameters are observed in any of the tributaries, in contrast to the estuary where a rapid decrease is observed in both. Fluorescence in contrast demonstrated downstream trends in both intensity and wavelength, especially in the Derwent as it is increasingly impacted by anthropogenic dissolved organic matter. Elevated protein-like fluorescence intensity also fingerprints sewage effluent within the estuary. The absorbance coefficient at 340 nm was found to have the strongest correlation to dissolved organic carbon concentration, greater than all fluorescence intensity parameters measured. However, fluorescence analysis permits the source of the dissolved organic matter to be determined, and therefore has implications for understanding its fate in estuaries and the ocean.

J	Chen, ZQ; Li, Y; Pan, JM				Chen, ZQ; Li, Y; Pan, JM			Distributions of colored dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic carbon in the Pearl River Estuary, China	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The distributions of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were studied in the Pearl River Estuary from 18 to 26 July 1999 (during the wet season). The highest level of CDOM was found in the fresh water, and lowest in the sea water, indicating the river water is a main source of CDOM in this estuary and may has impact on the optical properties of the South China Sea. However, the CDOM concentration is relatively low compared to the reports from other estuaries in the world. CDOM also did not show a conservative mixing behavior in the Pearl River Estuary. This non-conservative behavior may not be due to removal processes (such as flocculation and photodegradation), but is probably the result of different water mass sources having distinct CDOM composition and optical properties. DOC concentration, contrary to CDOM, varied little with the salinity gradient, leading to a different distribution between CDOM and DOC in the Pearl River Estuary. The absence of a co-variation between CODM with DOC suggests that the contribution of CDOM to DOC is variable and it is probably not feasible to estimate DOC by the remote sensing of CDOM in the Pearl River Estuary.

J	Komada, T; Reimers, CE; Luther, GW; Burdige, DJ				Komada, T; Reimers, CE; Luther, GW; Burdige, DJ			Factors affecting dissolved organic matter dynamics in mixed-redox to anoxic coastal sediments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Mixed-redox (suboxic, or oscillating between oxidizing and reducing conditions) to anoxic marine sediments from the Raritan -New York Bay complex and the Inner New York Bight of the eastern U.S. were studied to investigate the factors controlling the accumulation of pore-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOC increased with depth at each of four study sites, but accumulation was generally limited in the mixed-redox zone relative to the anoxic zone. Humic-like fluorescence intensity also differed between mixed-redox and anoxic zones of the sediment, such that anoxic pore waters were relatively enriched in fluorescent. humic-like compounds. A pore-water DOC model was tested for its capacity to explain these geochemical patterns. Model results for a heavily irrigated and a non-bioturbated site both suggest that, excluding the uppermost few cm of the sediment column, pore-water DOC is predominantly comprised of poorly-reactive material with estimated degradation rate constants on the order of 10(-3) yr(-1). Model results are also consistent with the suggestion that DOC accumulation is suppressed in the mixed-redox compared to the anoxic zones of the sediment due to rapid oxidation of high-molecular-weight DOC, and limited production and enhanced oxidation of the less reactive polymeric low-molecular-weight component of the DOC pool. An assessment of sorptive behavior of DOC in the surface sediments of the study area suggests that sorption can influence pore-water DOC distributions under conditions of high sedimentation and low bioirrigation.

The exudation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during incubation was also measured. Total carbohydrates and polyphenols in the exudates and the regional seawater were determined and fractionated into low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) species. Net production rates varied significantly, being highest during the growth phase (March), while respiration rates did not vary significantly. The exudation rates correlated with the plant strategy of growth and production in which high requirements for growth led to a lower proportion of fixed carbon being exuded. More fixed carbon was exuded during the non-growth phase. The annual exudation of DOC is estimated to be similar to26% of fixed carbon and amounts to similar to1.29 kgCm(-2) y(-1). The annual amount of carbon retained by the kelp (the difference between fixed and exuded carbon), assumed to contribute to growth, corresponds to a biomass increase of 3.0 kgC m(-2) y(-1), a value similar to those reported using direct measurements of biomass increase in the region. Carbohydrate concentrations in the exudates were lower during March than in other months, in accordance with the plant growth strategy: Phenols, on the other hand, which are assumed to function as predator deterrent, showed no significant variations in the exudate. The fraction is dominated by carbohydrates while phenols occurred mainly in the LMW fractions.																	0025-3154					OCT	2004	84	5					887	894		10.1017/S002531540401015Xh						WOS:000225063700005		
J	Stabenau, ER; Zika, RG				Stabenau, ER; Zika, RG			Correlation of the absorption coefficient with a reduction in mean mass for dissolved organic matter in southwest Florida river plumes	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					Results are presented from an investigation of the relationship between molecular mass distribution and optical properties for colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM); a complex assembly of organic macromolecules of marine and freshwater origin found throughout the surface ocean. Unique data are derived from the application of a new technique, a combination of a hydrophilic-lipophilic copolymer-based solid phase extraction (SPE) with electrospray ionization (ESI) continuous flowing ion trap mass spectrometry (cf-MS), for the direct determination of CDOM mass distribution. An evaluation of this copolymer-based extraction technique for the analysis of Suwannee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM) reference material revealed that the current method compares favorably with C-18 modified silica or XAD resin-based extraction methods reported in the literature when considering extraction efficiency or low extraction bias for CDOM. The mass distribution of CDOM in several freshwater to marine transition zones along coastal southwestern Florida has been determined with this technique. All rivers in the study region had a bimodal distribution of masses. A case study of the Caloosahatchee River outflow CDOM mass distribution data are presented as an example of the modification in mass distributions. The lower mass mode of the bimodal distribution was observed to have a relatively stable mean throughout the study region at 406 +/- 9 Da, while decreasing in concentration in a non-conservative manner with salinity. In contrast, the upper mass mode of the bimodal distribution was observed to have a variable mean, reaching 1408 Da in the least saline waters and decreasing by 174 Da through the transect toward higher salinity coastal waters. Coinciding with this reduction in mean mass for the upper distribution is a non-conservative reduction in concentration when compared with salinity. We define apparent organic carbon (AOC) as a function of the cf-MS determined total integrated area and use this value to determine concentration of the total extracted CDOM. Unique correlations between the CDOM fluorescence (350-nm excitation/450-nm emission) and the AOC for these coastal samples have been observed for each of three rivers in the study region. The steepest slope and highest correlation between optical and mass spectral properties are observed in rivers with strongly absorbing waters originating in the Florida Everglades and lowest in rivers draining clearer waters from widely variable and anthropogenic influenced regions. The trends in molecular mass distribution and corresponding optical properties support the theory that CDOM in coastal zones is environmentally processed material from terrestrial sources. Probable cause of the reduction in mean mass and suggestions for further investigation of sources and transformations of CDOM are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Twardowski, MS; Boss, E; Sullivan, JM; Donaghay, PL				Twardowski, MS; Boss, E; Sullivan, JM; Donaghay, PL			Modeling the spectral shape of absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					A single exponential model of the form ag(lambda) alpha e(-s,lambda) was evaluated in the context of its application and interpretation in describing absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), a(g), as a function of wavelength, lambda. The spectral slope, s(e), is often used as a proxy for CDOM composition, including the ratio of fulvic to humic acids and molecular weight. About three-quarters of the variability in s(e) values from the literature could be explained by the different spectral ranges used in each study. Dependency on different spectral ranges resulted from the relatively weak performance of the single exponential as a descriptor of a(g)(lambda) in comparison to other models that allow for greater spectral curvature. Consequently, actual variability in the spectral shape of absorption, and thus the composition of CDOM, from widely varying water types appears less than currently thought. The usefulness of five other models in describing CDOM absorption spectra in the visible domain was also evaluated. Six data sets collected with an ac9 in-situ spectrophotometer from around the coastal United States were used in the analysis. All models considered performed better than the conventional single exponential model, with the exception of a double exponential model, where the second exponential term contributed little new information in the fit. Statistically, the most "useful" model (judged by an analysis of variance) in the visible range was a hyperbolic model of the form: a(g)(lambda)alphalambda(-sh). Although the hyperbolic model was less dependent on the spectral range used in the fit, some dependency remained. The most representative model for describing a(g)(lambda) from the six regions considered in this study, with a(g) at 412 nm as input, was: a(g)(lambda)=a(g)(412)(lambda/412)(-6.92). This spectral relationship may be suitable for remote sensing semi-analytical models which must compute a spectrum from a single estimate of CDOM absorption in the blue derived from a remotely sensed water-leaving radiance signal.

J	Chen, RF; Gardner, GB				Chen, RF; Gardner, GB			High-resolution measurements of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River plume regions	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was measured in the spring and summer in the northern Gulf of Mexico with the ECOShuttle, a towed, instrumented, undulating vehicle. A submersible pump mounted on the vehicle supplied continuously flowing, uncontaminated seawater to online instruments in the shipboard laboratory and allowed discrete samples to be taken for further analysis. CDOM in the northern Gulf of Mexico was dominated by freshwater inputs from the Mississippi River through the Birdfoot region and to the west by discharge from the Atchafalaya River. CDOM was more extensively dispersed in the high-flow period in the spring but in both time periods was limited by stratification to the upper 12 m or so. Thin, subsurface CDOM maxima were observed below the plume during the highly stratified summer period but were absent in the spring. However, there was evidence of significant in situ biological production of CDOM in both seasons. The Mississippi River freshwater end member was similar in spring and summer, while the Atchafalaya end member was significantly higher in the spring. In both time periods, the Atchafalaya was significantly higher in CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than the Mississippi presumably due to local production and exchange within the coastal wetlands along the lower Atchafalaya which are absent along the lower Mississippi. Nearshore waters may also have higher CDOM due to outwelling from coastal wetlands. High-resolution measurements allow the differentiation of various water masses and are indicative of rapidly varying (days to weeks) source waters. Highly dynamic but conservative mixing between various freshwater and marine end members apparently dominates CDOM distributions in the area with significant in situ biological inputs (bacterial degradation of phytoplankton detritus), evidence of flocculation, and minor photobleaching effects also observed. It is clear that high-resolution measurements and adaptive sampling strategies allow a more detailed examination of the processes that control CDOM distributions in river-dominated systems.

Large-scale temporal and spatial variability in CDOM concentration and optical properties were observed in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in June of 2000 and April of 2001. Terrestrial CDOM from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers dominates the region. Although the primary factor controlling CDOM in this region is the quantity of fresh water runoff, strong regional variability in fresh water sources also plays a major role. Physical complexity due to changes in circulation patterns, volume of river flow and multiple river sources makes observation of biological and photochemical effects challenging in this region. We have used two approaches to distinguish between source and transformation effects: mixing models, which include the concentration and inherent optical properties,of CDOM from discrete samples, and high-resolution three-dimensional mapping of multi-spectral fluorescence.

J	Del Vecchio, R; Blough, NV				Del Vecchio, R; Blough, NV			Spatial and seasonal distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic carbon in the Middle Atlantic Bight	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					Spatial and seasonal distributions of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption, fluorescence (excited at 355 nm; F-n) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in coastal waters of the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) were acquired. A linear relationship was observed between CDOM absorption at 355 nm [a(CDOM)(355)] and F-n on the shelf of the MAB (a(CDOM)(355) less than or equal to 1 m(-1)), but this relationship curved downward for higher a(CDOM)(355) and F-n values in the Chesapeake Bay (CB) and the Delaware Bay (DB) source waters (a(CDOM)(355) greater than or equal to 1 m(-1)), suggesting the presence of different end members with higher F-n/a(CDOM)(355) ratios, the occurrence of a photochemical/biological processing of the CDOM as it moves down the estuaries or the involvement of both of these processes. Strong evidence was acquired for the photobleaching of CDOM in the surface waters of the MAB during summertime stratification, as indicated by the highly nonlinear dependence of a(CDOM)(355) and F-n on salinity in surface waters, the concomitant increase of the CDOM spectral slope parameter (S) and the much lower ratio of a(CDOM) to DOC (a(CDOM)/DOC) observed in surface waters. The a(CDOM)/DOC ratio decreased by over an order of magnitude with increasing salinity, owing primarily to two reasons: (1) the substantial photobleaching of CDOM in the surface waters of the shelf and (2) the very different content of CDOM and DOC in the freshwater and oceanic end members. These results indicate that CDOM represents only a small portion of the DOC pool in offshore waters and that the sources and sinks of CDOM and DOC are uncoupled despite the often-observed correlation between CDOM and DOC in the coastal environment.

Measurements of CDOM and DOC suggest multiple sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the low-salinity region of the estuary, due to the mixing of four freshwater outlets, Humen, Jiaomen, Honqimen and Hengmen, all with different freshwater endmembers and all flowing into the head of the Lingdingyang. Our 2002 cruise expanded efforts to characterize these four major outlets, allowing for the quantification of CDOM inputs within this complex watershed. DOC and CDOM appear conservative in mid-salinity (5-20) waters, suggesting that mixing dominates production and removal processes over time scales on the order of 3 days, the residence time of water in this region of the estuary. DOC and fluorescence are linearly correlated in the mid-salinity region of the estuary north of Shenzhen, suggesting that in this region, terrestrial inputs dominate both signals. However, this relationship does not continue out onto the shelf, where water masses of differing optical properties mix. The CDOM/DOC ratio decreases with increasing salinity as would be expected through phototrasformation of CDOM into non-fluorescent DOC. Additionally, this ratio at low salinity appears to vary seasonally, with a higher value in Spring (high flow) compared to Fall (low flow). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The plume was characterized by strong surface gradients of salinity, temperature, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence (F-CDOM). The drifters initially headed west and attained peak speeds of 1 m s(-1) within 5 h after release. Thereafter, velocity decreased as the triad headed north in the Louisiana Bight. Linear relationships between F-CDOM and salinity identified two subsurface sources of high salinity water (salinity >35) underlying the surface plume. The platforms stalled in a surface front about 40 h after deployment, and then slowly drifted south along the eastern perimeter of the plume. Shoreward of the plume front there were patches of low-salinity, high F-CDOM 'patches' of surface waters that likely originated in the marshes, bayous, and other smaller distributaries of the delta.

Complex mixing, photodegradation, and biological processes make differentiation of the specific sources of CDOM difficult. Using a combination of high resolution in situ observations on an undulating vehicle, the ECOShuttle, a pumping system mounted on the vehicle, and detailed chemical and biological analyses of discrete samples allowed us to characterize two specific sources of CDOM in the Louisiana Bight: the river water constrained in the upper 12 m of the Mississippi River plume and several subsurface layers of CDOM below the plume. The subsurface CDOM maxima were coincident with steep pycnoclines and sometimes with maxima in chlorophyll a fluorescence. Both sources were actively supplying CDOM to the same location by entirely different processes. The subsurface CDOM was more biologically labile and photochemically refractory than the surface CDOM. Optical properties were also different with a relatively higher protein fluorescence and a lower spectral slope coefficient in the subsurface CDOM. The geographical extent of the two sources was determined by three-dimensional mapping of the area, and due to the relatively calm conditions in the summer of 2000, thin layers of CDOM produced in the subsurface were observed throughout the region. While riverine inputs dominated the distribution of CDOM in surface waters <12 m in depth, biological production of CDOM, probably due to the bacterial degradation of phytoplankton produced DOM dominated the subsurface waters.

Selected cultures were treated with amendments including inorganic nutrients, glucose, phytoplankton exudates, and zooplankton excretia. In all experiments, when bacterial biomass increased, CDOM increased during the first week of the experiment, followed by a decrease over a longer period of time. Cultures amended with both glucose and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus produced more CDOM than controls or cultures amended with glucose or inorganic nutrients alone. However, when complex DOM substrates (derived from phytoplankton or zooplankton cultures) were added to seawater cultures, there was a net accumulation of CDOM over the course of the experiments. These data suggest that, in addition to microbial growth, the quality of the substrate plays an important role in net CDOM production. 'New' CDOM produced in culture was spectroscopically similar to CDOM appearing below the surface during summer stratification. The results of the present study support a new paradigm for CDOM in the open ocean, which allows for local origin and significant dynamics. Appreciation of CDOM dynamics will, in turn, add to our understanding of microbial productivity, photochemical rate processes, and ultraviolet radiation availability in the global ocean.

J	Burdige, DJ; Kline, SW; Chen, WH				Burdige, DJ; Kline, SW; Chen, WH			Fluorescent dissolved organic matter in marine sediment pore waters	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in sediment pore waters from contrasting sites in the Chesapeake Bay and along the mid-Atlantic shelf/slope break was studied using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. Benthic fluxes of FDOM were also examined at the Chesapeake Bay sites. The major fluorescence peaks observed in these pore waters corresponded to those observed in the water column. These included peaks ascribed to the fluorescence of humic-like material (peaks A, C and M), as well as protein-like peaks that appear to result from the fluorescence of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine. In these pore waters we also observed a fourth humic-like fluorescence peak (A'). These four humic-like peaks appeared to occur in pairs (peaks A and M in one pair and peaks A' and C in another pair) with near identical emission maxima but different excitation maxima. Peaks A' and C were red shifted relative to peaks A and M. Humic-like fluorescence increased with sediment depth at almost all stations, and was closely correlated with total DOC. This fluorescence appeared to be a tracer for the refractory, relatively low molecular weight pore water DOM that accumulates with depth during sediment diagenesis. Fluorescence-DOC relationships indicated that larger relative amounts of humic-like FDOM were seen in anoxic sediments versus sub-oxic or mixed redox sediments. By extension, these observations suggest that refractory humic-like compounds (in general) are preferentially preserved in sediment pore waters under anoxic conditions. A simple conceptual model is presented here which proposes that different types of organic matter (e.g., marine vs. terrestrial) as well as internal transformations of DOM or FDOM may lead to the occurrence of these humic-like fluorophores. This model is consistent with a wide range of data on FDOM in marine as well as freshwater systems. Protein-like fluorescence showed no coherent depth trends in sediment pore waters, other than the fact that pore water fluorescence intensities were greater than bottom water values. Protein-like fluorescence in pore waters may be associated with refractory DOM, although this observation is somewhat equivocal. In contrast, the results of benthic flux studies suggested that here protein-like fluorescence was associated with reactive DOM intermediates of organic matter diagenesis (e.g., dissolved peptides and proteins) produced near the sediment-water interface. Furthermore, the interplay between transport processes and the depth zonation of DOM cycling in bioirrigated sediments leads to molecular diffusion (rather than bioirrigation) playing a much more important role in transporting protein-like fluorescence out of the sediments. In contrast, bioirrigation dominates sediment-water exchange of humic-like fluorescence (and therefore most DOC in general). Finally, benthic flux studies indicated that sediments represent a source of chromophoric DOM to coastal waters, although further work will be needed to quantify their significance in terms of other known sources of this material (e.g., riverine input, phytoplankton degradation products).

J	Vahatalo, AV; Wetzel, RG				Vahatalo, AV; Wetzel, RG			Photochemical and microbial decomposition of chromophoric dissolved organic matter during long (months-years) exposures	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					Photochemical and microbial decomposition of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was studied at time scales in which terrestrially derived CDOM is transported from many fresh water watersheds to coastal waters. During 70-day exposure, solar radiation decomposed 96% of freshwater CDOM but only 41% of DOC. Apparent quantum yields for photochemical decomposition decreased in proportion to the dose of absorbed photons by CDOM. When apparent quantum yield for photochemical decomposition of CDOM was applied to an optical model, it revealed that solar UV radiation was responsible for 75% and 44% of the decomposition of CDOM at the surface and in the whole water column, respectively. The modeled rates of photochemical decomposition were in good agreement with the measurements in a 2-m deep photolytic stratum. The photochemical decomposition of CDOM attenuated in the water column similarly to violet-blue irradiance. During 500-day long incubations in darkness, plankton decomposed CDOM as much as was decomposed at the surface by solar radiation in a week. Thus, solar radiation was much more important than plankton in the decomposition of CDOM at the surface. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	McNamara, CJ; Leff, LG				McNamara, CJ; Leff, LG			Response of biofilm bacteria to dissolved organic matter from decomposing maple leaves	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Stream bacteria play an important role in the utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from leaves, and in transfer of this DOM to other trophic levels. Leaf leachate is a mixture of labile, recalcitrant, and inhibitory compounds, and bacterial communities vary in their ability to utilize leachate. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of DOM from sugar maple leaves on bacterial populations in biofilms on decomposing leaf surfaces. Populations of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Burkholderia cepacia, and Pseudomonas putida were enumerated on decomposing maple leaves in a northeast Ohio stream using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Additionally, artificial substrata consisting of PVC-end caps filled with agar supplemented with leaf leachate an covered with cellulose filters were used to determine bacterial response to leachate from leaves at different stages of decomposition. Population sizes of bacterial species exhibited different responses. Leachate did not affect A. calcoaceticus. B. cepacia was tolerant of phenolic compounds released from leaves and the population size increased when DOM concentrations were greatest. In contrast, P. putida was inhibited by phenolic components of leachate when total DOM concentrations were greatest. Differences in response of the bacterial species to components of leaf leachate indicate the complexity of microbial population dynamics and interactions with DOM. Differences among species in response to DOM have the potential to influence transport and retention of organic matter in stream ecosystems.																	0095-3628					OCT	2004	48	3					324	330		10.1007/s00248-003-1058-z						WOS:000225869200004	15692852

J	Kramer, GD; Herndl, GJ				Kramer, GD; Herndl, GJ			Photo- and bioreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter produced by marine bacterioplankton	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The major source of oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) is organic compounds from phytoplankton released either directly during photosynthesis or via grazing. Bacterioplankton as a source of marine DOM have received considerably less attention. We determined the production of DOM during active bacterial growth in batch cultures with artificial seawater amended with glucose and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. During the initial growth of bacterioplankton, the fluorescence of bacterial-derived DOM increased steadily indicating release of chromophoric DOM. This bacterial-derived DOM was relatively rich in N and depleted in P as indicated by the C:N:P ratio of 147:29: 1. Exposure of this bacterial-derived DOM to artificial solar radiation provoked a rapid decline in fluorescence indicating its photoreactivity. Re-growth experiments with natural bacterial assemblages inoculated into the solar radiation-exposed bacterial-derived DOM indicated that the bioavailability remained essentially unaltered, i.e. is refractory to bacterial utilization. Our findings indicate that bacterioplankton release chromophoric, refractory DOM during active growth and that this DOM, albeit being photoreactive does not stimulate bacterial growth activity upon exposure to solar radiation.

Copper sorption capacity decreased for all soils in the presence of DOC, and more so in the calcareous soil (C). In the Calcaric Cambisol and the Eutric Fluvisol, less Cu was desorbed in the presence of DOC, than in the acidic soils. As the pH increased, the decrease in Cu sorption due to interaction with DOC was more marked. Conversely, without addition of DOC, Cu sorption increased with pH. Freundlich type equations described well Cu sorption (R-2 > 98%). Copper was mainly specifically adsorbed and bonded to the fulvic acid fraction of DOC.

J	Pullin, MJ; Progess, CA; Maurice, PA				Pullin, MJ; Progess, CA; Maurice, PA			Effects of photoirradiation on the adsorption of dissolved organic matter to goethite	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The effects of photoirradiation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on its subsequent adsorption to the Fe(III)oxyhydroxide mineral goethite were investigated at 22degreesC in 0.10 mol L(-1) NaClO(4) solutions at pH 3.5 and 5.5, Photoirradiation of DOM decreased the abundance of high molecular-weight components and formed new lower molecular-weight components, including low molecular weight carboxylic acids (i.e., formic, malonic, and acetic acids). Adsorption of non-irradiated DOM decreased from pH 3.5 to 5.5 and was dominated by the intermediate molecular weight (1251-3750 Da) fraction, although the 451-1250 and 3751-11350 Da fractions also contributed to adsorption at pH 3.5. Irradiation resulted in a substantial decrease in DOM adsorption affinity at pH 3.5, primarily due to loss of components in the 1251-3750 and 3751-11350 Da fractions. Irradiation resulted in only a small decrease in DOM adsorption affinity at pH 5.5; the loss of components in the 3751-11350 Da fraction upon irradiation had little effect on adsorption because they played little or no role in the non-irradiated sample at this pH. Irradiation of DOM also affected its interactions with Fe in solution and the solution iron(II)/iron(III) speciation. The combined effects of irradiation followed by adsorption produced DOM that was lower in molecular weight and had a decreased UV-Vis absorptivity than either process, alone. Together, these two processes are likely to have important environmental consequences in terms of UV penetration of surface waters, contaminant mobility, and DOM bioavailability.

We used that situation to test the hypothesis that amounts and properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in small streams draining forested catchments respond to different permafrost regimes. Water samples were taken from eight tributaries along the Yenisei between 67degrees30'N and 65degrees49'N latitude. The samples were analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) and DOM was characterized by its chemical composition (XAD-8 fractionation, sugars, lignin phenols, amino acids, protein, UV and fluorescence spectroscopy), and its biodegradability. Most properties of the tributary waters varied depending on latitude. The higher the latitude, the higher were DOC, DON and the proportion of the hydrophobic fraction of DOC. The contribution of hexoses and pentoses to DOC were higher in southern tributaries; on the other hand, phenolic compounds were more abundant in northern tributaries. Mineralizable DOC ranged between 4% and 28% of total DOC. DOM in northern tributaries was significantly (P<0.05) less biodegradable than that in southern tributaries reflecting the differences in the chemical properties of DOM. Our results suggest that the differences in DOM properties are mainly attributed to differences of permafrost regime, affecting depth of active layer, soil organic matter accumulation and vegetation. Soil organic matter and vegetation determine the amount and composition of DOM produced in the catchments while the depth of the active layer likely controls the quantity and quality of DOM exported to streams. Sorptive interactions of DOM with the soil mineral phase typically increase with depth. The results imply that a northern shift of discontinuous permafrost likely will change in the long term the input of DOM into the Yenisei and thus probably into the Kara Sea.

Plant-derived DOM leachate samples were exposed to photochemical and microbial degradation and the optical, chemical, and molecular weight characteristics measured over time. Optical parameters such as the synchronous fluorescence intensity between 270 and 290 nm (Fnpeak I), a strong indicator of protein and/or polyphenol content, decreased exponentially in all plant leachate samples, with microbial decay constants ranging from -1.0 d(-1) for seagrass to -0.11 d(-1) for mangrove (half-life [t(1/2)] = 0.7-6.3 d). Similar decreases in polyphenol content and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration also occurred but were generally an order of magnitude lower or did not change significantly over time. The initial molecular weight composition was reflected in the rate of Fnpeak I decay and suggests that plant-derived DOM with a large proportion of high molecular weight structures, such as seagrass derived DOM, contain high concentrations of easily microbially degradable proteinaceous components. For samples exposed to extended simulated solar radiation, polyphenol and Fnpeak I photochemical decay constants were on average -0.7 d(-1) (t(1/2) 1.0 d). Our data suggest that polyphenol structures of plant-derived DOM are particularly sensitive to photolysis, whereas high molecular weight protein-like structures are degraded primarily through physical-chemical and microbial processes. Furthermore, microbial and physical processes initiated the formation of recalcitrant, highly colored high molecular weight polymeric structures in mangrove-derived DOM. Thus, partial, biogeochemical transformation of plant-derived DOM from coastal areas is rapid and is likely to influence carbon and nutrient cycling, especially in areas dominated by seagrass and mangrove forests.																	0024-3590					SEP	2004	49	5					1667	1678								WOS:000224979900018

In this study, the quantitative relationships were investigated among O(2) consumption, CO(2) production, and variation of carboxyl content resulting from photooxidation of DOM in natural water samples obtained from the freshwater reaches of the Satilla River and Altamaha River in the southeastern United States. In terms of loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), loss of optical absorbance, and production of CO(2), the rate of photooxidation of DOM was increased in the presence of Fe redox chemistry and with increasing O(2) content. The ratio of photochemical O(2) consumption to CO(2) photoproduction ranged from similar to0.8 to 2.5, depending on the O(2) content,the extent of involvement of Fe, and probably the initial oxidation state of DOM as well. The absolute concentration of carboxyl groups ([-COOH]) on DOM only slightly decreased or increased over the course of irradiation, possibly depending on the stages of photooxidation, while the DOC-normalized carboxyl content substantially increased in the presence of Fe redox chemistry and sufficient O(2). Both the initial [-COOH] and the apparent loss of this quantity over the course of irradiation was too small to account for the much larger production of CO(2), suggesting that carboxyl groups were photochemically regenerated or that the major production pathway for CO(2) did not involve photodecarboxylation. The results from this study can be chemically rationalized by a reaction scheme of (a) photodecarboxylation/regeneration of carboxyl: C(x)H(y)O(z)(COOH)(m) + aO(2) + (metals, hv) --> bCO(2) + cH(2)O(2) + C(x-b)H(y)O(z')(COOH)(m-b)(COOH)(b) or of (b) nondecarboxylation photooxidation: C(x)H(y)O(z)(COOH)(m) + aO(2)+ (metals, hv) --> bCO(2) + cH(2)O(2) + C(x-b)H(y)O(z')(COOH)(m).

J	Kilduff, JE; Mattaraj, S; Belfort, G				Kilduff, JE; Mattaraj, S; Belfort, G			Flux decline during nanofiltration of naturally-occurring dissolved organic matter: effects of osmotic pressure, membrane permeability, and cake formation	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE												Nanofiltration of naturally-occurring dissolved organic matter (NOM) by an aromatic polyamide membrane was measured in a crossflow bench-scale test cell and modeled using a semi-empirical osmotic pressure/cake formation model. Our objective was to examine flux decline due to NOM fouling while explicitly accounting for flux decline due to osmotic effects and changes in membrane permeability. This approach allowed quantification of the effect of ionic composition on specific NOM cake resistance, and yielded insight into flux decline due to enhanced NaCl rejection by the NOM deposit. In the absence of NOM, increasing NaCI concentration reduced salt rejection and decreased membrane permeability. Flux decline was modeled by accounting for changes in osmotic pressure with time, and by employing an effective permeability. The addition of calcium significantly reduced rejection of sodium and feed conductivity, and thus mitigated flux decline. Increasing pH from 4 (near membrane pI) to 10 increased the effective permeability but also increased NaCl rejection, which resulted in greater flux decline. The presence of NOM caused greater flux decline resulting from a combination of NOM cake resistance and increased rejection of NaCl by negatively charged NOM functional groups. Increasing NaCl concentration had little effect on the mass of NOM deposited, but significantly increased the specific resistance of the NOM cake. The effect of ionic strength on specific resistance correlated with a reduction in NOM size, estimated by separate UF permeation experiments and size exclusion chromatography analysis of UF permeate. Therefore, increased specific cake resistance is consistent with a more compact, less porous cake. Flux decline by NOM solutions showed a maximum at pH 7, where salt rejection was also a maximum. Binding of calcium reduced the ability of NOM to enhance NaCl rejection, and likely increased NOM cake resistance. Flux decline caused by NOM fouling in the presence of calcium was only significantly different than that caused by NOM in a solution of NaCI at the same ionic strength when the calcium concentration corresponded to saturation of NOM binding sites.

This slightly stratified estuary is characterized by conservatively mixed dissolved organic carbon (DOC= 200 - 1200 muM C), high river flow, and low biological productivity. Copper speciation data measured using competitive ligand equilibration-cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-CSV with 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ)) for seven Cape Fear estuarine transects revealed that strong (mean detection window alpha(Cu8HQ) = 10(5.2)) Cu-complexing ligands range in concentration from 7 to >200 nM (at fixed K-CuL' = 1013,5), are conservatively mixed below the turbidity maximum zone (S similar to 5), and exist in substantial excess of dissolved Cu levels (3-25 nM). Strong ligand and DOC concentrations exhibited strong linear correlations among transect samples at DOC concentrations < 1000 muM C (r(2) = 0. 93, pmuch less than0.01) and among all size fractions of ultrafiltered estuarine samples (r(2)=0.94, pmuch less than0.01). A 300 muM C solution of Cape Fear River humic substances isolated using C-18 extraction exhibited a strong Cu ligand concentration of 143 nM (at fixed K-CuL' 10(13.5)). Comparison with speciation data from estuarine transects indicates C-18 isolated humics could account for 100% of the typical strong Cu-complexation capacity in the Cape Fear estuary.

Several pathways were available for fipronil photodegradation in this system, including direct photolysis and indirect photooxidation by species produced during the illumination of natural waters (e.g., (NOM)-N-3*, O-1(2)*, (OH)-O-., (CO31-)-C-., (OOR)-O-., (OOH)-O-., e(aq)(-), O-2(.-)). Product studies indicated that fipronil was quantitatively converted to fipronil desulfinyl, a product that is associated with direct photolysis alone. DOM was the only variable that affected fipronil degradation; it decreased the rate of fipronil photodegradation primarily through competitive light absorption (i.e., attenuation) and the quenching of fipronil*. The addition of sodium chloride (30parts per thousand) resulted in a more rapid rate (similar to20%) of fipronil loss in comparison to equivalent experiments performed without sodium chloride, implying that fipronil may be more photolabile in marine environments.

In contrast to bulk soil properties, which are typically slow to respond to a chronic stress, soil solution chemistry may provide an early indication of the long-term changes in soils associated with a chronic stress. At the Harvard Forest, soil solution was collected beneath the forest floor in zero tension lysimeters for 10 years (1993-2002) as part of an N saturation experiment. The experiment was begun in 1988 with 5 or 15 g N m(-2) per year added to hardwood and pine forest plots, and our samples thus characterize the long-term response to N fertilization. Samples were routinely analyzed for inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC); selected samples were also analyzed to determine qualitative changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter. Fluxes of DOC, DON, and inorganic N were calculated based on modeled water loss from the forest floor and observed concentrations in lysimeter samples. The concentration and flux of inorganic N lost from the forest floor in percolating soil solution are strongly affected by N fertilization and have not shown any consistent trends over time. On average, inorganic N fluxes have reached or exceeded the level of fertilizer application in most plots. Concentrations of DOC were unchanged by N fertilization in both the hardwood and pine stands, with long-term seasonal averages ranging from 31-57 mg l(-1) (hardwood) and 36-93 mg l(-1) (pine). Annual fluxes of DOC ranged from 30-50 g m(-2) per year. DON concentrations more than doubled, resulting in a shift toward N-rich organic matter in soil solution percolating from the plots, and DON fluxes of 1-3 g m(-2) per year. The DOC:DON ratio of soil solution under high N application (10-20) was about half that of controls. The organic chemistry of soil solution undergoes large qualitative changes in response to N addition. With N saturation, there is proportionally more hydrophilic material in the total DON pool, and a lower C:N ratio in the hydrophobic fraction of the total DOM pool. Overall, our data show that fundamental changes in the chemistry of forest floor solution have occurred in response to N fertilization prior to initiation of our sampling. During the decade of this study (years 5-14 of N application) both inorganic N and dissolved organic matter concentrations have changed little despite the significant biotic changes that have accompanied N saturation.

The objectives (if this study were to investigate the sorption reaction of dissolved organic matter from aqueous extracts of four crop species, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), red clover (Trijolium pratense L.) and oats (Arena sativa L.) on two soils of different texture and to determine the subsequent effects of sorption on phytotoxicity using a bioassay. Sorption to both a sandy and silty textured soil fit a constant partitioning, isotherm and the affinity constant for sorption were not statistically different between the soils. A bioassay with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings showed that the hairy vetch, crimson clover and red clover extracts were phytotoxic. Reaction with soil for 24 h resulted in the elimination of phytotoxicity of these three crop extracts at the 5% significance level. The sorption of allopathic compounds released from crop residues may limit the expression of allelopathy in the field. However, the initial phytotoxicity after soil incorporation may coincide with the early, critical stage of weed emergence and establishment, indicating that allelopathy may still play a role in weed management despite sorption of the allelopathic compounds to soil surfaces.																	0971-4693					JUL	2004	14	1					13	21								WOS:000224526600002

A multicomponent analysis was used to describe the effects of UV and visible radiation on the optical absorption spectra of two natural water samples, a Suwannee River fulvic acid standard (SRFA) and a Delaware Bay water sample. This analysis used a constrained minimization technique to flit independent spectral components to the observed bleaching behavior of the water samples under monochromatic irradiation. Spectra derived from these fits were used to predict the bleaching behavior of both samples under polychromatic irradiation (lambda > 320 nm). This approach reproduces the kinetics and spectral behavior of polychromatic photobleaching very well at times <48 h, but underpredicts the bleaching at longer time periods.

J	Fu, HB; Quan, X; Liu, ZY; Chen, S				Fu, HB; Quan, X; Liu, ZY; Chen, S			Photoinduced transformation of gamma-HCH in the presence of dissolved organic matter and enhanced photoreactive activity of humate-coated alpha-Fe2O3	LANGMUIR												This study examined phototransformation of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) in different solutions. The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) inhibited the phototransformation of gamma-HCH. This phenomenon could be correlated to the binding interaction between gamma-HCH and DOM. alpha-Fe2O3 promoted the transformation of gamma-HCH. The humate-coated alpha-Fe2O3 revealed a slight, however significant, favorable effect compared to the bare one. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) offered the direct evidence that humate-coated alpha-Fe2O3 could form surface Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes by ligand exchange. Additional experiments demonstrated that the photocorrosion of alpha-Fe2O3 coated by DOM was much more acute than that of the bare one. These combined results suggested that the transformation of gamma-HCH on humate-coated alpha-Fe2O3 is more related to a surface complex and not to a semiconductor-assisted photoreaction. In the humate-coated alpha-Fe2O3, absorption of a photon results in an excited ligand-to-metal charge-transfer state of the complexes, and a rich variety of free radical reactions ensue, which is concurrently accompanied by the dissolution of the iron oxide. Such reactions may generate reactive transients such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, which may be expected to transform gamma-HCH.																	0743-7463					JUN 8	2004	20	12					4867	4873		10.1021/la0364486						WOS:000221846000015	15984243

The DOM samples were previously collected from natural waters at five Nordic sites during fall 1999 and spring 2000, isolated by the reverse osmosis method, and thoroughly characterized. The purpose was to determine the essential characteristics that predict the sorption capacity of DOM for hydrophobic contaminants. DOM isolates were dissolved in artificial freshwater to give a dissolved organic carbon concentration of 15 mg L-1. Partition coefficients (K-DOC) of the model compounds between water and DOM were measured by the equilibrium dialysis method. Further, the bioavailability of BaP and pyrene to Daphnia magna was tested in the presence of DOM with various qualities. A strong negative correlation was found for the K-DOC values of BaP (R = -0.922) and pyrene (R = -0.929) with spectral absorbency ratio (A(254)/A(400)), while the correlation (R = -0.760) was weaker for the K-DOC values of TCB. The K-DOC values for TCB correlated (R = 0.849) strongly with specific visible absorbency (A(600)/TOC), while the K-DOC values for TBDE correlated (R = -0.739) with relative fluorescence emission. Generally, bioavailability of BaP and pyrene to D. magna reflected the measured association of the compounds with DOM. The data emphasize the importance of aromaticity of DOM, estimated by simple spectroscopic methods, in predicting sorption capacity for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The situation with halogenated compounds still remains unclear.																	1015-1621					JUN	2004	66	2					171	177		10.1007/s00027-004-0705-x						WOS:000221932000003

Two shallow nonstratified Estonian lakes - Harku and Karujarv - were investigated. The HPSEC results for pore waters were compared with those obtained by spectroscopic methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy and UV-absorption, and with other analyses carried out on sediments (sediment composition, C/N and H/C ratios). The average molecular weight values for UV absorbing DOM were close to pore waters of the studied lakes, not exceeding 5000 for weight- and 3000 for average-number, respectively. Low MW size fractions (<1000) dominated in Lake Harku pore waters, while the opposite was recorded in Lake Karujarv pore waters. Besides the traditional paleolimnological methods, the method used (HPSEC) seems to be promising in detailed sediment pore water characterization.																	1015-1621					JUN	2004	66	2					185	194		10.1007/s00027-004-0703-z						WOS:000221932000005		
J	Jansen, B; Nierop, KGJ; Verstraten, JM				Jansen, B; Nierop, KGJ; Verstraten, JM			Mobilization of dissolved organic matter, aluminium and iron in podzol eluvial horizons as affected by formation of metal-organic complexes and interactions with solid soil material	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) are generally believed to play a crucial role in the translocation of At and Fe in acid sandy soils. Binding of At and Fe to DOM affects their mobility in soils by altering sorption equilibria of charged sites on solid soil material, inducing precipitation of organo-metallic complexes and preventing the formation of inorganic At and Fe phases. The relative importance of the different processes, especially with respect to the translocation of At, Fe and organic matter in podzols, remains unresolved. We determined the effect of the presence of solid soil material from the eluvial (AhE and AE, respectively) horizons of a Fimic Anthrosol and a Haplic Podzol on the metal-to-organic carbon (M/C) ratio in solution and the formation of dissolved organic At and Fe complexes. Furthermore, we assessed the resulting influence on the mobilization of At, Fe and DOM. Even under considerable metal loading, the M/C ratios and 'free' metal fractions in solution remained low and relatively constant, due to an apparent buffering by the solid phase and the formation of organo-metal complexes in solution. The M/C ratios remained so low that significant precipitation of organo-metal complexes due to saturation with metals was not found. The apparent buffering by the solid phase can be explained by a strong release of organic matter from solid soil material and adsorption of non-complexed At and Fe on solid organic matter upon metal addition. Adsorption of organo-metal complexes most likely played only a minor role. The observations confirm the expected mobilization of At, Fe and DOM in eluvial horizons and seem to indicate that even under fluctuating input of At, Fe and DOM the soil solution will have a constant composition with respect to M/C ratios and percentage of Al and Fe present in dissolved organo-metal complexes.

J	Kalbitz, K; Glaser, B; Bol, R				Kalbitz, K; Glaser, B; Bol, R			Clear-cutting of a Norway spruce stand: implications for controls on the dynamics of dissolved organic matter in the forest floor	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Clear-cutting of forest provides a unique opportunity to study the response of dynamic controls on dissolved organic matter. We examined differences in concentrations, fluxes and properties of dissolved organic matter from a control and a clear-cut stand to reveal controlling factors on its dynamics. We measured dissolved organic C and N concentrations and fluxes in the Oi, Oe and Oa horizons of a Norway spruce stand and an adjacent clear-cutting over 3 years. Aromaticity and complexity of organic molecules were determined by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, and we measured delta(13)C ratios over 1 year. Annual fluxes of dissolved organic C and N remained unchanged in the thin Oi horizon (similar to260 kg C ha(-1), similar to8.5 kg N ha(-1)), despite the large reduction in fresh organic matter inputs after clear-cutting. We conclude that production of dissolved organic matter is not limited by lack of resource. Gross fluxes of dissolved organic C and N increased by about 60% in the Oe and 40% in the Oa horizon upon clear-cutting. Increasing organic C and N concentrations and increasing water fluxes resulted in 380 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 10.5 kg N ha(-1) year' entering the mineral soil of the clear-cut plots. We found numerous indications that the greater microbial activity induced by an increased temperature of 1.5degreesC in the forest floor is the major factor controlling the enhanced production of dissolved organic matter. Increasing aromaticity and complexity of organic molecules and depletion of (13)C pointed to an accelerated processing of more strongly decomposed parts of the forest floor resulting in increased release of lignin-derived molecules after clear-cutting. The largest net fluxes of dissolved organic C and N were in the Oi horizon, yet dissolved organic matter sampled in the Oa horizon did not originate mainly from the Oi horizon. Largest gross fluxes in the Oa horizon (control 282 kg C ha(-1)) and increased aromaticity and complexity of the molecules with increasing depth suggested that dissolved organic matter was derived mainly from decomposition, transformation and leaching of more decomposed material of the forest floor. Our results imply that clear-cutting releases additional dissolved organic matter which is sequestered in the mineral soil where it has greater resistance to microbial decay.

J	Wang, XC; Altabet, MA; Callahan, J; Chen, RF				Wang, XC; Altabet, MA; Callahan, J; Chen, RF			Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter from four US estuaries	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												High molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM) represents an important component of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater and fresh-waters. In this paper, we report measurements of stable carbon (delta(13)C) isotopic compositions in total lipid, total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA), total carbohydrate (TCHO) and acid-insoluble "uncharacterized" organic fractions separated from fourteen HMW-DOM samples collected from four U.S. estuaries. In addition, C/N ratio, delta(13) C and stable nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotopic compositions were also measured for the bulk HMW-DOM samples. Our results indicate that TCHO and THAA are the dominant organic compound classes, contributing 33-46% and 13-20% of the organic carbon in HMW-DOM while total lipid accounts for only <2% of the organic carbon in the samples. In all samples. a significant fraction (35-49%) of HMW-DOM was included in the acid-insoluble fraction. Distinct differences in isotopic compositions exist among bulk samples, the compound classes and the acid-insoluble fractions. Values of delta(13)C and delta(15)N measured for bulk HMW-DOM varied from -22.1 to -30.1parts per thousand and 2.8 to 8.9parts per thousand, respectively and varied among the four estuaries studied as well. Among the Compound classes, TCHO was more enriched in C-13 (delta(13)C = -18.5 to -22.8parts per thousand) compared with THAA (delta(13)C = -20.0 to -29.6parts per thousand) and total lipid (delta(13)C = -25.7 to -30.7parts per thousand). The acid-insoluble organic fractions, in general, had depleted C-13 values (delta(13)C = -23.0 to -34.4parts per thousand). Our results indicate that the observed differences in both delta(13)C and delta(15)N were mainly due to the differences in sources of organic matter and nitrogen inputs to these estuaries in addition to the microbial processes responsible for isotopic fractionation among the compound classes. Both terrestrial sources and local sewage inputs contribute significantly to the HMW-DOM pool in the estuaries studied and thus had a strong influence on its isotopic signatures.

Changes in CDOM absorption and fluorescence were monitored by incubating copepods in rotating bottles for 24 It in the dark with controlled diets. Copepods were fed a range of food concentrations front 800 to 15 000 cells l(-1) of either Thalassiosiro weissflogii and Skeletonema costatum or Prorocentrum minimum in stationary and exponential growth phases. Results front these studies indicate that diet does have all effect on the amount and type of CDOM released by C. finmarchicus. A diet of either diatoms or dinoflagellates in exponential growth will result in a release of humic-like material, while feeding on senescent cells leads to a net input of protein-like material. Only at very high senescent cell concentrations ( >5000 cells 1(-1)) call humic-like material accumulate. This could lead to seasonal cycles in the amount and type of CDOM released by copepods, such that humic-like material will be released in the spring and at the height of phytoplankton blooms, while protein-like material will be added to the water as the bloom dies. The humic-like material found in these studies is blue-shifted compared to the standard humic material (Peaks A, M, and C) measured in seawater. The role of this humic-like material in the environment is currently unknown, but it could be important in absorbing UV radiation. ((C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Our main approach was to mix bacterial communities and water from various locations in the Hudson River and its tributaries, and then to monitor bacterial activity and community structure determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. The locations differed significantly in DOM composition and concentrations, ectoenzyme activity and bacterial community structure. We found that water source and, to a lesser extent, source of the inoculum significantly affected nearly all aspects of bacterial activity and community structure. A common inoculum grown in different waters often led to as much as a 2-fold difference in enzyme activities. When 2 different bacterial communities were inoculated in the same water, community structure and the activity of some ectoenzymes remained different after several days. Other data also pointed to a dependence of ectoenzyme activity on community structure. Activity of several ectoenzymes covaried with the relative abundances of the 4 bacterial groups we examined (alpha-, beta- and gamma-proteobacteria, and Cytophaga-like bacteria); the highest correlation was between beta-proteobacteria and phosphatase activity. In multi-variate regression analyses, community structure explained a significant amount of the variation in rates of all ectoenzymes except 2 proteases. The abundance of Cytophaga-like bacteria was the dominant variable in the regression models for the activity of 3 ectoenzymes. These data suggest that DOM can affect the relative abundance of the major heterotrophic bacterial groups, and that the relative abundance of these groups could have an impact on DOM hydrolysis.																	0948-3055					MAY 19	2004	35	3					243	257		10.3354/ame035243						WOS:000221970000004

Polar DOM was the most abundant DOM fraction, accounting for 56% of the isolated DOM. Colloidal organic matter was C-14-age dated to be about 100% modern carbon and all of the DOM fractions were C-14-age dated to be between 94 and 95% modern carbon. Average structural models of each DOM fraction were derived that incorporated quantitative elemental and infrared, C-13-NMR, and electrospray/mass spectrometric data. The polar DOM model consisted of open-chain N-acetyl hydroxy carboxylic acids likely derived from N-acetyl heteropolysaccharides that constituted the colloidal organic matter. The less polar DOM fraction models consisted of aliphatic alicyclic ring structures substituted with carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, ester, and methyl groups. These ring structures had characteristics similar to terpenoid precursors. All DOM fractions in the Great Salt Lake are derived from algae and bacteria that dominate DOM inputs in this lake.																	0168-2563					MAY	2004	69	1					125	141		10.1023/B:BIOG.0000031044.16410.27						WOS:000221929800007		
J	De Schamphelaere, KAC; Vasconcelos, FM; Tack, FMG; Allen, HE; Janssen, CR				De Schamphelaere, KAC; Vasconcelos, FM; Tack, FMG; Allen, HE; Janssen, CR			Effect of dissolved organic matter source on acute copper toxicity to Daphnia magna	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The protective effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on metal toxicity to aquatic organisms has been reported by numerous authors. Bioavailability models such as the biotic ligand model (BLM) thus account for this factor to predict metal toxicity to aquatic organisms. Until now, however, few attempts have been made to assess the effect of the DOM source on metal speciation and toxicity and, accordingly, on BLM predictions. The aims of this study were to investigate to what extent DOMs differ in their ability to decrease acute copper toxicity to the cladoceran Daphnia magna and to evaluate if ultraviolet (UV) absorbance measurements may be a simple and effective method to incorporate DOM variability into the acute Cu-BLM for D. magna. Acute toxicity tests were carried out in artificial test water enriched with DOMs isolated from six locations in Europe and North America and in seven natural European surface waters. The acute Cu-BLM for D. magna was then used to estimate the copper complexing capacity of each DOM (expressed as % active fulvic acid, %AFA). A factor of 6 difference was observed between the lowest and the highest copper complexing capacity. A significant linear relationship was observed between the UV-absorbance coefficient at 350 nm (delta(350)) and the %AFA. Linking this relationship to the acute Cu-BLM resulted in a significant improvement of the predictive capacity of this BLM. Without accounting for this relationship, 90% of the predicted 48-h 50% effective concentrations (EC50) were within a factor of 2 of the observed EC50s; taking this relationship into account, 90% of the EC50s were predicted with an error of less than factor 1.3. The present study and other studies seem to indicate that UV absorbance may be a good measure of biologically and toxicologically relevant differences in copper binding behavior of DOM.

Data refer to a survey carried out aboard of the R/V Urania in January 2000. The study period was characterized by a rather low river discharge due to the particularly calm meteorological conditions. The river plume region extended to north of the Arno delta and it was confined to the inner shelf with depths less than 40 m and salinities < 38.1. Surface DOC concentrations ranged in a narrow interval of values (56-76 muM). Plume waters exhibited the highest levels of DOC (> 70 muM). These values were slightly higher than those found in the outer shelf (56-66 muM) which in turn, were generally comparable to those reported in the literature for open sea waters of different regions of the Mediterranean Sea. The distribution of CDOM was described by the two components of fluorescent material, i.e., the "protein-like" (F(n(280))) and the "humic-like" (F(n(355))), respectively, characterized by different spectral regions for both excitation and emission. The F(n(355)) Signature decreased towards the north and west generally mirroring the spatial pattern of salinity, temperature and DOC. On the contrary, the distribution of F(s(280)) differed from that of F(n(355)) without any apparent relationship with the parameters above cited. This behavior supports the hypothesis that the "protein-like" fluorescent material could be released to the coastal waters by the local activity of planktonic organisms. Conversely, DOC was conservatively exported through the plume to the coastal waters and, similarly, F(n(355)) appeared largely controlled by a conservative mixing. The correlation between DOC and F(n(355)) (r(2) = 0.78) represents a further confirmation of the terrestrial origin of DOC in the plume region. Vertical profiles of DOC F(n(280)) and F(n(355)) and those of the specific fluorescence, F(s(280)), and F(s(355)), in stations located off the shelf, showed differences between northern and southern stations, suggesting a different composition of DOC in the two regions. Finally, although these data refer to a single Survey, they represent the first simultaneous DOC and CDOM view on the influence of the Arno River to the carbon cycle in an estuarine Mediterranean region.

J	Mannino, A; Harvey, HR				Mannino, A; Harvey, HR			Black carbon in estuarine and coastal ocean dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured black carbon (BC) in ultrafiltered, high-molecular weight dissolved organic matter (UDOM) in surface waters of Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean (U.S.A.) to investigate the importance of riverine and estuarine dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a source of BC to the ocean. BC was 5-72% of UDOM-C (27 +/- 17%), which corresponds to 8.9 +/- 6.5% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with higher values in the heavily urbanized midbay region of the Delaware Estuary and lower yields in the river and coastal ocean. The spatial and seasonal distributions of BC along the salinity gradient of Delaware Bay suggest that the elevated levels of BC in surface water UDOM originate from localized sources, possibly from atmospheric deposition or release from resuspended sediments. BC in UDOM made up 4-7% of the DOC in the coastal Atlantic Ocean, revealing that river-estuary systems are important exporters of colloidal BC to the ocean. The annual flux of BC from Delaware Bay UDOM to the Atlantic Ocean was estimated at 2.4 X 10(10) g BC yr(-1), supporting the hypothesis that the DOC pool is an important contributor of BC to the ocean.

J	Yamamoto, H; Liljestrand, HM; Shimizu, Y				Yamamoto, H; Liljestrand, HM; Shimizu, Y			Effects of dissolved organic matter surrogates on the partitioning of 17 beta-estradiol and p-nonylphenol between synthetic membrane vesicles and water	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Partition coefficients of two estrogenic compounds, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and p-nonylphenol (NP), between synthetic membrane vesicles (K'(lipw) values) and water were determined using equilibrium dialysis to evaluate the potential biological uptake of these compounds with and without the presence of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) surrogates, Suwannee River fulvic acid, dialyzed Aldrich humic acid,and polyphenolic tannic acid. Overall, K'(lipw) values for E2 and NP reduced by 20-30% with the increase of DOM concentration from 0 to approximately 4 mg of C/L, a typical DOM concentration in the aquatic environment. This trend for E2 and NP is similar to that obtained by other researchers for moderately hydrophobic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with three or four rings. A three-phase compartment model with three independent interactions, the sorption of E2 or NP by DOM surrogate (K-oc), the sorption of DOM surrogates by membrane vesicles (K-lipDOM), and the partition of E2 or NP by membrane vesicles (K-lipw), was proposed, and K'(lipw) values for E2 or NP in the presence of DOM were calculated. The model predicted the decrease in K'(lipw) values with the increase of DOM concentration, and the predictions using the three linear interactions agreed satisfactorily with the experimental results at relatively lower concentration of DOM.

When subsurface aeration is applied to an anaerobic groundwater system with pH > 7, Fe(II) is oxidised heterogeneously. The heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II) can result in the in situ formation of Fe colloids. To study this, the effect of substances commonly found in groundwater (e.g. PO4, Mn, silicate and fulvic acid) on the heterogeneous oxidation process was measured. The heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II) becomes retarded when PO4, Mn, silicate or fulvic acid is present in the groundwater in addition to Fe(II). Phosphate and fulvic acid retarded the oxidation process most. The heterogeneous oxidation was described using a model with a homogeneous (k(1)) and an autocatalytic oxidation rate constant (k'(2)). From the modelling it followed that the homogeneous oxidation rate constant was not affected or even slightly elevated whereas the autocatalytic oxidation rate constant decreased remarkably by the addition of PO4, Mn, silicate or fulvic acid. From speciation calculations it followed that the decreased availability of the Fe(H) species can only explain a small part of the retarded autocatalytic oxidation process. Therefore exploratory calculations were performed to gain insight into whether the adsorption of PO4 or fulvic acid could explain the retarded autocatalytic oxidation. These calculations showed that the adsorption of fulvic acid could explain the retarded autocatalytic oxidation process. In contrast the adsorption of PO4 only partly explained the retarded autocatalytic oxidation process. In terms of colloid formation this study shows that the heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II) in presence of PO4, Mn, silicate or fulvic acid leads to the formation of Fe colloids. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ravichandran, M				Ravichandran, M			Interactions between mercury and dissolved organic matter - a review	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) interacts very strongly with mercury, affecting its speciation, solubility, mobility, and toxicity in the aquatic environment. Strong binding of mercury by DOM is attributed to coordination of mercury at reduced sulfur sites within the organic matter, which are present at concentrations much higher than mercury concentrations found in most natural waters. The ability of organic matter to enhance the dissolution and inhibit the precipitation of mercuric sulfide, a highly insoluble solid, suggests that DOM competes with sulfide for mercury binding. This is confirmed by very high conditional stability constants for mercury-organic sulfur (RSHg) complexes (10(25)-10(32)) recently reported in literature. DOM appears to play a key role in the photochemical reduction of ionic mercury to elemental mercury and subsequent reoxidation of elemental mercury to ionic mercury, thus affecting volatilization loss and bioavailability of mercury to organisms. DOM affects the production and bioaccumulation of methylmercury, the most bioaccumulative mercury species in fish. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cleveland, CC; Neff, JC; Townsend, AR; Hood, E				Cleveland, CC; Neff, JC; Townsend, AR; Hood, E			Composition, dynamics, and fate of leached dissolved organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems: Results from a decomposition experiment	ECOSYSTEMS												Fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are an important vector for the movement of carbon (C) and nutrients both within and between ecosystems. However, although DOM fluxes from throughfall and through litterfall can be large, little is known about the fate of DOM leached from plant canopies, or from the litter layer into the soil horizon. in this study, our objectives were to determine the importance of plant-litter leachate as a vehicle for DOM movement, and to track DOM decomposition [including dissolve organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) fractions], as well as DOM chemical and isotopic dynamics, during a long-term laboratory incubation experiment using fresh leaves and litter from several ecosystem types. The water-extractable fraction of organic C was high for all five plant species, as was the biodegradable fraction; in most cases, more than 70% of the initial DOM was decomposed in the first 10 days of the experiment. The chemical composition of the DOM changed as decomposition proceeded, with humic (hydrophobic) fractions becoming relatively more abundant than nonhumic (hydrophilic) fractions over time. However, in spite of proportional changes in humic and nonhumic fractions over time, our data suggest that both fractions are readily decomposed in the absence of physicochemical reactions with soil surfaces. Our data also showed no changes in the delta(13)C signature of DOM during decomposition, suggesting that isotopic fractionation during DOM uptake is not a significant process. These results suggest that soil microorganisms preferentially decompose more labile organic molecules in the DOM pool, which also tend to be isotopically heavier than more recalcitrant DOM fractions. We believe that the interaction between DOM decomposition dynamics and soil sorption processes contribute to the 813 C enrichment of soil organic matter commonly observed with depth in soil profiles.

J	Kaiser, E; Sulzberger, B				Kaiser, E; Sulzberger, B			Phototransformation of riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the presence of abundant iron: Effect on DOM bioavailability	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We conducted studies with high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW), hydrophobic, and hydrophilic dissolved organic matter (DOM) from an oligotrophic alpine river, the Tagliamento River (Italy), to assess the effect of light on DOM utilization by riverine bacterioplankton. Immediately after the exposure of the DOM fractions to simulated or natural sunlight, short-term (1 h) bacterial utilization of all DOM fractions decreased by up to 80%, compared with the uptake of the corresponding nonirradiated fractions. The addition of scavengers suggests that reactive oxygen species caused this bacterial growth inhibition. After the long-term growth of bacteria on irradiated DOM, uptake was unchanged for HMW DOM, considerably lower for LMW and hydrophilic DOM, and much higher for hydrophobic DOM, compared with the nonirradiated fractions. These results suggest that the phototransformation of HMW, LMW, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic DOM results in contrasting effects on their bioavailability. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that bacteria preferably used the larger molecular sizes of all nonirradiated fractions. Light induced no significant shifts in the apparent molecular weight distribution of the four DOM fractions. However, the highly bioavailable LMW DOM (especially the portion similar to5 kDa) was no longer taken up after irradiation. We conclude that light overall leads to a strong decrease in microbial DOM transformation during hydrological transport in the Tagliamento River.																	0024-3590					MAR	2004	49	2					540	554								WOS:000224979500022		
J	Gong, GC				Gong, GC			Absorption coefficients of colored dissolved organic matter in the surface waters of the East China Sea	TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES												Seasonal and spatial variations in the sea surface absorption coefficients of colored dissolved organic matter in the entire shelf of the East China Sea were studied extensively. The absorption coefficients generally showed a decreasing trend from the inner shelf near the China coast toward the offshore direction in all four seasons. The results indicate that more than 75% of the shelf waters belong to the Case 2 water category. It was ascertained that the entire absorption spectra in the UV ( lambda = 250 nm) to the Visible (lambda = 500 nm) range could not be well-described when only one single exponential decay function was employed. Four discontinuity points at wavelengths of around 250, 275, 325 and 400 nm in the log-transformed absorption spectra were noted. Based on the regressive analysis of a total of 137 absorption spectra, the mean slopes of the exponential decay constant at 250, 275, 325 and 400 nm were 0.018 +/- 0.004, 0.025 +/- 0.004, 0.015 +/- 0.002 and 0.012 +/- 0.002 nm(-1), respectively. In addition, it was found that the values of the absorption coefficients had a high linear correlation with salinity. This suggests that in terms of mixing, the concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter were mostly conservative. The finding of such a relationship provides researchers with the opportunity to obtain remotely obtain the absorption coefficients of colored dissolved organic matter by using the newly-developed Scanning Low-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SLFMR) technique.

J	Jansen, B; Nierop, KGJ; Vrugt, JA; Verstraten, JM				Jansen, B; Nierop, KGJ; Vrugt, JA; Verstraten, JM			(Un)certainty of overall binding constants of Al with dissolved organic matter determined by the Scatchard approach	WATER RESEARCH												One of the best approaches to date to obtain overall binding constants (K-o) for Al and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from acidic soil solutions is to collect 'free' Al data with diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and to infer the K-o values by fitting a continuous distribution model based on Scatchard plots. Although there is clear established literature demonstrating the usefulness of the Scatchard approach, relatively little attention has been given to a realistic assessment of the uncertainties associated with the final fitted K-o values. In this study we present an uncertainty analysis of the fitted K-o values using a synthetic dataset with different levels of random noise and a real data set using DGT data from an acidic soil solution. The parameters in the continuous distribution model and their corresponding upper and lower 95% uncertainty bounds were determined using the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM) algorithm. Although reasonable fits of the distribution model to the experimental data were obtained in all cases, an appreciable uncertainty in the resulting K-o values was found due to three main reasons. Firstly, obtaining 'free' Al data even with the DGT method is relatively difficult, leading to uncertainty in the data. Secondly, before Scatchard plots can be constructed, the maximum binding capacity (MBC) must be estimated. Any uncertainty in this MBC propagates into uncertainty associated with the final plots. Thirdly, as the final fitted K-o values are largely based on extrapolation, a small uncertainty in the fit of the binding data results in an appreciable uncertainty in the obtained K-o. Therefore, while trends in K-o for Al and DOM could easily be discerned and compared, the uncertainty in the K-o values hinders the application in quantitative speciation calculation. More comprehensive speciation models that avoid the use of K-o seem to fit better for this purpose. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Whitehead, RF; de Mora, SJ				Whitehead, RF; de Mora, SJ			Modeling the effect of ozone loss on photobleaching of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the St. Lawrence estuary	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Temporal trends in total ozone for the St. Lawrence estuary were estimated from ground-based measurements at the NOAA/CMDL station in Caribou, Maine. Linear regression analysis showed that from 1979 to 1999 total ozone has decreased by about 3.3% per decade on an annual basis and less than or equal to6.2% per decade on a monthly basis relative to unperturbed (pre-CFC) levels. The influence of increased ultraviolet-B (280-320 nm) radiation associated with ozone depletion on water column photochemical processes was evaluated by modeling the photobleaching of chromophoric dissolved organic material (CDOM). Linear regression analysis showed small (<0.5% per decade), but statistically significant upward trends in maximum noontime photobleaching rates. Most notably, positive trends in relative rates for May, June, and July, when maximum absolute rates are expected, were predicted. A global model based on TOMS ozone data revealed increases in photobleaching of <= 3% per decade at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Radiation amplification factors for increases in photochemically weighted UV (280-400 nm) in response to ozone depletion were estimated at 0.1 and 0.08 for photobleaching of CDOM absorbance at 300 and 350 nm, respectively. Application of the laboratory-based model to conditions that more closely resembled those in situ were variable with both overestimation and underestimation of measured rates. The differences between modeled rates and observed rates under quasi-natural conditions were as large or larger than the predicted increases due to ozone depletion. These comparisons suggest that biological activity and mixing play an important, but as yet ill-defined, role in modifying photochemical processes.																	0886-6236					FEB 17	2004	18	1							GB1025	10.1029/2003GB002101						WOS:000189373300001		
J	Muller, MB; Fritz, W; Lankes, U; Frimmel, FH				Muller, MB; Fritz, W; Lankes, U; Frimmel, FH			Ultrafiltration of nonionic surfactants and dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A brownwater sample with a high content of humic substances (HS) was fractionated by multistage ultrafiltration (mst-UF) into five fractions with nominal molecular weights ranging from > 30 to > 1 kDa. Fractions were characterized with respect to molecular size distribution and structure. Size exclusion chromatography with online DOC detection revealed that mst-UF yielded fractions with decreasing M-p (molecular weight at peak maximum) and polydispersities from nominally large to small mst-UF fractions. C-13 MAS NMR analysis showed that the content of carbohydrate structures decreased from the original sample toward smaller molecular weight (MW) fractions, which in turn contained more carboxylic groups and branched aliphatic structures. Specific UV absorbances (SUVA(254)) were highest in the > 30 kDa fraction and decreased with decreasing MW. To evaluate whether separation mechanisms other than size exclusion were of importance during the fractionation, the behavior of low molecular weight model compounds (MC) with a range of polarities was studied. Recoveries decreased with increasing hydrophobicity of the MC. For selected nonylphenol ethoxylates and 4-nonylphenol the recovery correlated well with the hydrophile-lipophile balance value. The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) caused an additional loss of hydrophobic MC, possibly because of sorption of the compounds onto DOM fouling layers. The hydrophilic MC caffeine was recovered almost completely (85-86%) regardless of the DOM content of the model solution. It was concluded that size exclusion was the dominant fractionation mechanism for caffeine, whereas hydrophobic interactions played a major role during the mst-UF fractionation of nonpolar contaminants. For a better understanding of the behavior of polyfunctional molecules such as HS, the effect of other physicochemical properties needs to be investigated in further studies.																	0013-936X					FEB 15	2004	38	4					1124	1132		10.1021/es0300416						WOS:000188996600028	14998027

Seawater was collected in the central part of the Gulf of Riga and at the entrance of the Gulf in June 1999. DOM was extracted from Parnu River water by use of tangential ultrafiltration. Experimental series were enriched with DOM, DOM in combination with nitrate and phosphate, and only with inorganic nutrients. Enrichments were added in ranges of their natural concentrations. Dinophysis acuminata, Protoperidinium brevipes and Gymnodinium spp. were dominant species in the initial dinoflagellate community. During the experiment, the best growth of dinoflagellates was observed in treatments with DOM and DOM in combination with phosphate, mainly due to active growth of D. acuminata (maximum mu = 0.8 day(-1)). Significant uptake of dissolved organic nitrogenous compounds was seen, indicating the importance of heterotrophic nutrition among the phytoplankton species.																	0018-8158					FEB 15	2004	514	1-3					127	137		10.1023/B:hydr.0000018213.38191.f9						WOS:000220784400013

The distribution of DOM-fractions (based on hydrophobic-hydrophilic and acidic-basic breaks) showed that two of the fractions, hydrophilic acids (HiA) and bases (HiB), were more abundant in all growth phases of M. aeruginosa than the other three fractions, hydrophobic acids (HoA), hydrophobic neutrals (HoN), and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). The proportion of HiB increased, while the HiA fraction decreased with aging of the algae. After UV treatment, all algal DOM became recalcitrant to bacterial degradation without complete photo-degradation. This was more pronounced in DOM from older cultures (stationary phase) as compared to DOM from the exponential growth phase. The DOM distribution was also significantly different after UV exposure, implying photoalteration to the chemical composition of algal DOM. The proportions of the HiB fraction decreased as a percent of the total dissolved organic carbon pool by 1.5-8.1 % after UVA treatment and by 5.3-15.8 % after UVB treatment. In contrast, the HiA fraction increased by similar amounts. Analyses of fluorescent properties and some carboxylic acids confirmed the changes to the HiB and HiA fractions. However, the increased HiA fraction may not be linked to the recalcitrance of algal DOM after UV exposure, since there was no difference in the biodegradability of this fraction before and after UV treatments. The initially labile HiB fraction, however, became less available to bacteria after UV exposure depending on intensity and thus may be linked to the recalcitrance of algal DOM after UV exposure. Our results confirm earlier reports that algal DOM can be changed in its chemical composition as well as biodegradability by UV radiation, and suggest that the HiB fraction may be important in the formation of recalcitrant algal DOM.																	0003-9136					FEB	2004	159	2					271	286		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159/0271						WOS:000220663400007

To examine the differences in quantity, temporal dynamics, and quality of DOM between Cerrado and Pine plantations we collected rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, litter leachate (under pine only) and soil solution at 15, 80, and 200 cm depth in weekly intervals during the rainy seasons 1997/98 and 1998/99. We determined total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and assessed DOM quality by separating hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions and by NMR analysis of organic layer extracts. The rainfall had a mean DOC concentration of 2.6 mg L-1. The mean concentrations of DOC in the throughfall of the pine plantations (5.0-10.5 mg L-1) were significantly above those of Cerrado (2.6-4.9 mg L-1). During the first part of the rainy seasons (October-December), the concentrations of DOC in the soil solution (15-200 cm depth) under Cerrado and pine did not differ significantly. During the second part of both rainy seasons (January-April), the concentrations of DOC in the soil solution under Cerrado (4.4-5.1 mg L-1) exceeded those under PI (1.4-2.7 mg L-1). Possible explanations of the latter include higher DOM input into the Cerrado soil and a stronger retention and/or faster mineralisation of the pine DOM than of the Cerrado DOM in the mineral soil. As the structural composition of DOM extracted from the organic layer under Cerrado and pine did not differ significantly, faster mineralisation was the most likely explanation for partly lower DOC concentrations in the soil solution under pine than under Cerrado. This assumption was supported by increasing contributions of hydrophobic DOM to total DOM with increasing depth under pine while, under Cerrado, the DOM composition did not change with depth. The reason for DOM mineralisation under pine was probably the higher N availability because total N concentrations were 11-23 times higher under pine than under Cerrado.

In addition, the effect of added nitrogen on soil water DOM concentration and composition was tested. Forested plots covering a gradient of precipitation, climate, slope, and aspect in Olympic National Park were fertilized with the addition of 20, 10 and zero ( control) kg urea-N ha(-1) y(-1). Seven sites had the two different fertilizer treatments and control plots, while the additional four sites had no fertilizer treatments. Soil water DOC concentrations ranged from 0.5 mg C/L to 54.1 mg C/L, with an average value of 14.1 mg C/L. Streams had low DOC concentrations ranging from 0.2 mg C/L to 4.4 mg C/L, with an average value of 1.2 mg C/L. DOM composition was examined with regard to molar ratios, H: C, O: C and N: C, index of unsaturation, average carbon oxidation state, and specific absorbance. Fertilizer had no consistent effect on either DOM concentration or composition across the study sites. Soil depth influenced both DOM concentration and composition. Shallow soil water DOM had greater concentrations, higher specific absorbance, a higher degree of unsaturation, and had lower molar ratios compared to deep soil water samples. Overall, changes in DOM stoichiometry and specific absorbance as a function of soil depth were consistent despite the diversity of the forested study sites sampled.

Here, we tested the inter-instrument variability of three WetLabs, Inc. SAFIres using quinine sulfate standards. As with any fluorometer, intensity and spectral biases in fluorescence output due to properties of the SAFIre's optical components necessitate corrections. Low response of the instrument to quinine sulfate and lack of an excitation/emission channel at the fluorescence maximum of this standard precluded direct spectral calibration. Calibrations conducted using seawater as a secondary standard provided an acceptable alternative. The field performance of the SAFIre from two experiments is presented here. Time series Contour plots show that the instrument has the ability to detect small differences in COM optical properties, and observed fluorescence emission ratios Lire indicative of changes in sources of the material over the course of the study. The SAFIre was found to extend multispectral measurements to include high spatial and high temporal resolution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kilduff, JE; Mattaraj, S; Wigton, A; Kitis, M; Karanfil, T				Kilduff, JE; Mattaraj, S; Wigton, A; Kitis, M; Karanfil, T			Effects of reverse osmosis isolation on reactivity of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter in physicochemical processes	WATER RESEARCH												A field reverse osmosis system was used to isolate dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two lacustrine and two riverine surface water sources. The rejection of DOM was on the order of 99% and did not vary significantly with pressure. A simple mass balance model using a single measured value of rejection predicted the concentration within the closed-loop isolation system. The effect of operating pressure and solution flux on mass recovery of DOM was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. Under controlled laboratory conditions, >99% of a lacustrine DOM could be accounted for. A fraction of the isolated DOM was not recoverable using hydrodynamic cleaning; however, this fraction was recovered by using a pH 10 NaOH wash solution. The mass recovered in the NaOH solution increased from <1% to >6% with increasing transmembrane pressures from 414 kPa (60 psi) to 1000 kPa (145 psi), respectively. This is consistent with fouling that results from an increase in solution flux, and a decrease in tangential crossflow velocity. Under field conditions, mass balances were generally >95% and mass recovery was >90% in all cases. The effects of temperature on solution flux were consistent with changes in fluid viscosity; effects of temperature on membrane diffusivity or morphological properties were small. RO isolation under low pressure conditions designed to maximize DOM recovery had little effect on DOM reactivity evaluated in terms of nanofiltration membrane fouling, XAD-8 resin adsorption, activated carbon adsorption, competition with trichloroethylene for adsorption sites on activated carbon, and molecular weight distribution measured using size exclusion chromatography.

J	Aoki, S; Fuse, Y; Yamada, E				Aoki, S; Fuse, Y; Yamada, E			Determinations of humic substances and other dissolved organic matter and their effects on the increase of COD in Lake Biwa	ANALYTICAL SCIENCES												Humic substances and other dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Lake Biwa and the surrounding rivers were investigated to elucidate their origins and behavior. An annual increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) has been observed in the northern basin of Lake Biwa since 1985. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the northern and southern basins of Lake Biwa were 1.7 - 2.4 mgCl and 1.9 - 2.6 mgC/l, respectively. The DOC concentrations tended to be high in summer and low in winter, and the seasonal changes in the concentrations of humic substances were small. The humic substances content of DOM was considered to be comparatively small because the ratio of the concentration of humic substances to DOC was in the range of 0.14 - 0.32. From the results of the fractionation of DOM in lake waters, it was estimated that hydrophobic acids, such as humic substances and hydrophilic acids, were about 25% and 45%, respectively. The main origin of hydrophobic acids in Lake Biwa may be humic substances from soils around the rivers that flow into Lake Biwa, while hydrophilic acids may be due to the inner production by phytoplankton. Therefore, the increase of COD in the northern basin of Lake Biwa may be attributed to the contributions of not only humic substances but also hydrophilic acids.																	0910-6340					JAN	2004	20	1					159	164		10.2116/analsci.20.159						WOS:000188289700029	14753276	
J	Meier, M; Chin, YP; Maurice, P				Meier, M; Chin, YP; Maurice, P			Variations in the composition and adsorption behavior of dissolved organic matter at a small, forested watershed	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												This study investigated the properties and sorption by goethite of bulk (unfractionated) dissolved organic matter (DOM) from surface and shallow groundwaters at McDonalds Branch, a small freshwater fen in the New Jersey Pine Barrens (USA). Water samples were collected in the spring and fall seasons from two surface-water sampling sites, an upstream potential recharge area and a downstream discharge area, as well as from a set of in-stream nested wells in the upstream potential recharge area. Changes in DOM concentration, molecular weight distribution, and molar absorptivity at 280 nm were measured. Surface and shallow (1.6 m below land surface) groundwater samples collected in spring 1997 in the potential recharge zone (actual recharge impeded by an extensive clay lens) were found to be very similar in terms of DOM concentrations and physicochemical properties and is believe to originate from a common source. Samples taken in fall 1997 yielded no surface water because of drought conditions, and the shallow groundwater DOM collected from the recharge well contained significantly less and chemically altered DOM. This change in chemical properties is believed to be caused in part by fractionation resulting from sorption to mineral phases. Batch isotherm experiments show that sorption by goethite of the DOM from both spring surface and shallow groundwaters in the potential recharge area were similar, whereas the fall groundwater possessed a much lower affinity for the sorbent. This study demonstrated that shallow groundwaters collected under different climatic and hydrologic conditions (spring, high flow versus fall, drought conditions) resulted in different physicochemical properties and adsorption affinities.																	0168-2563					JAN	2004	67	1					39	56		10.1023/B:BIOG.0000015278.23470.f7						WOS:000188852600003		
J	Bertilsson, S; Carlsson, P; Graneli, W				Bertilsson, S; Carlsson, P; Graneli, W			Influence of solar radiation on the availability of dissolved organic matter to bacteria in the Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The influence of solar radiation on the ability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to support bacterial growth, was studied in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the SWEDARP 1997/1998 cruise with SA Agulhas December 1997-February 1998. Vertical profiles of water samples (2-3000m) were obtained from the Spring Ice Edge (SIE, 60degreesS, high chlorophyll-a) and from the Winter Ice Edge (WIE, 56degreesS, low chlorophyll-a) areas. Filter-sterilized water from each area and depth was incubated under natural solar radiation and in the dark for comparison. Photobleaching of humic substance fluorescence occurred in all studied water samples. The bleaching was typically larger in the initially more fluorescent deep waters, compared to the low-fluorescent surface waters. Both the irradiated water and the dark controls were re-inoculated with a mixed bacterial inoculum from the initially sampled water. Bacterial growth (accumulating cells) and bacterial production (protein synthesis) were monitored during a 16-19 day incubation of these cultures at near in situ temperature (2 degreesC). Bacterial growth in cultures prepared from SIE water was largest at the surface (2-25 m), while the growth in corresponding cultures from the WIE did not vary much over depth. In contrast to the observed photobleaching, no clear effects of the irradiation on the ability of the DOM to support bacterial growth could be observed in either of the experiments. Hence, the degradation of fluorescent structures and other photochemical alterations of the organic matter did not have a major effect on the total pool of biodegradable organic substrates. The lack of effects of photoreactions on bacterial growth potential in the present study disagrees with the short-term bacterial growth response observed in other oceanic environments. This could be due to the different experimental approaches employed (short-vs. long-term incubations) or may indicate that the impact of photoreactions on bacterial growth in the Southern Ocean differ substantially from aquatic systems that are more influenced by terrestrial environments, as well as the warmer oligotrophic oceanic environments.

Facilitated Heterogeneous Photodegradation of Dissolved Organic Matter by Particulate Iron	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												The photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from the leaves of River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) was examined, with a particular focus on the photochemical generation of CO(2), consumption of O(2), and the effect of particulate iron minerals on these photochemical reactions. Solutions of leaf leachate were irradiated with ultraviolet and visible light in the presence and absence of amorphous iron oxides. Addition of fresh iron oxide was found. to increase the rate of photodegradation of the organic matter by up to an order of magnitude compared to the reactions without added iron oxide. The ratio of CO(2) produced to O(2) consumed was similar to 1: 1 in both the presence and absence of iron oxyhydroxide. The reactivity of the iron oxides was dependent on the preparation method and decreased with increased storage time. These results suggest that photochemical reactions on particle surfaces should be considered when examining carbon transformation in aquatic ecosystems, especially at sites with potential for the: production of iron oxyhydroxides.

Leaching of DOM through It the soil column was found to be almost un-retarded. Decidedly similar behaviour was exhibited by Ni suggesting that it migrated as organic complexes. Whilst Cu was also found to be leached, significant retardation was evident. However, the importance of DOM in promoting the mobility of both Cu and Ni was evidenced by their lack of mobility when added to the soil column as inorganic forms. The presence of DOM did not prevent Zn from becoming completely adsorbed by the soil solid phase. In relation to WHO drinking water guidelines, only Ni concentrations showed potential environmental significance. due to the relatively poor retention of Ni by the sludge solid phase.

J	Huang, QG; Weber, WJ				Huang, QG; Weber, WJ			Interactions of soil-derived dissolved organic matter with phenol in peroxidase-catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The influence of dissolved soil organic matter (DSOM) derived from three geosorbents of different chemical composition and diagenetic history on the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions of phenol was investigated. Phenol conversion and precipitate-product formation were measured, respectively, by HPLC and radiolabeled species analysis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis (CE) were used to characterize the products of enzymatic coupling, and the acute toxicities of the soluble products were determined by Microtox assay. Phenol conversion and precipitate formation were both significantly influenced by cross-coupling of phenol with dissolved organic matter, particularly in the cases of the more reactive and soluble DSOMs derived from two diagenetically "young" humic-type geosorbents. FTIR and CE characterizations indicate that enzymatic cross-coupling in these two cases leads to incorporation of phenol in DSOM macromolecules, yielding nontoxic soluble products. Conversely, cross-coupling appears to proceed in parallel with self-coupling in the presence of the relatively inert and more hydrophobic DSOM derived from a diagenetically "old" kerogen-type shale material. The products formed in this system have lower solubility and precipitate more readily, although their soluble forms tend to be more toxic than those formed by dominant cross-coupling reactions in the humic-type DSOM solutions. Several of the findings reported may be critically important with respect to feasibility evaluations and the engineering design of associated remediation schemes.																	0013-936X					JAN 1	2004	38	1					338	344		10.1021/es0304289						WOS:000187781800060	14740756	
J	Smith, REH; Allen, CD; Charlton, MN				Smith, REH; Allen, CD; Charlton, MN			Dissolved organic matter and ultraviolet radiation penetration in the Laurentian Great Lakes and tributary waters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Stations in Lakes Huron, Erie, Ontario, and some associated bays and tributaries were surveyed to better characterize the penetration of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and its controlling factors. Photic (1%) depths of the more damaging short and medium wavelength UVR (305-340 nm) varied widely, from 6-12 m in Lake Huron to less than 0.25 m in tributaries. Water renewal times were inversely related to vertical attenuation coefficients (K-d) and also to total and carbon-specific absorption coefficients (a(CDOM), a(CDOM)) for dissolved organic matter (DOM), which varied much more than did the bulk concentration of DOM. K-d was well correlated with a(CDOM) but not DOM concentration in lakes. Particulate absorption coefficients were appreciable in magnitude, averaging up to 103% of a(CDOM) at 380 nm and reflecting significant influence of both algal and detrital particles. Modeling of K-d between 305 and 380 nm indicated that absorption by DOM and water accounted for 88-94% of UVR attenuation in tributaries, but only 37-77% in lakes. Scattering and absorption by particles accounted for up to 41 and 52% respectively of attenuation at the longer UVR wavelengths. Longer water renewal times in these large lake systems are associated with changes in optical properties of DOM that favor increased UVR penetration, and particles assume an increasingly important role as the chromophoric intensity of the DOM decreases.																	0380-1330						2004	30	3					367	380								WOS:000224463400003

In a laboratory study, using both OM taken directly from a humic lake and chemically isolated fulvic acid, we monitored the mineralization of dissolved OM in freshwater under purely oxic and anoxic conditions, under oxic then anoxic conditions, and under anoxic then oxic conditions, for 426 d. Between 5% and 24% of the initial OM was mineralized, with most extensive mineralization occurring under purely oxic and anoxic-oxic conditions. A sequential change in the O-2 regime did not result in greater overall degradation, but initially anoxic conditions favored subsequent oxic mineralization. A substantially greater fraction of the OM was degraded than in previous shorter studies, with as much as 50% of the total OM degradation occurring after 147 d into the experiment. Three fractions of the degradable OM were identified: OM degraded only under oxic conditions (68-78%), OM degraded more rapidly under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions (16-18%), and OM degraded at equal rates under both oxic and anoxic conditions (6-14%). The degradation patterns of natural dissolved OM from a humic lake and chemically isolated fulvic acid were very similar, which indicates a similar level of bioavailability. The difference between anoxic and oxic degradation was greater in our long-term studies than in previous short-term experiments, which indicates that the oxic and anoxic degradation potentials vary with increasing overall OM recalcitrance and that similar oxic and anoxic degradation rates can be expected in short-term experiments in which <30% of the long-term degradable OM is allowed to decompose.

In this study, we measured bulk stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios, lipid composition, and compound-specific carbon isotopic ratios of HMW-DOM samples collected from four U.S. estuaries (Boston Harbor/Massachusetts Bay, Delaware/Chesapeake Bay, San Diego Bay, and San Francisco Bay). Analytical results show (1) a fraction of HMW-DOM (lipid associated) in estuarine and coastal waters is derived from bacteria and phytoplankton; (2) this fraction of HMW-DOM is formed by various release processes of bacterial membrane components and bacterial reworking of phytoplankton-derived material; (3) this fraction of HMW-DOM is generally present in all samples from different coastal systems despite variable organic matter inputs and environmental conditions, suggesting an important bacterial role in HMW-DOM formation.																	0024-3590					JAN	2004	49	1					297	302								WOS:000188381100031

Concentrations of DOC in the surface water ranged from 318 to 2043 muM and decreased from the upper estuary to the coastal areas, and were not only influenced by source strength but also by the hydrology and geomorphology of the mangrove-dominated southwest Florida estuarine area of Everglades National Park. Mangroves provided a significant input of DOM to the estuarine region. This terrestrially derived DOM underwent conservative mixing in these estuaries, but at salinities greater than or equal to30 a clear switch from terrestrial to marine DOM was observed indicating a change in the nature and origin of the dominant DOM. The results show that the dynamics of DOM in these subtropical estuaries are complex and that geomorphologically compartmentalized estuarine subregions can be distinguished based on the optical characteristics of their DOM.

Here we present evidence that seagrass detritus from the widespread species Thalassia testudinum is an important source of ocean color and a UV-protective substance in a low latitude coastal shelf region of the United States. The production and light-induced degradation of chromophoric (sunlight-absorbing) dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from T testudinum was examined under field and controlled laboratory conditions to obtain data that could be used to estimate the contribution of seagrass-derived CDOM to the coastal pool. The laboratory studies measured the temperature dependence and photodegradation of the spectral (UV-visible, fluorescence) and molecular mass properties of CDOM produced during the degradation of T testudinum detritus, The rate of CDOM production is temperature-dependent with rates doubling when temperature increases from 21.4 to 32.6degreesC. The magnitude of this increase is close to the widely observed Q(10) factor for microbial decomposition, indicating that the CDOM production was likely microbially mediated. The absorption coefficients and fluorescence of CDOM from T testudinum decreased on exposure to solar UV radiation (UVR) and the wavelength dependence was determined for this photobleaching process.

Recent evidence pointed towards a microbial source of CDOM in the aquatic environment and led to the proposal that phytoplankton is not a direct source of CDOM, but that heterotrophic bacteria, through reprocessing of DOM of algal origin, are an important source of CDOM. In a recent experiment designed at looking at the effects of elevated pCO(2) on blooms of the coccolithophorid alga Emiliania huxleyi, we found that despite the 3 different pCO(2) levels tested (190, 414 and 714 ppm), no differences were observed in accumulation of CDOM over the 20 d of incubation. Unlike previous mesocosm experiments where. relationships between CDOM accumulation and bacterial abundance have been observed, none was observed here. These results provide some new insights into the apparent lack of effect of pCO(2) on CDOM accumulation in surface waters, and question the previously proposed mechanisms and rates of CDOM production in natural phytoplankton blooms.

The factors controlling distribution of CDOM far from the direct influence of land are not well known, as CDOM abundance and distribution does not directly correlate with phytoplankton productivity or biomass, or with dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration. As part of a larger study of the dynamics of CDOM in the open ocean, we investigated direct release from plankton as a factor contributing to distribution patterns of CDOM. We measured the production of CDOM by zooplankton (copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, salps, polychaetes), protozoans (colonial radiolaria), and by the colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Groups of individual species of plankton were incubated and absorption spectra were obtained for their release products. CDOM was produced by all organisms examined, and absorption spectra varied by taxa, with major taxa exhibiting characteristic absorption peaks. Plankton-produced DOM is a source of labile carbon and thus facilitates microbial activity, and CDOM may also serve as photoprotection for near-surface-living organisms. Zooplankton likely play an important role in the CDOM cycle in the Sargasso Sea, directly through release/excretion of CDOM and indirectly by providing a labile substrate (excretia) for microbial-mediated production of CDOM.

Therefore, ten soil and phyllosilicate clay fractions were used (after carbon oxidation) to investigate relationships between DOC retention at pH 7 and content of dithionite-extractable iron (Fed), specific surface area (SSA) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). DOC sorption sites were identified by blocking reactive hydroxyl groups with phosphate on subsamples. Reversibility of DOC sorption was determined by desorption experiments. Soil clay fractions sorbed about twice as much DOC as phyllosilicates. A positive relationship between DOC sorption and Fed content suggests that this is due to pedogenic oxides in soil clays. Positive trends were also observed with SSA or CEC. Sorption of 9-44 mug DOC m(-2) indicates that DOC interacts only with fractions of the mineral surfaces. Phosphate treatment of subsamples reduced DOC sorption by 39-64% indicating a contribution of reactive hydroxyl groups as well as of siloxane surfaces of phyllosilicate clay minerals to DOC sorption. Desorption experiment removed 13-50% of sorbed DOC. Samples with and without phosphate treatment desorbed similar absolute amounts of DOC indicating that DOC associations with siloxane surfaces may be weaker than interactions with hydroxyl groups.

J	Yamashita, Y; Tanoue, E				Yamashita, Y; Tanoue, E			Chemical characteristics of amino acid-containing dissolved organic matter in seawater	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Total hydrolyzable amino acid and fluorescence properties, using 3-dimensional excitation and emission matrix (3DEEM) spectroscopy of the bulk and four molecular mass fractions (GF/F-0.1 mum, 0.1 mum-10 kDa, 10 kDa-5 kDa and < 5 kDa) of dissolved organic matter (DOM), were determined in the surface (10 m) and deep (1000 m) waters of Sagami Bay, Japan. Among the molecular mass fractions, we found a successive decrease in degradation index (DI) derived from amino acid composition with decreasing molecular mass in both surface and deep waters, indicating that relatively fresh and large molecules become smaller in size along a degradation pathway. In the 3DEEM fluorescence patterns of high molecular mass DOM, only a tryptophan-like fluorophore was observed in the surface water. In contrast, both tryptophan- and tyrosine-like fluorophores were observed in the deep water, indicating that amino acid-containing DOM in the high molecular mass fractions was comprised of protein molecules or least degraded proteins (polypeptides) in surface water, but in deep water other forms of amino acids were dominant even though the molecular mass fractions were of the same size. We hypothesize that degradation products (peptides) form high molecular mass fraction in deep water DOM. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because climatic conditions of the Southwestern USA are different than temperate environments, DOM from three freshwater reservoirs (Saguaro Lake, Bartlett Lake and Lake Pleasant) was investigated to determine the importance of allochthonous and autochthonous organic material. Results from the study show hydrophobic acids constitute a small percentage of the DOM, while the neutral and hydrophilic fractions are more prevalent. C/N ratios are comparatively low relative to other freshwater systems, ranging between 28 and 35 for the hydrophobic acid fractions, while DOC/DON ratios are seasonally influenced by epilimnionic algal growth. The isolated organic fractions were low in aromatic content measured by solid-state C-13 NMR resulting in low aromatic to aliphatic carbon ratios. Organic material recovered from Saguaro Lake and Lake Pleasant display traits that suggest most allochthonous contributions are highly attenuated favoring organic material from autochthonous sources (low C/N and aromatic/aliphatic carbon ratios), whereas organic material from Bartlett Lake demonstrated a greater seasonal perturbation in source influence.

Exposure of DOM to ultrasound resulted in decreases in TOC, Color(465), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), aromaticity and molecular weight, while DOM acidity increased. Compared to 20 kHz ultrasound, greater sonochemical transformation of DOM occurred at 354 kHz and at higher energy density, due to greater (OH)-O-. radical production. The changes to DOM properties suggest that ultrasound may significantly affect DOM-pollutant interactions (e.g. facilitate desorption of hydrophobic organics from DOM or promote complexation between metallic cations and DOM).																	0922-6168						2004	30	7-8					735	753		10.1163/1568567041856954						WOS:000225067200006

Four surface waters, two secondary municipal sewage effluents (SMSEfs) and Suwannee river natural organic matter were used as DOM. The ozone decompositions in the DOM solutions were separated by instantaneous ozone consumption and slower ozone decay. The effect of H2O2 addition on the ozone decay was clearly observed at slower ozone decay. Ozone decomposition rate at slower ozone decay increased linearly with H2O2 dose. DBP-d(4) was exponentially decreased with ozone consumption. Ozone consumption required to decompose 90% of DBP-d(4) ((DeltaO(3))(90%)) in SMSEFs was higher than those in surface waters. The (DeltaO(3))(90%) per DOC of DOM values were from 22 to 23 mumole/mgC for SMSEFs and from 10 to 17 mumole/mgC for surface waters. The (DeltaO(3))(90%) values were correlated to specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) for surface waters.																	0273-1223						2004	49	4					57	62								WOS:000220706800011	15077948

However, interpreting the >10,000 wave length-dependent fluorescence intensity data points represented in EEMs has posed a significant challenge. Fluorescence regional integration, a quantitative technique that integrates the volume beneath an EEM, was developed to analyze EEMs. EEMs were delineated into five excitation-emission regions based on fluorescence of model compounds, DOM fractions, and marine waters or freshwaters. Volumetric integration under the EEM within each region, normalized to the projected excitation-emission area within that region and dissolved organic carbon concentration, resulted in a normalized region-specific EEM volume (Phi(i,n)). Solid-state carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, and EEMs were obtained for standard Suwannee River fulvic acid and 15 hydrophobic or hydrophilic acid, neutral, and base DOM fractions plus nonfractionated DOM from wastewater effluents and rivers in the southwestern United States. DOM fractions fluoresced in one or more EEM regions. The highest cumulative EEM volume (Phi(T,n) = SigmaPhi(i,n)) was observed for hydrophobic neutral DOM fractions, followed by lower Phi(T,n) values for hydrophobic acid, base, and hydrophilic acid DOM fractions, respectively. An extracted wastewater biomass DOM sample contained aromatic protein- and humic-like material and was characteristic of bacterial-soluble microbial products. Aromatic carbon and the presence of specific aromatic compounds (as indicated by solid-state C-13 NMR and FTIR data) resulted in EEMs that aided in differentiating wastewater effluent DOM from drinking water DOM.																	0013-936X					DEC 15	2003	37	24					5701	5710		10.1021/es034354c						WOS:000187248000031	14717183

Photochemically produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role in many photochemical reactions, but the role of ROS for the photochemical facilitation of bacterial utilization of DOM is previously not known. We exposed lake water with high DOM concentrations to simulated sunlight, with and without the addition of ROS scavengers, and quantified the effect on the production of CO2, the loss of DOM absorbance, and bacterial growth. The photodegradation of DOM through microbial-photochemical interactions was dependent on the action of ROS. The use of ROS scavengers in irradiations of the lake water revealed that photobleaching below 300 nm and the production Of CO2 are highly dependent on the action of ROS. Photobleaching and CO2 production in irradiated waters decreased significantly with the addition of ROS scavengers, but post-irradiation bacterial growth in the samples containing an ROS scavenger increased significantly above those without. The decrease in ROS activity (CO2 production) likely caused an accumulation of bioavailable DOM and enhanced microbial processes. Rapid degradation of DOM through the action of ROS would be especially important in high DOM systems. The high photochemical ROS activity may counterbalance the positive effects on bacterial activity of DOM photolysis into bioavailable molecules.

J	White, EM; Vaughan, PP; Zepp, RG				White, EM; Vaughan, PP; Zepp, RG			Role of the photo-Fenton reaction in the production of hydroxyl radicals and photobleaching of colored dissolved organic matter in a coastal river of the southeastern United States	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Photochemical reactions involving colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in natural waters are important determinants of nutrient cycling, trace gas production and control of light penetration into the water column. In this study the role of the hydroxyl radical ((.)OH) in CDOM photodegradation was explored as well as the contribution of photo-Fenton chemistry to (.)OH formation. Photochemically produced (.)OH was observed under aerobic and dioxygen-depleted conditions in highly colored, acidic natural water samples obtained from a freshwater reach of the Satilla River, a river in the southeastern United States. Net aerobic (.)OH formation along with the production of hydrogen peroxide and Fe(II) provided evidence of photo-Fenton produced (.)OH. A reduction in (.)OH production in the presence of iron chelators further suggests the importance of iron and the photo-Fenton reaction in this water. Apparent quantum yield values for the photochemical production of (.)OH were determined from 300-320 nm. In addition, the relationship between (.)OH photoproduction and effects of irradiation on the optical properties of CDOM was examined. Changes in the light absorption and fluorescence properties of water samples from the Satilla River and other natural waters were compared to (.)OH production rates. The ability of constituents of Satilla River water, principally the dissolved organic matter, to scavenge (.)OH was also considered. Results indicate that the photo-Fenton reaction accounts for more than 70% of total photochemical (.)OH production in Satilla River water. Given the significant levels of (.)OH produced in this water, it is possible that (.)OH influences CDOM photobleaching.																	1015-1621					DEC	2003	65	4					402	414		10.1007/s00027-003-0675-4						WOS:000187287200009

The effects of irradiation time, initial pH values, and dissolved iron and copper on photobleaching were investigated. The DOC concentration and the UV/VIS absorption decreased with increasing amounts of absorbed light energy. The wavelengths of the maximum bleaching effect and of the maximum amount of absorbed energy were found to coincide. A decrease in the average hydrodynamic radii of the DOM was shown by size-exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, evidence was given that hydrophilic moieties of the DOM were preferentially photodegraded while hydrophobic ones remained relatively unaffected or were even formed. Iron was an important factor of DOM photobleaching in the bog lake. However, copper, another redox active metal ion, inhibited the bleaching processes.																	1015-1621					DEC	2003	65	4					415	424		10.1007/s00027-003-0670-9						WOS:000187287200010

Three different methods for measuring binding capacity were used and evaluated, head-space solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME), enhanced solubility (ES) and fluorescence quenching (FQ). It was concluded that for samples with complex matrixes it was possible to measure the net effect of the DOM binding capacity and the salting out effect of the matrix. It was further concluded that DOM facilitated transport should be taken into account for non-ionic PAHs with lg K OW above 5, at DOM concentrations above 250 mg C/L. The total DOM concentration was found to be more important for the potential of facilitated transport than differences in the DOM binding capacity.

To specifically elucidate the role of mineral surfaces and pedogenic oxides for DOC retention at pH 7, we sorbed DOC to bulk soil (illitic surface soils of a toposequence) and corresponding clay fraction (< 2 mum) samples after the removal of organic matter and after removal of organic matter and pedogenic oxides. The DOC retention was related to the content of dithionite-extractable iron, specific surface area (SSA, BET-N-2 method) and cation exchange capacity (pH 7). The reversibility of DOC sorption was determined by a desorption experiment. All samples sorbed 20-40% of the DOC added. The DOC sorption of the clay fractions explained the total sorption of the bulk soils. None of the mineral phase properties investigated was able to solely explain the DOC retention. A sorption of 9 to 24 mug DOC m(-2) indicated that DOC interacted only with a fraction of the mineral surface, since loadings above 500 mug m(-2) would be expected for a carbon monolayer. Under the experimental conditions used, the surface of the silicate clay minerals seemed to be more important for the DOC sorption than the surface of the iron oxides. The desorption experiment removed 11 to 31 % of the DOC sorbed. Most of the DOC was strongly sorbed.

These processes were investigated in different Danish freshwaters. Aggregation of DOC in short-term (hours) mixing events at increasing salinity was low. In one stream with forest and wetland runoff and in a humic lake, the decrease of DOC over a 0 to 25 ppt salinity gradient was 2 to 5%. Optical analyses by absorption and fluorescence, revealed changes in the composition of the humic components due to salt. The bioavailability of terrestrial DOC was also investigated and found not to change moving from limnic to estuarine conditions. Although the yield of freshwater bacteria cells was about twice the yield of estuarine bacteria, the utilization of DOC was identical and not influenced by the bacterial communities. In addition, optical analyses showed that although utilization of DOC was equal, freshwater and estuarine bacterial communities differed in their preference to the humic fractions.

J	Wang, JM; Huang, CP; Allen, HE				Wang, JM; Huang, CP; Allen, HE			Modeling heavy metal uptake by sludge particulates in the presence of dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												The uptake of the seven heavy metal ions Cd(II), Co(H), Cr(III), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(11), and Zn(II) by sludge particulates in single-metal systems was investigated. Results showed that under acidic and neutral pH conditions, the uptake of all heavy metals by sludge particulates increases with the increase of pH. However, in the alkaline pH region, the uptake of Cu(II), Ni(II), and Co(II) decreases with the increase of pH, primarily due to the high dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration in high pH conditions. Based on chemical reactions among heavy metal, sludge solids, and DOM, a mathematical model describing metal uptake as functions of DOM and pH was developed. The stability constants of metal-sludge and metal-DOM complexes can be determined using this model in conjunction with experimental metal uptake data. Results showed that, for the secondary sludge sample collected from Baltimore Back River Wastewater Treatment plant on March 1997, the stability constants of Cu(II)-sludge complex (log K-S) and Cu(II)-DOM complex (log K-L) are 5.3+/-0.2 and 4.7+/-0.3, respectively; for Ni(II), they are 4.0+/-0.2 and 3.9+/-0.2, respectively. Results also showed that under neutral and low pH conditions (pH < 8), the DOM effects on metal uptake for all heavy metals are insignificant. Therefore, the DOM term in the model can be ignored. Results showed that, for the secondary sludge sample collected from Baltimore Back River Wastewater Treatment plant on December 1996, the estimated log K-S values of metal sludge complexes for Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Cu(H), Ni(II), Pb(H), and Zn(II) are, respectively, 3.6 +/- 0.2, 3.0 +/- 0.1, 5.5 +/- 0.1, 4.8 +/- 0.1, 3.1 +/- 0.1, 5.1 +/- 0.1, and 4.4 +/- 0.3.

The products were characterised using UV/vis spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and by the analysis of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOA). The degradation experiments were performed with water from a brown water lake or its isolated fulvic acid fraction and sodium hydroxide at different reaction times and temperatures. Depending on the wavelength and the reaction time, the UV/vis absorbance between 230 nm and 600 nm increased or decreased. The behaviour of model compounds during reactions in alkaline media was compared to the UV/vis spectroscopic behaviour of DOM. The release of LMWOA was described by kinetic data and compared to the data of model reactions. Evidence was given for the carboxylic esters playing a significant role in the release of LMWOA only during the beginning of the alkaline degradation. The results gained by SEC with on-line UV and DOC detection showed that the average size of DOM was decreasing, and that a major part of the degradation products consisted of low-molecular-weight mono- and dicarboxylic acids.																	0323-4320					NOV	2003	31	3					213	224		10.1002/aheh.200300491						WOS:000187023100003

However, current water quality regulations do not consider the protective effects of water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. To determine the effect of DOC concentration and source on silver toxicity, nine different natural organic matter isolates were used in 96-h static-renewal toxicity tests with fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The 96-h dissolved silver median lethal concentrations (LC50) among different sources of dissolved organic matter varied by up to fivefold (4.5-23.3 mug/L). Further, toxicity tests with organic matter from the site with the lowest 96-h LC50 value suggested only limited additional attenuation of silver toxicity when DOC concentration was increased from 5.1 to 14.0 mg/L. With this site excluded, we found little more than a twofold difference among 96-h dissolved Ag LC50s for the remaining sources (10.1-23.3 mug/L). However, significant toxicological differences among sites remained. It was apparent that organic matter from different sources varied both chemically and toxicologically, but no conclusions could be drawn that related compositional variation to observed Ag toxicity for these isolates.

J	Fiedler, S; Kalbitz, K				Fiedler, S; Kalbitz, K			Concentrations and properties of dissolved organic matter in forest soils as affected by the redox regime	SOIL SCIENCE												Changes in concentrations and properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) caused by oxygen deficiency are poorly understood. We estimated the influence of redox conditions on DOM dynamics in the field, sampling soil solutions at different depths of three soils (Humic and Histic Gleysol, Chromic Cambisol) along a soil catena in the cool-humid Black Forest (Germany) over a period of 2 years. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and determined the specific absorbance at 280 nm and two humification indices derived from fluorescence spectra to describe the aromaticity and complexity of DOM. Redox potential (Eh) was monitored continuously in situ. In the forest floor, DOC concentrations ranged independent of soil organic matter content and redox regime between 40 and 60 mg C L-1. DOC concentrations in all soils decreased with depth, accompanied by a decrease in DOM aromaticity and complexity. In the mineral subsoil, DOC concentrations, aromaticity, and DOM complexity were smallest in the aerobic soil (Chromic Cambisol; Eli > 500 mV) and largest in the most anaerobic soil (Histic Gleysol; Eli < 100 mV). Large DOM retention in the aerobic soil could be related to high contents of Fe oxides, highlighting their importance for DOM adsorption. Despite significantly reduced DOM retention under anaerobic conditions, it remains relatively large because the main DOM adsorbents changed from Fe oxides under oxic conditions to clay minerals, which were about 100 times more abundant under anaerobic conditions than Fe oxides. We found indications that biodegradation of DOM contributes more to DOM retention under anaerobic conditions, and we conclude that large DOM fluxes from anaerobic forest soils are the result of limited DOM adsorption in the subsoil rather than large DOM release from the topsoil.

Perylene was used as the probe molecule to avoid problems encountered with other fluorescent probes. Results from a wide range of wetland samples suggest that static quenching dominates, that other quenchers do not interfere with analyses, and that full quenching on sorption does not occur for all samples. The latter result indicates that the quantum yield of the sorbed probe must be accounted for in quantifying the magnitude of K-moc values by FQ. Observed K-moc values compared favorably with those measured by the solubility enhancement method. Overall our results suggest that FG can be used as a quick and reliable screening tool as long as precautions are taken to ensure the validity of the results.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 15	2003	37	20					4717	4723		10.1021/es026388a						WOS:000186133000027	14594383

DOM sampled from a number of surface waters (a eutrophic wetland, a blackwater stream, and river water from a mix-use watershed) was used in this study. Moreover, a fulvic acid from Lake Fryxell, Antarctica, was also used to represent a DOM derived from a strictly autochthonous source. Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) at pH 5.5 was observed for all target DOMs used in this study, but rates varied widely. In general, photoreduction rates increased with increasing iron concentrations, but the type of DOM appeared to influence the kinetics to a larger degree. The rate of reduction was significantly greater for DOM derived from terrestrial systems than from predominantly autochthonous materials even if additional iron was added to the later. A positive correlation was observed between rates of Cr(VI) photoreduction and properties of the isolated DOM samples whereby faster reduction was observed for larger more aromatic substrates. On the basis of the fast rates reported for the dark reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by Fe(II)organic ligands, we hypothesize that the rate-limiting step in these reactions is the photoreduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer pathway after absorption of light by Fe(III)-DOM complexes or by reduction of Fe(III) by superoxide or other intermediates formed after light absorption by DOM. Thus, the rate of Cr(VI) photoreduction to Cr(III) in natural sunlit waters is dependent upon both the amount of iron present and the nature of the dissolved organic matter substrate.																	0013-936X					OCT 1	2003	37	19					4403	4409		10.1021/es034261v						WOS:000185696500034	14572092	
J	Kim, SB; Corapcioglu, MY; Kim, DJ				Kim, SB; Corapcioglu, MY; Kim, DJ			Effect of dissolved organic matter and bacteria on contaminant transport in riverbank filtration	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												A mathematical model for the transport of hydrophobic organic contaminants in an aquifer under simplistic riverbank filtration conditions is developed. The model considers a situation where contaminants are present together with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacteria. The aquifer is conceptualized as a four-phase system: two mobile colloidal phases, an aqueous phase, and a stationary solid phase. An equilibrium approach is used to describe the interactions of contaminants with DOM, bacteria, and solid matrix. The model is composed of bacterial transport equation and contaminant transport equation. Numerical simulations are performed to examine the contaminant transport behavior in the presence of DOM and bacteria. The simulation results illustrate that contaminant transport is enhanced markedly in the presence of DOM and bacteria, and the impact of DOM on contaminant mobility is greater than that of bacteria under examined conditions. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the model is sensitive to changes of three lumped parameters: K-1(+) (total affinity of stationary solid phase to contaminants), K-2(+) (total affinity of DOM to contaminants), and K-3(+) (total affinity of bacteria to contaminants). In a situation where contaminants exist simultaneously with DOM and bacteria, contaminant transport is mainly affected by a ratio of K-1(+)/K-2(+)/K-3(+), which can vary with changes of equilibrium distribution coefficient of contaminants and/or colloidal concentrations. In riverbank filtration, the influence of DOM and bacteria on the transport behavior of contaminants should be accounted to accurately predict the contaminant mobility. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Imai, A; Matsushige, K; Nagai, T				Imai, A; Matsushige, K; Nagai, T			Trihalomethane formation potential of dissolved organic matter in a shallow eutrophic lake	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water samples from the shallow eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, was fractionated and characterized by using resin adsorbents into 5 classes: aquatic humic substances (AHS), hydrophobic neutrals, hydrophilic acids (HiA), bases (BaS) and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). Subsequently, the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), ultraviolet absorbance to dissolved organic carbon (UV:DOC) ratio, and molecular size distribution of the DOM, AHS and hydrophilic fractions (HiF) (HiF = HiA + BaS + HiN) were examined. The THMFP of HiF, normalized on a DOC basis; was found to be comparable to that of AHS (0.176 mumol THM mg C-1 vs. 0.195 mumol THM mg C-1, respectively). The importance of HiF over AHS as a THM precursor became more pronounced when THMFP was evaluated in terms of concentration. In this case, the THMFP of HiF was much greater than that of AHS (0.374 mumol THM 1(-1) vs. 0.229 mumol THM 1(-1), respectively). Molecular size distributions all exhibited a narrow size range and relatively low molecular weights. The weight-averaged molecular weights of DOM, AHS and HiF were 780, 957 and 606 g mol(-1), respectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Johannessen, SC; Miller, WL; Cullen, JJ				Johannessen, SC; Miller, WL; Cullen, JJ			Calculation of UV attenuation and colored dissolved organic matter absorption spectra from measurements of ocean color	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The absorption of ultraviolet and visible radiation by colored or chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) drives much of marine photochemistry. It also affects the penetration of ultraviolet radiation (UV) into the water column and can confound remote estimates of chlorophyll concentration. Measurements of ocean color from satellites can be used to predict UV attenuation and CDOM absorption spectra from relationships between visible reflectance, UV attenuation, and absorption by CDOM. Samples were taken from the Bering Sea and from the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and water types ranged from turbid, inshore waters to the Gulf Stream. We determined the following relationships between in situ visible radiance reflectance, L-u/E-d (lambda) (sr(-1)), and diffuse attenuation of UV, K-d(lambda) (m(-1)): K-d(323nm) = 0.781[L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.07); K-d(338nm) = 0.604[L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.12); K-d(380 nm) = 0.302[L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.24). Consistent with published observations, these empirical relationships predict that the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM absorption increases as diffuse attenuation of UV decreases. Excluding samples from turbid bays, the ratio of the CDOM absorption coefficient to K-d is 0.90 at 323 nm, 0.86 at 338 nm, and 0.97 at 380 nm. We applied these relationships to SeaWiFS images of normalized water-leaving radiance to calculate the CDOM absorption and UV attenuation in the Mid-Atlantic Bight in May, July, and August 1998. The images showed a decrease in UV attenuation from May to August of approximately 50%. We also produced images of the areal distribution of the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM absorption in the Georgia Bight. The spectral slope coefficient increased offshore and changed with season.

By means of size-exclusion chromatography it was shown that the more hydrophilic moieties of the DOM were preferentially photodegraded while the more hydrophobic ones remained relatively unaffected or were even formed. The combined photochemical-biological degradation proved to be more important than the pure photochemical mineralization. Formic, acetic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, and succinic acids were identified as important degradation products. Their contribution to the dissolved organic carbon increased from 0.31% before to 6.4% after 24 h irradiation. About 33% of the bioavailable photoproducts of DOM were comprised of these LMWOAs. The influence of nitrate on the formation of carboxylic acids could not be observed in the investigated system. Kinetic experiments indicated that degradation of LMWOAs occurred simultaneously during irradiation experiments, alpha-oxygen-substituted LMWOAs being more amenable to these processes. Dissolved iron acted as a catalyst of DOM photodegradation and LMWOA photoformation. Copper played an antagonistic role in the irradiation experiments, reducing the formation of formic, acetic, and malonic acids while increasing the formation of oxalic acid.																	0013-936X					SEP 15	2003	37	18					4190	4198		10.1021/es0263339						WOS:000185326700023	14524452	
J	Hernes, PJ; Benner, R				Hernes, PJ; Benner, R			Photochemical and microbial degradation of dissolved lignin phenols: Implications for the fate of terrigenous dissolved organic matter in marine environments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Molecular level characterizations of dissolved lignin were conducted in Mississippi River plume waters to study the impact of various removal mechanisms (photooxidation, microbial degradation, and flocculation) on dissolved organic material (DOM) concentrations and compositions. Prior to analysis, dissolved (<0.2-&mu;m pore size) samples were size fractionated by ultrafiltration into high molecular weight (HMW; >1 kDalton) and low molecular weight (LMW; <1 kDalton) components. At salinities <25 psu, flocculation and microbial degradation were the primary factors affecting lignin concentrations. At salinities >25 psu, photooxidation was a dominant factor influencing lignin compositions and concentrations. Diagnostic indicators of photooxidation include a sharp decrease in the percentage of lignin in the HMW size fraction, changes in ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols, and increases in LMW acid: aldehyde ratios for both vanillyl and syringyl phenols. A 10-day incubation experiment with plume water indicated rates of microbial degradation of dissolved lignin that were similar to30% of photooxidation rates in surface waters. These results highlight the importance of microbial as well as photochemical processes in the cycling of terrigenous DOM in coastal waters. Neither flocculation nor microbial degradation significantly altered lignin composition, suggesting that composition is primarily determined by source and photochemical transformation. Overall, high removal rates indicate the potential importance of terrigenous DOM as a carbon and nutrient source in the coastal ocean. Strong correlations between absorption coefficients at 350 nm and dissolved lignin demonstrate the potential for using absorption to trace terrigenous DOM in coastal environments with significant riverine input.

J	Han, NZ; Thompson, ML				Han, NZ; Thompson, ML			Impact of dissolved organic matter on copper mobility in aquifer material	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM) and biosolids-derived DOM have been implicated in the mobility of metals in soils and aquifer materials. To investigate the effect of DOM on copper mobility in aquifer material, DOM derived from sewage biosolids was separated into two apparent molecular-weight (MW) fractions, 500 to 3500 Da (LMW) and >14 000 Da (HMW). In each MW fraction, the DOM was further fractionated into hydrophilic, hydrophobic acid, and hydrophobic neutral compounds by an XAD-8 chromatography technique. The mobility of these DOM components and their influences on copper transport in a sesquioxide-coated, sandy aquifer material were examined with column transport experiments. The LMW DOM was found to be highly mobile, whereas the HMW DOM had a greater tendency to be retained by the aquifer material. Within the same MW fraction, the mobility of DOM followed the order of hydrophilic DOM > hydrophobic acid DOM > hydrophobic neutral DOM. Copper breakthrough curves in the presence of various DOM components showed that, except for the HMW hydrophilic fraction, DOM components enhanced Cu transport through the aquifer columns at early stages of transport (the first 75 pore volumes). In the later stages, however, all the DOM components substantially inhibited Cu mobility. We hypothesize that several mechanisms could account for retardation of Cu movement in the presence of the DOM fractions, including the formation of ternary complexes between the aquifer material, Cu, and DOM; changes in the electrostatic potential at the solid-phase surface; and pH buffering by DOM.																	0047-2425					SEP-OCT	2003	32	5					1829	1836								WOS:000185409500029	14535326	
J	Scully, NM; Tranvik, LJ; Cooper, WJ				Scully, NM; Tranvik, LJ; Cooper, WJ			Photochemical effects on the interaction of enzymes and dissolved organic matter in natural waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Extracellular enzymes such as phosphatase (Pase) and glucosidase (Gase) can be inactivated in natural waters through photochemical processes. In this study, we examined the mechanisms involved in enzyme inactivation. We first explored the possibility of direct photoinactivation. The quantum yield spectrum (Phi(lambda)) for the direct photoinactivation of Pase increased exponentially with decreasing wavelength, with a much steeper slope relative to other Phi(lambda). This, combined with modeled half-life values for direct photoinactivation in excess of 5 d, indicates that direct photoinactivation of Pase by natural sunlight in lakes is negligible. Nonetheless, photoinactivation of enzymes occurred rapidly in light-exposed natural waters and suggested an indirect mechanism. The pH of natural waters greatly affected photoinactivation. In acid humic lake water exposed to ultraviolet radiation, the half-lives of both Pase and Gase were 4 h. The half-life of these enzymes under the same conditions were twofold higher for lake waters obtained from a limed humic lake (8 h). The higher rate of inactivation in acid water was likely caused by a pH-mediated increase in Fe photoreduction and enzyme binding. Solutions of Pase with Fe(II) and H(2)O(2) resulted in rapid inactivation (half-life 7 min at 8.9 mumol L(-1) Fe). There was no significant inactivation of controls without H(2)O(2), indicating that enzymes are inactivated through Fe(III)/enzyme binding, which is enabled through the oxidation of Fe(II) by H(2)O(2) to Fe(III). Direct inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was ruled out by tests with ROS scavengers.

Community respiration (oxygen uptake), microbial density (colony-forming units on agar plates), leaf decomposition, and community metabolic profiles (metabolism patterns in sole carbon source utilization assays) were measured. Stream benthic microbial communities responded immediately and positively to increases in terrestrially derived DOM. Respiration activity and density estimates increased significantly, but there was no significant change in community metabolic profile. Responses were greater to DOM extracted from upper soil horizons than from deeper soils. Community respiration and bacterial abundance also increased in response to an aquatic DOM source, but were accompanied by a significant change in community metabolic profiles. Results provide direct experimental evidence that benthic microbial communities of forest headwater streams are able to rapidly utilize terrestrial DOM.																	0045-5067					AUG	2003	33	8					1444	1451		10.1139/X03-030						WOS:000184755600010

The technique is a wet chemical analogue to electrochemical approaches now in use for ligand studies of many other trace transition metals in natural waters. Ligand characteristics are obtained from additions of ionic Hg to buffered lake, river water, and seawater and determination of the wet chemically reducible fraction following equilibration of the spike. This approach is robust, as demonstrated by (i) analysis using three reducing agents of varying strengths, (ii) replicate analyses, (iii) comparison to well-characterized complexing species (chloride and EDTA) using a competitive ion-exchange resin, and (iv) kinetic studies. Results indicate that Hg-complexing equivalents are present in the dissolved phase (<0.2 mum) ranging from <1 to >60 nN concentrations and with log conditional stability constants (log K') in the range of 21-24. Only one ligand class was found in the natural waters analyzed. There was indirect evidence for a class of organic ligands that formed reducible complexes with Hg in freshwater. Such ligand characteristics indicate that the vast majority of ionic inorganic Hg dissolved in freshwater and coastal saltwaters is associated with organic complexes. Concentrations, affinities, and kinetics implicate multidentate chelation sites as the principal complexing moieties for Hg and discourage the use of humic carboxylic acids as a proxy for the ligands/functional groups.

J	Stedmon, CA; Markager, S				Stedmon, CA; Markager, S			Behaviour of the optical properties of coloured dissolved organic matter under conservative mixing	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The optical properties of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can be used, in some environments, to trace water masses and provide information about the dynamics of the dissolved organic fraction in natural waters. This work presents the results from a modelling exercise, laboratory experiment and field data, which describe the variations in the optical properties of CDOM during mixing. The exponential slope coefficient (S) is frequently used to characterise different CDOM pools; however, its behaviour during conservative mixing of two different CDOM types is often misunderstood. Identification of a theoretical conservative mixing line allows the rapid identification of non-conservative processes (e.g. in situ production, flocculation and degradation) acting on the pool during mixing. The results suggest that some of the patterns reported in the literature could purely be a result of conservative mixing rather than a product of non-conservative processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The strategy of nutrient additions was to introduce a pulse of new nutrients in concentrations that mimic natural inputs and to survey community structure and organic matter fluxes long enough so that plankton became nutrient-limited. Maximal bacterial biomass attained roughly double the initial value, while autotrophic carbon increased by nearly an order of magnitude. The microflagellate-dominated community released more DOC per unit biomass (5.5 +/- 7.2 to 50.6 +/- 28.0 mug C mug Chl a(-1) day(-1) versus 3.4 +/- 3.4 to 10.8 +/- 4.6 mug C mug Chl a(-1) day(-1) for diatom-dominated phytoplankton), POC increase was modest (similar to300 mug C l(-1)) and there was little change in DOC. Organic carbon partitioning during two experiments in which diatoms prevailed was dominated by POC (>800 mug C l(-1)) in the exponential growth phase with an increasing contribution of particulate carbohydrates that paralleled gradual nutrient depletion. Transition to the stationary phase and the decay of autotrophic communities were accompanied by the net accumulation of a carbohydrate-rich DOC.																	0142-7873					AUG	2003	25	8					949	966		10.1093/plankt/25.8.949						WOS:000184532300007		
J	Stedmon, CA; Markager, S; Bro, R				Stedmon, CA; Markager, S; Bro, R			Tracing dissolved organic matter in aquatic environments using a new approach to fluorescence spectroscopy	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex and poorly understood mixture of organic polymers that plays an influential role in aquatic ecosystems. In this study we have successfully characterised the fluorescent fraction of DOM in the catchment of a Danish estuary using fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). PARAFAC aids the characterisation of fluorescent DOM by decomposing the fluorescence matrices into different independent fluorescent components. The results reveal that at least five different fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant amounts) in the catchment and that the relative composition is dependent on the source (e.g. agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic production). Four different allochthonous fluorescent groups and one autochthonous fluorescent group were identified. The ability to trace the different fractions of the DOM pool using this relatively cheap and fast technique represents a significant advance within the fields of aquatic ecology and chemistry, and will prove to be useful for catchment management.

In turn, biodegradation changes the properties of the remaining DOM, which may be decisive for the formation of stable organic carbon in soil. To gain information on both mechanisms and controlling factors of DOM biodegradation and the properties of biodegraded DOM, we investigated changes in the composition of 13 different DOM samples extracted from maize straw, forest floors, peats, and agricultural soils during a 90-day incubation using UV absorbance, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, FTIR- spectroscopy, H-1-NMR spectroscopy, pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and C-13 natural abundance before and after incubation. Changes in the DOM properties were related to the extent of biodegradation determined by the release of CO2, Increasing UV absorption and humification indices deduced from fluorescence emission spectra. and increasing portions of aromatic H indicated relative enrichment of aromatic compounds during biodegradation. This enrichment significantly correlated with the amount of DOC mineralized suggesting that aromatic compounds were relatively stable and slowly mineralized. C-13 depletion during the incubation of highly degradable DOM solutions indicated an enrichment of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Py-FI mass spectra indicated increasing contents of phenols and lignin monomers at the expense of lignin dimers and alkylaromatics during incubation. This partial degradation of higher-molecular, lignin-derived DOM compounds was accompanied by relative increases in the proportions of lower-molecular degradation products and microbial metabolites. Carbohydrates, especially when abundant at high initial contents, seem to be the preferred substrate for microorganisms. However, four independent methods suggested also some microbial production of carbohydrates and peptides during DOM degradation. After incubation, the composition of highly degradable DOM samples became similar to relatively stable DOM samples with respect to aromaticity, carbohydrate content, and thermal stability. We conclude that DOM biodegradation seems to result in organic matter properties being a precondition for the formation of stable carbon. These structural changes induced by DOM biodegradation should also result in stronger DOM sorption to the soil matrix additionally affecting DOM stabilization. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The procedure was then applied to fractionate water samples obtained at various sampling locations throughout two surface water treatment plants (WTPs) in central New Jersey to study its effectiveness, DOM occurrence, and variation along treatment units. The treatment plants utilize different treatment methods, hence producing variability in DOM fractions suitable for examining the procedure's effectiveness. This procedure was compared with current fractionation protocols and proved to be accurate in fractionation of low DOM water. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

For comparison, we also collected data in the open ocean waters of North Atlantic. The exponential slope of the CDOM absorption spectrum varied within a narrow range around 0.0176 nm(-1) (SD=0.0020 nm(-1)). When data from all the regions were considered altogether, the relationship between phytoplankton absorption and chlorophyll concentration was generally similar to the one previously established for open oceanic waters. Our coastal data, however, show that significant departures from the general trend may occur due to peculiar pigment composition and cell size. In some coastal areas, high phaeopigment concentrations gave rise to especially high blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton absorption. The NAP absorption covaried with the particle dry weight. Most absorption spectra of these particles were well described by an exponential function with a slope averaging 0.0123 nm(-1) (SD=0.0013 nm(-1)). In some highly turbid waters, the spectra exhibited a signature possibly associated with iron oxides. In the Baltic Sea, NAP absorption systematically showed lower values at wavelengths shorter than 440 nm than predicted from the fitted exponential function. Overall, the variability in the absorption properties of European coastal waters showed some consistent patterns despite the high diversity of the examined waters. Distinct features were identified in the phytoplankton and NAP components. An absorption budget is presented and parameterizations are proposed.

DOM was isolated from water sampled from an oligotrophic river, the River Tagliamento (Italy). The recovery of total DOM was up to 42% with both isolation techniques. In addition to 1- and 2-D solution-state NMR, we also applied 1-D solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy for DOM characterization. C-13 NMR spectroscopy only produced broad overlapping resonances, thus allowing a bulk characterization of DOM composition. However, it demonstrated that the bulk chemical composition of the two DOM fractions exhibited minor spatial-temporal changes. The 2-D experiments (TOCSY, HMQC) showed that the solid phase extracted hydrophobic DOM contained predominantly aliphatic esters, ethers, and hydroxyl groups, whereas the ultrafiltered DOM was comprised partially of peptides/protein, with further evidence for a small amount of aliphatic/fatty acid material. Sugars were present in both DOM fractions. The results show the two isolation techniques selected for different suites of compounds within the bulk DOM pool.																	0013-936X					JUL 1	2003	37	13					2929	2935		10.1021/es020174b						WOS:000183973700033	12875396	
J	Tang, JW; Johannesson, KH				Tang, JW; Johannesson, KH			Speciation of rare earth elements in natural terrestrial waters: Assessing the role of dissolved organic matter from the modeling approach	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Humic Ion-Binding Model V, which focuses on metal complexation with humic and fulvic acids, was modified to assess the role of dissolved natural organic matter in the speciation of rare earth elements (REEs) in natural terrestrial waters. Intrinsic equilibrium constants for cation-proton exchange with humic substances (i.e., pK(MHA) for type A sites, consisting mainly of carboxylic acids), required by the model for each REE, were initially estimated using linear free-energy relationships between the first hydrolysis constants and stability constants for REE metal complexation with lactic and acetic acid. pK(MHA) values were further refined by comparison of calculated Model V "fits" to published data sets describing complexation of Eu, Tb, and Dy with humic substances. A subroutine that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of REE complexation with inorganic ligands (e.g., Cl-, F-, OH-, SO42-, CO32-, PO43-), incorporating recently determined stability constants for REE complexes with these ligands, was also linked to Model V. Humic Ion-Binding Model V's ability to predict REE speciation with natural organic matter in natural waters was evaluated by comparing model results to "speciation" data determined previously with ultrafiltration techniques (i.e., organic acid-rich waters of the Nsimi-Zoetele catchment, Cameroon; dilute, circumneutral-pH waters of the Tamagawa River, Japan, and the Kalix River, northern Sweden). The model predictions compare well with the ultrafiltration studies, especially for the heavy REEs in circumneutral-pH river waters. Subsequent application of the model to world average river water predicts that organic matter complexes are the dominant form of dissolved REEs in bulk river waters draining the continents. Holding major solute, minor solute, and REE concentrations of world average river water constant while varying pH, the model suggests that organic matter complexes would dominate La, Eu, and Lu speciation within the pH ranges of 5.4 to 7.9, 4.8 to 7.3, and 4.9 to 6.9, respectively. For acidic waters, the model predicts that the free metal ion (Ln(3+)) and sulfate complexes (LnSO(4)(+)) dominate, whereas in alkaline waters, carbonate complexes (LnCO(3)(+) + Ln[CO3](2)(-)) are predicted to out-compete humic substances for dissolved REEs. Application of the modified Model V to a "model" groundwater suggests that natural organic matter complexes of REEs are insignificant. However, groundwaters with higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations than the "model" groundwater (i.e., >0.7 mg/L) would exhibit greater fractions of each REE complexed with organic matter. Sensitively analysis indicates that increasing ionic strength can weaken humate-REE interactions, and increasing the concentration of competitive cations such as Fe(III) and Al can lead to a decrease in the amount of REEs bound to dissolved organic matter.

In the site where silver fir recruitment was abundant, humification processes prevailed, and the soil DOM had a high content in aliphatic and phenolic acids. This enhanced the hormone-like activity in the soil, which could in turn promote growth of silver fir seedlings. In the site with poor fir recruitment, the soil DOM underwent rapid mineralization and was richer in inorganic nutrients, but had lower concentrations of aliphatic and phenolic acids, and lower hormone-like activity.																	0098-0331					JUL	2003	29	7					1549	1564		10.1023/A:1024214528514						WOS:000183630000003	12921435

Experiments ranged from small-scale core perfusions with defined compounds (glucose, bovine serum albumin) to mesocosms receiving natural leaf leachate or water from different streams. Response variables included bacterial production, oxygen consumption, extracellular enzyme activity, and community similarity as manifest by changes in banding patterns of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). All DOM manipulations generated responses in at least one metabolic variable. Additions of both labile and recalcitrant materials increased either oxygen consumption, production, or both depending on background DOM. Enzyme activities were affected by both types of carbon addition with largest effects from the labile mixture. Cluster analysis of RAPD data showed strong divergence of communities exposed to labile versus recalcitrant DOM. Additions of leaf leachate to mesocosms representing hyporheic flowpaths caused increases in oxygen consumption and some enzyme activities with weaker effects on production. Community structure was strongly affected; samples from the leachate-amended mesocosms clustered separately from the control samples. In mesocosms receiving water from streams ranging in DOC (0.5-4.5 mg L-1), there were significant differences in bacterial growth, oxygen consumption, and enzyme activities. RAPD analysis showed strongest clustering of samples by stream type with more subtle effects of position along the flowpaths. Responses in community metabolism were always accompanied by shifts in community composition, suggesting carbon supply affects both functional and structural attributes of hyporheic bacterial communities.																	0024-3590					JUL	2003	48	4					1608	1617								WOS:000184247900024		
J	Pulido-Villena, E; Reche, I				Pulido-Villena, E; Reche, I			Exploring bacterioplankton growth and protein synthesis to determine conversion factors across a gradient of dissolved organic matter	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The effect of bacterial specific growth rates of abundance (mu) and protein synthesis (b) on conversion factor (CF) variability was explored in order to provide an alternative approach to the controversial application of just one universal CF to field data. Nine regrowth cultures (RCs) were set up from very diverse aquatic ecosystems, controlling temperature and adding N and P to avoid mineral limitation and force organic carbon limitation. The values of p varied one order of magnitude from 0.26 to 3.34 d(-1), whereas b values varied two orders of magnitude from 0.28 to 34.87 d(-1). We found no relationships between V or b values and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration or the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality indexes assayed. Abundance and protein synthesis increased exponentially and synchronously in four RCs, leading to balanced growth (mu = b). In contrast, abundance and protein synthesis increased logistically in the other five RCs and b values were significantly higher than p values, leading to unbalanced growth (mu not equal b). Us ranged from 0.0062 to 0.0576 x 10(18) cells mol leucine(-1) with an average of 0.0305 x 10(18) cells mol leucine(-1). Us obtained in RCs with balanced growth were generally higher than Us obtained in RCs with unbalanced growth and were not alike, impeding the establishment of an upper limit for Us. A positive and significant relationship (n = 8, p < 0.01**, r(2) = 0.71) was found between Us and DOC concentration (CF (x10(18) cells, mol leucine(-1)) = 0.0104 + 0.0094 DOC (mM)) when the value for the most productive system was excluded. This function permits the estimation of site-specific Us based on DOC concentration instead of the controversial use of a single CIF for different systems.

Two periods have been detected within this data set-years with decreased DOM until the middle of 1980s and then years with increased DOM until 2000. Temperature, hydrological regime of runoff from the catchment (namely the amount of interflow), and changes in atmospheric deposition of acidity coincided with the variations in DOM concentrations. The analysis of single runoff events confirmed the relation between the export of increased DOM concentrations from the catchment and interflow. A multiple linear regression model based on monthly averages of temperature and interflow explained 67% of DOM variability. This model suggested a 7% increase in DOM concentration under the scenarios of possible future climate change related to doubled CO(2) concentration in the atmosphere. The scenarios were based on results of several global circulation models.. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Water samples were collected at six stations including the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimoes and four stations downstream from the confluence. The relative contributions of the two tributaries were determined using a triple tracer approach (delta(18)O, deltaD, Cl-). Particulate (>0.2 mum) and dissolved ( <0.2 mum) concentrations of major elements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Si) and organic carbon (POC and DOC) were measured. Major elements in the particulate fraction were found to have a nonconservative behaviour in the initial stage of the mixing due to mineral removal. In the dissolved fraction, only the DOC, Fe, and Mn behaved nonconservatively. The Fe losses could be due to preferential removal of Fe bound to N-rich organic matter (OM) and/or to preferential removal of Fe oxyhydroxides. The increasing dissolved manganese content in the dissolved phase is explained by a reductive dissolution of manganese oxides due to massive inputs of phenolic-rich OM from the Rio Negro. The amount of DOC removed from the water column in the initial stage of the mixing would represent 4% of the total annual DOC flux of the Amazon River at the reference gauging station of Obidos.

J	Yamamoto, H; Liljestrand, HM; Shimizu, Y; Morita, M				Yamamoto, H; Liljestrand, HM; Shimizu, Y; Morita, M			Effects of physical-chemical characteristics on the sorption of selected endocrine disrnptors by dissolved organic matter surrogates	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sorption coefficients (K-oc values) of selected endocrine disruptors for a wide variety of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were measured using fluorescence quenching and solubility enhancement. 17beta-Estradiol, estriol, 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, p-nonylphenol, p-tert-octylphenol, and dibutylphthalate were selected as endocrine disruptors. Aldrich humic acid, Suwannee River humic and fulvic acids, Nordic fulvic acid, alginic acid, dextran, and tannic acid were selected as DOM surrogates. The resulting sorption coefficients (log K-oc) were independent of octanolwater partitioning coefficients (log K-oc) of the selected endocrine disruptors, indicating the hydrophobic interaction is not the predominant sorption mechanism. Moreover, the K-oc values for the selected endocrine disruptors, especially the steroid estrogens, correlated much better with UV absorptivity at 272 nm (A(272)) and phenolic group concentration of the DOM than with either the H/O or the (O+N)/C atomic ratio of the DOM. This suggests that the sorption mechanism is closely related to the interaction between pi-electrons and the hydrogen bonds, i.e.,the affinity between phenolic groups of the steroid estrogens and DOM is suggested to provide a relatively large contribution to the overall sorption and yield the K-oc values of the steroid estrogens as high as those of the alkylphenols and dibutylphthalate, which are suggested to be dominated by nonspecific hydrophobic interaction.

A plug-flow homogeneous surface diffusion model was applied to determine the intraparticle surface diffusivities of the DOM at different AC-pH combinations. It was found that, for all three ACs, the removal of DOM increased as pH decreased and the increasing extent changed with the ACs used. The pH dependency of the column performance seemed to be attributed more apparently to pH's capability in changing the zeta potential of AC particles. In addition, at all pH levels, the column performance varied markedly with the ACs used. Correlation analyses of the accumulated amounts of DOM onto all three ACs with corresponding pore volumes in several divided pore size regions clearly indicated that pores with sizes 30-100 Angstrom were more effective in adsorbing organic macromolecules. Furthermore, based on model simulations, the sensitivity of bed performance to equilibrium and kinetic parameters was quantified by conducting variance analyses with a four-way classification method.

J	Kisand, V; Wikner, J				Kisand, V; Wikner, J			Combining culture-dependent and -independent methodologies for estimation of richness of estuarine bacterioplankton consuming riverine dissolved organic matter	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Three different methods for analyzing natural microbial community diversity were combined to maximize an estimate of the richness of bacterioplankton catabolizing riverine dissolved organic matter (RDOM). We also evaluated the ability of culture-dependent quantitative DNA-DNA hybridization, a 16S rRNA gene clone library, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to detect bacterial taxa in the same sample. Forty-two different cultivatable strains were isolated from rich and poor solid media. In addition, 50 unique clones were obtained by cloning of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene amplified by PCR from the community DNA into an Escherichia coli vector. Twenty-three unique bands were sequenced from 12 DGGE profiles, excluding a composite fuzzy band of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group. The different methods gave similar distributions of taxa at the genus level and higher. However, the match at the species level among the methods was poor, and only one species was identified by all three methods. Consequently, all three methods identified unique subsets of bacterial species, amounting to a total richness of 97 operational taxonomic units in the experimental system. The confidence in the results was, however, dependent on the current precision of the phylogenetic determination and definition of the species. Bacterial consumers of RDOM in the studied estuary were primarily both cultivatable and uncultivable taxa of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group, a concordant result among the methods applied. Culture-independent methods also suggested several not-yet-cultivated beta-proteobacteria to be RDOM consumers.

This study presents long-term records of organic matter as indicated by water colour that were constructed for three catchments in Northern England for as far back as 1962. Observations show that there have been large increases in DOC concentrations over the period of study with in one case a doubling of the concentration over a period of 29 years. However, in one of the catchments no significant change was observed over a 31-year period. All catchments show common inter-annual control on carbon release in response to droughts, but no step increases in DOC concentrations were observed in response to such perturbations with pre-drought levels being restored within a period 3-4 years. Observed increasing trends do not correlate with changes in river discharge, pH, alkalinity or rainfall, but do coincide with increasing average summer temperatures in the region. The times series of DOC concentration over the period of the record appears stationary, but the distribution of daily values suggests a change in sources of colour over the increasing trend. The evidence supports a view that increases in carbon release are in equilibrium with temperature increases accentuated by land-use factors.																	0168-2563					JUN-JUL	2003	64	2					165	178		10.1023/A:1024924216148						WOS:000184414400002

Electrospray/tandem mass spectrometry of the Tomago Sand Bed hydrophobic acid DOM found an ion series differing by 14 daltons, which is indicative of aliphatic and aryl-aliphatic polycarboxylic acids. The product obtained from ozonation of the resin acid, abietic acid, gave a similar ion series.

Commercial humic substances, DOM from the aeration basin of a wastewater treatment plant, and highly biodegradable DOM (algae or animal extracts) were tested. The bioaccumulation of benzo[a]pyrene was reduced by each DOM (up to 80% reduction with humic substances). Pyrene bioaccumulation was also decreased by each DOM to a lesser extent. Fluoranthene bioaccumulation was affected by the presence of humic acids only. In each experiment, the solution containing humic DOM led to the lowest bioaccumulation. Supposing that only dissolved PAHs were bioavailable, the reduction of bioaccumulation allowed a biological estimate of the partition coefficients of DOM and PAH, K-DOC. The estimated coefficients were positively related to the aromaticity of DOM and negatively related to its biodegradability.																	0730-7268					JUN	2003	22	6					1288	1294		10.1897/1551-5028(2003)022<1288:EODOMO>2.0.CO;2						WOS:000185639100015	12785586

Molecular size distribution and chemical composition of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen were determined in water extracts from humus layers and mineral soils taken from silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. Concentrations of tannins and 15 phenolic acids in the humus layers were measured. Per unit of organic matter, the concentrations of dissolved organic C and N were larger in birch and spruce humus layers than in the pine humus layer. In the underlying mineral soil, the concentrations of dissolved organic C were similar at all sites, but the concentration of dissolved organic N was greater in spruce and pine soils than in birch soil. In all soils, the 10-100 kDa fraction was the most abundant molecular size group and hydrophobic acids the most abundant chemical group of dissolved organic C. In all humus layers, hydrophobic acids and hydrophilic bases were the major components of dissolved organic N. There were only minor differences in the concentrations of total tannins in the humus layers under different tree species. Small-molecule tannins (about < 0.5 kDa) were most abundant in the birch humus, and large-molecule tannins in the pine humus. Coniferous humus contained more ferulic and p -coumaric acids than did the birch humus. The concentrations of 3,4 and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid were similar in all soils.																	1351-0754					JUN	2003	54	2					287	293		10.1046/j.1365-2389.2003.00524.x						WOS:000183032200008		
J	Dittmar, T; Kattner, G				Dittmar, T; Kattner, G			Recalcitrant dissolved organic matter in the ocean: major contribution of small amphiphilics	MARINE CHEMISTRY												For the bulk of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ocean, chemical structure and basic biochemical parameters are largely unknown. To reveal new structural and physicochemical information on DOC, we applied gel permeation chromatography (GPQ in conjunction with a high-sensitivity DOC detector on samples from the Arctic Rivers and Ocean. Carbon-normalized data on molecular size, polarity, charge and aromaticity were obtained for marine-derived and terrigenous refractory compounds in the ocean. The main fraction (60-70%) of riverine DOC exhibited characteristic features of terrigenous humics in terms of aromaticity and molecular mass. Molar UV absorption coefficients (epsilon(OC) at 254 nm) of 72-78 in mol C m(2.)mol(-1) indicated high aromaticity and nominal molecular masses (M-n) were 870-1050 g(.)mol(-1). The remainder was composed mainly of subunits of humics, and of diagenetically fresh biopolymers. In the coastal mixing zone, the hydrodynamic diameter of humics decreased probably due to intramolecular contraction or coiling induced by increases of ion strength and concentration of divalent ions. Aromaticity and the proportion of chromatographic DOC fractions, on the other hand, behaved conservatively, which indicates compositional stability of terrigenous DOC during mixing in the Arctic Ocean. In the deep sea, a main fraction (similar to 60%) of DOC showed characteristic features of aquatic fulvic acids and their subunits, with low molecular masses (M-n similar to 550 g(.)mol(-1)) and low aromaticities (epsilon(OC) similar to 13 m(2.) mol(-1)). The remainder (similar to 40% of DOC) was composed of aliphatic and very small (< 300 g(.)mol(-1)) neutral molecules, largely with hydrophobic functional groups. These molecules have escaped from the analytical window so far because they cannot be isolated via ultrafiltration or XAD resins and do not absorb UV light to be seen by conventional detection. Therefore, a considerable part of dissolved organic matter has very different chemical structures and physicochemical features than previously thought. Most mechanisms that have been suggested to describe the formation of recalcitrant organic matter in the ocean cannot be applied to a major fraction of DOC in the Arctic Ocean.

The methods applied for the characterization of DOM included fluorescence spectroscopy, solid state C-13 CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-GC/MS. The relative abundance of protein-like components and carbohydrates increased from the canal site to more remote freshwater marsh sites suggesting that significant amounts of non-humic DOM are autochthonously produced within the freshwater marshes, and are not exclusively introduced through canal inputs. Such in situ DOM production is important when considering how DOM from canals is processed and transported to downstream estuaries of Florida Bay. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Tremendous strides have been made in the past 25 years to more fully describe the composition of DOM and its role in soil. The papers in this special issue contribute to this literature by both summarizing recent research and reporting on new projects. Based on the papers presented here and others in the literature, I suggest that the following three questions would prove fruitful for future research on DOM in soils: (1) How large are various sources and sinks and how are they controlled?; (2) What is the ecological significance of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in comparison to dissolved organic carbon (DOC)?; (3) How are fluxes altered in human-dominated environments? In support of answering these questions, I recommend that emphasis be placed on developing new analytical techniques (isotopic, or detailed characterization of DOM constituents), increasing interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial biogeochemists and developing an integrated conceptual approach to the study of DOM in soils that addresses interactions among solid soil organic matter, microorganisms including fungi and mycorrhizal fungi, and DOM.

J	Zsolnay, A				Zsolnay, A			Dissolved organic matter: artefacts, definitions, and functions	GEODERMA					International Workshop on Ecological Aspects of Dissolved Organic Matter in Terrestrial Ecosystem	OCT 09-11, 2001	UNIV BAYREUTH, BAYREUTH, GERMANY		UNIV BAYREUTH			In this concept paper, some basic problems in the obtaining of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) are described. Some of them are fairly obvious such as adsorption and desorption on the filters used to isolate DOM. However, some are subtler such as alteration in the tertiary physicochemical structure of DOM because of cavitation (filtration), concentration (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis), or decomposition (electrophoresis). These structure changes may not have an influence on a variety of analytical techniques, but they may alter the ability of DOM to interact with certain ecosystem components such as the biota and pollutants. Therefore, the interpretation of the analyses done with such DOM cannot necessarily be extrapolated to in situ conditions. Fluorescence has been found to be a sensitive tool to follow such tertiary structure changes. In structured matrices with pore spaces such as soils and sediments, DOM may have different fates and functions depending on the pore spaces in which it is located. This again needs to be considered in sampling strategies. For example, DOM in macropores may play important roles in groundwater quality but presumably does not play a major role in the in situ production of the greenhouse gas N2O via denitrification, since this pore space tends to be well aerated. A protocol for the separate sampling of the different pore spaces is presented. Another difficulty, which is shown here, is that minor changes in extraction methodology (such as the extractant-soil ratio) can have a serious effect on the apparent amount of DOM. DOM samples from a field can have considerable temporal and spatial variability, which is complicated by the fact that DOM from unsaturated systems can be strongly influenced by ambient water content. This again needs to be considered, especially when fields from different regions are sampled and compared. Another important point is that the results obtained from one DOM source cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the DOM from another source. For example, soil pore water DOM differs both from aquatic DOM and from the material, which can be extracted as the humic substance fraction. Finally, with the increasing awareness of the ecological functions of DOM, which are briefly presented here, there is also an increase in DOM research being done in different disciplines. This is laudable, but presentations of results need to define DOM more precisely to prevent misunderstandings.

J	Marschner, B; Kalbitz, K				Marschner, B; Kalbitz, K			Controls of bioavailability and biodegradability of dissolved organic matter in soils	GEODERMA					International Workshop on Ecological Aspects of Dissolved Organic Matter in Terrestrial Ecosystem	OCT 09-11, 2001	UNIV BAYREUTH, BAYREUTH, GERMANY		UNIV BAYREUTH			In soils, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is probably the most bioavailable fraction of soil organic matter, since all microbial uptake mechanisms require a water environment. Bioavailability describes the potential of microorganisms to interact with DOM. It is a prerequisite for biodegradation and can be restricted, if DOM is present in small pores or within soil aggregates and therefore not accessible for microorganisms. DOM biodegradation is defined as the utilisation of organic compounds by soil microorganisms quantified by the disappearance of DOM or O(2) or by the evolution of CO(2). The controlling factors for DOM biodegradability can be divided into three groups, namely, intrinsic DOM quality parameters, soil and solution parameters and external factors. DOM characteristics that generally enhance its biodegradability are high contents of carbohydrates, organic acids and proteins for which the hydrophilic neutral fraction seems to be a good estimate. In contrast, aromatic and hydrophobic structures that can also be assessed by UV absorbance decrease DOM biodegradability, either due to their recalcitrance or due to inhibiting effects on enzyme activity. Effects of solution parameters such as Al, Fe, Ca and heavy metal concentrations on DOM biodegradability have been documented in various studies, however with different, sometimes conflicting results. Inhibitory effects of metals are generally attributed to toxicity of the organic complexes or the free metal ions. In contrast, the enhanced degradability observed in the presence of metal ions may be due to flocculation, as larger structures will provide better attachment for microbial colonies. As degradation is dependent on microbial activity, the composition and density of the microbial population used in the degradation studies also influence biodegradation. Site-specific factors, such as vegetation, land use and seasonality of meteorological parameters control DOM composition and soil and soil solution properties and therefore also affect its biodegradability. The major obstacle for a better understanding of the controls of DOM biodegradability is the lack of a standardised methodology or at least systematic comparisons between the large number of methods used to assess DOM biodegradability.

GEODERMA					International Workshop on Ecological Aspects of Dissolved Organic Matter in Terrestrial Ecosystem	OCT 09-11, 2001	UNIV BAYREUTH, BAYREUTH, GERMANY		UNIV BAYREUTH			Nitrate inputs into aquifers may be attenuated by denitrification. This study aims to evaluate the relevance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a substrate for denitrifiers. Seepage water and groundwater were sampled using suction plates, suction cups and multilevel wells and were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and for NO3-. DOM was fractionated and subjected to batch incubations. The investigated soils were three well-drained Plaggic Anthrosols, one Gleyic Podzol and one Eutric Gleysol. Concentrations of DOM ranged from 9 to 32 mg C l(-1) at 90 cm depth. Fluxes of DOM at this depth were between 60 and 90 kg DOC ha(-1) year(-1). Concentrations decreased to 4-7 mg C l(-1) at depths of 3-5.6 m at the well-drained sites. Corresponding DOC fluxes at these depths were between 10 and 20 kg C ha(-1) year(-1). No change in DOC concentrations and fluxes with increasing depth was observed at the poorly drained sites. Because DOM fractions did not change along the flowpath, retention by sorption was probably negligible at these sites. Decreasing NO3- concentrations, which indicate denitrification, were observed at the poorly drained sites and 9-13 m below the groundwater table. During incubation studies, DOC and NO3- concentrations changed little (mean decrease: < 1 mg C l(-1), 0.9 mg N l(-1)). We conclude that DOM leached from soils does not contribute significantly to the natural attenuation of NO3- leached to aquifers because (a) the zones where DOM concentrations and NO3- concentrations decrease are separated spatially and (b) the bioavailability of leached DOM is low.

Since degradation experiments are time consuming, estimating the biodegradability of DOM by more easily measurable properties seems valuable. Our goal was therefore to investigate the biodegradation of DOM of different origin and to relate its extent and rate to properties such as UV absorbance, synchronous and emission scan fluorescence, XAD-8 sorption chromatography and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. We extracted DOM from 13 different samples (maize straw, forest floors, peats, agricultural soils) and carried out a 90-day liquid incubation experiment. DOM biodegradation was quantified by CO(2) evolution. Rapidly and slowly mineralizable portions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a measure of labile and stable DOC and the respective mineralization rate constants and half-lives were calculated by a double exponential model. The extent and rate of DOM biodegradation from less humified organic material (straw, litter and fermentation layers of forest floors) were high resulting in 61-93% of DOC being mineralized. The labile fraction comprised 59-88% of total DOC. DOM extracted from agricultural soils was of an intermediate biodegradability with a CO(2) evolution comprising 17-32% of total DOC. Labile DOC represented 14-25% of total DOC. DOM extracted from peats and Oa forest floor layers was relatively stable (mineralization of 4-9% of total DOC, labile DOC: 3-6%). The half-life of the labile DOC pool was short (2-5 days), whereas that of the stable DOC pool ranged from 0.2 years (DOM from less humified material) to 8.6 years (DOM from the Oa layer under spruce). Extent and rate of DOM biodegradation were closely but nonlinearly related to DOM properties. Solutions exceeding a threshold value of UV absorbance, aromaticity, XAD-8 adsorbable C or of humification indices derived from fluorescence spectra or having carbohydrate contents below a certain level were stable against biodegradation. Relatively simple methods like UV spectroscopy, XAD-8 fractionation and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were suitable to estimate the biodegradation of DOM.

J	Guggenberger, G; Kaiser, K				Guggenberger, G; Kaiser, K			Dissolved organic matter in soil: challenging the paradigm of sorptive preservation	GEODERMA					International Workshop on Ecological Aspects of Dissolved Organic Matter in Terrestrial Ecosystem	OCT 09-11, 2001	UNIV BAYREUTH, BAYREUTH, GERMANY		UNIV BAYREUTH			During the last decade, research in sedimentary systems led to the paradigm of sorptive stabilization of organic matter (OM). Studies on soils also show that sorptive interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and mineral phases contribute to the preservation of soil OM. In the first part of the paper, we summarize evidence for sorptive stabilization of OM in forest soils including (a) pronounced retention of DOM in most subsoils, (b) strong chemisorptive binding exhibiting strong hysteresis, and (c) similarity in the composition of DOM and OM in illuvial soil horizons and clay-sized separates. However, the capacity of soils for sorption of DOM is not infinite. In the second part of the paper, we present a case study where we relate the yearly retention of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the mineral soil to the available sorption capacity of seven forest soils. We estimate that the saturation of the sorption complex would occur within 4-30 years. Assuming these soils are in steady-state equilibrium with respect to carbon cycling, this suggests a mean residence time of the sorbed organic carbon (OC) of about the same time, therefore providing little evidence for a long-term stabilization of sorbed OM. One explanation for this discrepancy may be because in forest soils most surfaces are not characterized by juvenile minerals but are covered with OM and colonized by microorganisms. This is the case mainly in topsoil horizons but occurs also along preferential flow paths and on aggregate surfaces. Biofilms develop particularly at sites receiving high input of nutrients and organic substrates, i.e., DOM, such as preferential flow paths. The OM input enhances the heterotrophic activity in the biofilm, converting the DOM into either organic compounds by microbial resynthesis or inorganic mineralization products. Recent studies suggest that Fe hydrous oxides embedded within the biofilms may serve as a sorbent and shuttle for dissolved organic compounds from the surrounding aqueous media. We assume that sorption of DOM to the biofilm does not lead to a stabilization of OM but is a prerequisite for its rapid turnover. Only when DOM is transported by mass flow or diffusion to fresh, juvenile mineral surfaces, may sorption effectively stabilize OM. This stabilization would involve complexation of functional groups, changed conformation, and incalation in small pores. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

Solid state C-13 cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and C-14 measurements were used to analyse organic matter in solid material and water extracts from the Oi, Oe and Oa horizons, soil leachates collected below the Oe and Oa horizons and throughfall. The DOM in soil leachates from the Oe horizon had a C-14 content that was higher than the water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from the Oi horizon but equal to the C-14 content in the WEOM from the Oe horizon. The C-14 contents in WEOM and DOM from the Oe and Oa horizons were all equal. These results suggest that the DOM leaving the Oe horizon to a large extent had its origin within the Oe horizon itself. NMR spectroscopy showed that WEOM was higher in O-alkyl and lower in aromatic carbon than DOM in soil leachates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

We determined the distribution of Al, Fe(II) and Fe(III) over dissolved 'free' metal, dissolved metal-DOM complexes and metal-DOM precipitates as influenced by solution pH, redox potential and metal/organic carbon (M/C) ratios. For this, we used water extracts of the Oh horizon of a Fimic Anthrosol brought at pH = 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5, and added increasing amounts of Fe(II), Fe(Ill) and Al. For all three metals, soluble metal-DOM complexes were dominant at low M/C ratios (<0.03). At higher M/C ratios, a strong pH effect was observed for Al: at pH=3.5, dissolved 'free' Al was the dominant species, while at pH=4.5, insoluble Al-DOM complexes dominated. For both Fe species, the pH effect was much less pronounced. For Fe(III) at higher M/C ratios, insoluble complexes were the dominant species at all pH values. For Fe(II), very little precipitation was observed and while free metal in solution gained in importance at higher M/C ratios, soluble complexes remained equally important. The differences between Fe(II) and Fe(III) signify the influence of the redox potential of the soil solution. We propose that in horizons where negatively charged sorption sites dominate, cation bridging causes soluble metal-DOM complexation to lead to immobilization of DOM and bound metals, while in horizons where positively charged sites dominate, soluble metal-DOM complexation prevents immobilization by adsorption. Combined with our results and the pH and M/C gradients found in acidic forest soils, this would mean mobilization of Al, Fe and DOM in O, A and E horizons and immobilization in B horizons, as is generally observed in podzols.

The aims of our study were: (i) to determine concentrations and properties of DOM in a series of natural, harvested, and restored peatlands in eastern Quebec and (ii) to relate DOM to CO2 efflux from these bogs. We sampled pore waters at eight peat bogs and determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, humification indices derived from synchronous fluorescence spectra (humification index (HIX), ratio of intensities at 470 and 400 nm), specific absorption at 280 nm, and the humic acid (HA) content. DOC concentrations ranged from 35 to 625 mg C l(-1). The highest values were observed at a block-cut (BC) site where the ditches had been closed to stimulate restoration. This resulted in limited external drainage, DOM accumulation in deeper horizons, and an enrichment of the poorly biodegradable humic acids to about 60% of the bulk DOM. DOC concentrations increased immediately during harvesting up to 188 mg C l(-1) as a result of this ecosystem disturbance. Afterwards, DOC concentrations decreased which might be due to a low content of potential DOM of the remaining little oxidised peat. The enhanced decomposition of the remaining peat during the restoration process seems to be important for a new build-up of potential DOM, which is indicated by reincreasing DOC concentration during the restoration process. We could not relate spectroscopic properties of DOM to peat harvesting and restoration. The portion of humic acids was inversely related to CO2 efflux, indicating low substrate quality of humic acids in pore waters. The seasonal average humification indices of DOM where humic acids had been removed were positively correlated with the seasonal CO2 efflux. from the eight sites, indicating that high respiration results in an enrichment of more aromatic and complex DOM molecules. The relationships suggest that DOM composition affects CO2 efflux from peat bogs and is also driven by respiration and CO2 efflux. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Conditional distribution coefficients (K-DOM'), obtained using an equilibrium dialysis ligand exchange method, were strongly affected by the Hg/DOM concentration ratio. Very strong interactions (K-DOM'= 10(23.2+/-0.5) L kg(-1)), indicative of Hg-thiol bonds, were observed at Hg/DOM ratios below approximately 1 mug Hg per mg DOM. Above approximately 10 mug Hg per mg DOM much lower K-DOM' values (10(10.7+/-0.5) L kg(-1)) were obtained. DOM-Hg interactions were also studied by HgS (log K-sp = -52.4) dissolution and precipitation experiments. In the dissolution experiments, a significant amount of Hg was released from cinnabar in the presence of DOM, suggesting strong interactions. Conversely, precipitation of HgS was strongly inhibited in the presence of low concentrations (less than or equal to 3 mg C/L) of DOM. In both the dissolution and precipitation experiments, organic matter rich in aromatic moieties was more reactive with HgS than less aromatic fractions and sulfur-containing model compounds. These results suggest that DOM can influence the geochemistry of inorganic complexes of Hg in the Everglades, especially HgS, by strong Hg-DOM binding and colloidal stabilization.

Vegetation types sampled included mixtures of Australian native vegetation (Eucalypts) and exotic species (pines) in both sandy and clayey soils. After dilution, the samples were treated with alum, using a jar test procedure. This was used to determine alum doses required for target removal of colour and turbidity. Water samples from the reservoirs were similarly tested using the jar test procedure. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed on freeze-dried material from the raw samples, flocs and treated waters. Pyrolysis products of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were qualitatively compared to those derived from biomacromolecules such as lignin and cellulose. Semi-quantitative comparisons were made on the organic matter component removed by coagulation/flocculation with that recalcitrant to alum treatment. All samples produced relatively large amounts of alkylbenzenes, alkylphenols and polycyclic hydrocarbons. The organic matter that flocculated with alum treatment was determined to be predominantly aromatic, producing methoxyphenols, which were possibly derived from lignin and tannin-like materials. Nitrogen containing compounds were detected from the reservoir-derived DOM but not the terrestrially-derived DOM. Alum treatment had no observed effect on the relative abundance of the detected nitrogenous compounds. The non-coagulable organic matter was found to have a higher proportion of polysaccharide-derived molecular tracer compounds, consistent with a higher hydrophilic character.

Significantly lower K-proportional to values for HDT on the neutral loam soil as compared to the acidic loamy silt soil indicated additional polar interactions between the latter and the basic herbicide metabolite. In dialysis experiments with fulvic acid from silty loam soil (FA) and peat humic acid (HA), a formation of analyte-DOM associates was observed only for HA. The degree of association was characterized by distribution coefficients normalized to the dissolved organic carbon concentration (K-DOC). Values for NP (8,970 L/kg) and BPA (860 L/kg) corresponded with the respective soil sorption coefficients, suggesting similar binding mechanisms in both cases.

J	Ogawa, H; Tanoue, E				Ogawa, H; Tanoue, E			Dissolved organic matter in oceanic waters	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												The amount of information on oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) has increased dramatically in the last decade thanks to the advances in chemical characterizatiotion. This information has supported the development of some novel and important ideas for DOM dynamics in the ocean. Consequently, we have a better understanding of the importance of DOM in oceanic biogeochemical cycles. Here we review studies, published mainly during 1995-2001, synthesize them and discuss unsolved problems and future challenges. The measurement, distribution and turnover of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are presented as the bulk dynamics of the oceanic DOM. The size spectrum, elemental composition, and chemical compositions at molecular and functional group levels are described. The mechanisms proposed for the survival of biomolecules in DOM are discussed.																	0916-8370					APR	2003	59	2					129	147		10.1023/A:1025528919771						WOS:000181195400001

This process mediates the transfer of energy and matter from dissolved organic matter to higher trophic levels, and therefore controls (together with primary production) the productivity of aquatic systems. Here we report experiments on laboratory incubations of sterile filtered river water in which we find that up to 25% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) aggregates abiotically to particles of diameter 0.4-0.8 micrometres, at rates similar to bacterial growth. Diffusion drives aggregation of low- to high-molecular-mass DOC and further to larger micelle-like microparticles. The chemical composition of these microparticles suggests their potential use as food by planktonic bacterivores. This pathway is apparent from differences in the stable carbon isotope compositions of picoplankton and the microparticles. A large fraction of dissolved organic matter might therefore be channelled through microparticles directly to higher trophic levels-bypassing the microbial loop-suggesting that current concepts of carbon conversion in aquatic systems require revision.																	0028-0836					MAR 13	2003	422	6928					150	154		10.1038/nature01469						WOS:000181488900041	12634782

J	Akkanen, J; Kukkonen, JVK				Akkanen, J; Kukkonen, JVK			Measuring the bioavailability of two hydrophobic organic compounds in the presence of dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Bioavailability of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) was studied in natural lake water containing dissolved organic matter (DOM). Lake water was diluted to give a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) range of I to 20 mg/L. Partition coefficients for the model compounds were assessed at different DOM concentrations and over time with three different methods, namely equilibrium dialysis and reverse-phase and liquid-liquid extraction. In addition, biological partition coefficients were estimated from the difference in the bioconcentration of the model compounds in Daphnia magna in the presence and absence of DOM. Results showed that bioavailability of the model compounds was reduced by the presence of DOM. The equilibrium dialysis method gave the best estimates for bioavailability of the model compounds when compared with biologically determined values. Both the reverse-phase and the liquid-liquid extraction overestimated the bioavailable fraction. The more pronounced overestimation of bioavailable fraction of TCB suggested that the sorption of TCB was not only lower but the interaction was also weaker than that of BaP. Increasing DOM concentration produced lower partition coefficients and the effect seemed to be more pronounced when measured by the reverse-phase and the extraction methods.																	0730-7268					MAR	2003	22	3					518	524		10.1897/1551-5028(2003)022<0518:MTBOTH>2.0.CO;2						WOS:000181089000008	12627637	
J	Lang, F; Kaupenjohann, M				Lang, F; Kaupenjohann, M			Effect of dissolved organic matter on the precipitation and mobility of the lead compound chloropyromorphite in solution	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Chloropyromorphite, CPM, Pb-5 (PO4 )(3) Cl, is one of the most insoluble lead minerals. Inducing the formation of CPM by application of phosphate to soil has been suggested for immobilizing Pb at contaminated sites. We have examined the effect of organic matter on the completeness and the rate of CPM precipitation and on the particle size and the mobility of CPM crystals. We did experiments at pH 3-7 and with varying content of dissolved organic C, 0-72 mg C l(-1) , mixing Pb(NO3 )(2) (0.5 mmol l(-1) ) and phosphate (2 mmol l(-1) ) solutions. The organic matter was extracted from samples of a forest floor. The precipitates were identified by X-ray diffraction, and their size and shape were analysed by scanning electron microscopy and by photon correlation spectroscopy. The presence of organic matter in the solutions did not affect the mass of CPM that precipitated within 30 minutes at pH 5, 6 and 7. At pH 3 and 4, however, organic matter strongly inhibited the precipitation. The particles were markedly smaller in solutions containing organic matter than without at all pHs and passed through water-saturated columns filled with calcareous sand, whereas the precipitates from the carbon-free solutions did not. We suggest that the organic matter blocked the surfaces of crystal seeds and impaired crystal growth. At high pH, organic matter may additionally decrease the crystal size of the individual crystals by increasing the number of crystal seeds. We conclude that organic matter in the solution might limit the potential of phosphate to immobilize Pb in soil because it favours the formation of mobile colloids.																	1351-0754					MAR	2003	54	1					139	147		10.1046/j.1365-2389.2003.00505.x						WOS:000181107900012		
J	Luider, C; Petticrew, E; Curtis, PJ				Luider, C; Petticrew, E; Curtis, PJ			Scavenging of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by amorphous iron hydroxide particles Fe(OH)(3(s))	HYDROBIOLOGIA					9th International Symposium on the Interactions between Sediments and Water	MAY 05-10, 2002	BANFF, CANADA					Scavenging of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by particulate metal oxides like Fe(OH)(3(s)) is one of three processes that can influence the concentration and composition of DOM in aquatic systems. The other two possible processes include photodegradation and biodegradation. In combination, these processes alter the concentration and composition of DOM systematically with increasing time, measured as hydrologic residence time (HRT). The objective of this research was to determine the change in Fe(OH)(3(s))- scavengable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with increasing HRT (0 - 80 yr). In addition, DOC from allochthonous and autochthonous sources were included in this study. The susceptibility of DOC from surface waters to scavenging by Fe(OH)(3(s)) was found to decrease as a function of HRT, from approximately 90% to 79%. The lowest HRT system was operationally considered equivalent to allochthonous DOC, while autochthonous DOC was scavenged similarly to DOC from the 80 yr HRT system. These results indicate that scavenging of bulk DOC may be limited by metal loading in aquatic systems, and that the bulk of Fe(OH)(3(s))- reactive DOC is from allochthonous sources. In addition, all surface waters treated with Fe(OH)(3(s)) contained approximately 1 mg l(-1) of DOC that was resistant to scavenging (SD = 0.50, n = 5), which suggests that a refractory fraction of DOC persists in surface waters.																	0018-8158					MAR	2003	494	1-3					37	41		10.1023/A:1025473122729						WOS:000185029300007

J	Moon, JW; Goltz, MN; Ahn, KH; Park, JW				Moon, JW; Goltz, MN; Ahn, KH; Park, JW			Dissolved organic matter effects on the performance of a barrier to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon transport by groundwater	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In order to contain the movement of organic contaminants in groundwater, a subsurface sorption barrier consisting of sand or clay minerals coated with a cationic surfactant has been proposed. The effectiveness of such a sorption barrier might be affected by the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the groundwater. To study the impact of DOM on barrier performance, a series of batch experiments were,performed by measuring naphthalene and phenanthrene sorption onto sand coated with cetylpyridinium. chloride (CPC) and bentonite coated with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) in the presence of various concentrations of DOM. The overall soilwater distribution coefficient (K*) of naphthalene and phenanthrene onto CPC-coated sand decreased with increasing DOM concentration, whereas the K* of the compounds onto HDTMA-coated bentonite slightly increased with increasing DOM concentration. To describe the overall distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the systems, a competitive multiphase sorption (CMS) model was developed and compared with an overall mechanistic sorption (OMS) model. The modeling studies showed that while the OMS model did not explain the CPC-coated sand experimental results, a model that included competitive sorption between DOM and PAH did. The experimental results and the modeling study indicated that there was no apparent competition between DOM and PAH in the HDTMA-coated bentonite system, and indicated that in groundwater systems with high DOM, a barrier using HDTMA-coated bentonite might be more effective.

In most adsorption studies, water soluble organic matter extracted by water or dilute salt solutions is used instead of real DOM gained in situ by lysimeters or ceramic suction cups. We investigated the adsorption of DOM gained in situ from three compartments (forest floor leachate and soil solution from 20 cm (Bg horizon) and 60 cm depth (2Bg horizon)) on the corresponding clay and fine silt fractions (< 6.3 mum, separated together from the bulk soil) of the horizons Ah, Bg, and 2Bg of a forested Stagnic Gleysol by batch experiments. An aliquot of each clay and fine silt fraction was treated with H2O2 to destroy soil organic matter. Before and after the experiments, the solutions were characterized by ultra-violet and fluorescence spectroscopy and analyzed for sulfate, chloride, nitrate, and fluoride. The highest affinity for DOM was found for the Ah samples, and the affinity decreased in the sequence Ah > Bg > 2Bg. Dissolved organic matter in the 2Bg horizon can be regarded as slightly reactive, because adsorption was low. Desorption of DOM from the subsoil samples was reflected more realistically with a non-linear regression approach than with initial mass isotherms. The results show that the extent of DOM adsorption especially in subsoils is controlled by the composition and by the origin of the DOM used as adsorptive rather than by the mineralogical composition of the soil or by contents of soil organic matter. We recommend to use DOM gained in situ when investigating the fate of DOM in subsoils.

J	Guo, MX; Chorover, J				Guo, MX; Chorover, J			Transport and fractionation of dissolved organic matter in soil columns	SOIL SCIENCE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds that plays an important role in the movement of DOM-associated pollutants. In this study, transport and fractionation of DOM in soils was investigated in flow-through soil columns. Dissolved organic matter derived from spent mushroom substrate weathering was pumped through packed columns (2.5 cm X 10 cm) comprising a coarse-loamy subsoil (mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludult), and effluents were monitored for changes in the composition of DOM. Effluent DOM was characterized for LTV absorbance, molecular weight, acidity, and hydrophilicity. Transport through the columns resulted in preferential retention of specific DOM constituents as indicated by comparison with a Br- tracer. During the transport process, effluent DOM exhibited decreasing values of E-2/E-3 (from 10.3 to 6.2), acidity (from 20.8 to 13.1 mmol(c) g(-1) C), and hydrophilicity (39.0 to 28.4%), and increasing values of molar absorptivity (from 164 to 310 L mol(-1) C cm(-1)) and number and weight-averaged molecular weight (from 1770 to 3150 and 2450 to 4180 Da, respectively). These results indicate that DOM fractions with higher molecular weight, higher molar absorptivity, lower E-2/E-3 ratio, lower acidity, and lower hydrophilicity were adsorbed preferentially by soil minerals, whereas the inverse fractions were transported preferentially. The adsorbed DOM could not be completely desorbed by DOM-free background solution, indicating a strongly bound fraction. Sorptive fractionation of DOM during transport likely affects the transport behavior of DOM-complexed constituents.																	0038-075X	1538-9243				FEB	2003	168	2					108	118		10.1097/00010694-200302000-00005						WOS:000181023000005		
J	Amon, RMW; Benner, R				Amon, RMW; Benner, R			Combined neutral sugars as indicators of the diagenetic state of dissolved organic matter in the Arctic Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was sampled by tangential flow ultrafiltration from different basins in the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian (GIN) Seas, and the estuaries of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from more than 500 muM C in the rivers to about 50 muM C in the deep basins. Arctic Mediterranean Sea (AMS) surface water DOC concentrations ranged from 66 to 137 muM C. High concentrations in surface waters were due mainly to river discharge of terrigenous DOC, while elevated concentrations in AMS deep water likely reflect downwelling of DOM in this system. Total hydrolyzable neutral sugar concentrations were similar to7-fold higher in ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) from estuaries (1200 nM) than in Arctic ocean surface waters (160 nM), but carbon-normalized neutral sugar yields (% OC) were lower in the estuaries indicating that marine DOM sources were relatively rich in neutral sugars. Depth profiles of neutral sugar concentrations and carbon-normalized yields indicated that carbohydrates were produced and consumed largely in surface waters of the AMS. These observations were consistent with rapid bacterial degradation of neutral sugars during decomposition experiments. The molecular composition of neutral sugars was very similar among AMS surface samples and showed only minimal differences between terrestrial and marine UDOM, indicating that the neutral sugar composition is not useful for distinguishing these sources. It appears diagenetic processes rather than sources are primarily responsible for determining neutral sugar compositions in UDOM. Neutral sugar compositions in all of the UDOM samples analyzed in this study were indicative of heteropolysaccharides. The strong relationship between neutral sugars and the diagenetic state of DOM was best represented by neutral sugar yields (% OC), which were used as a quantitative indicator for the amount of labile DOM in the AMS. Based on the low average neutral sugar yield (5.5% OC) in UDOM from AMS surface waters, we estimated that only similar to2.2% of the DOC was of labile nature. This value was lower than for surface waters of the Ross Sea and Atlantic and Pacific Oceans suggesting DOM is less bioavailable and the microbial loop is less active in AMS surface waters.

J	Hung, JJ; Chen, CH; Gong, GC; Sheu, DD; Shiah, FK				Hung, JJ; Chen, CH; Gong, GC; Sheu, DD; Shiah, FK			Distributions, stoichiometric patterns and cross-shelf exports of dissolved organic matter in the East China Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper sets out to elucidate distributions, stoichiometric patterns and cross-shelf exports of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the East China Sea (ECS). Surface distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ECS varied spatially, ranging from 85 to 120 muM in the China Coastal Water (CCW), from 75 to 85 muM in the Kuroshio Water (KW), and from 60 to 70 muM in the upwelling water. DOC concentrations in most regions of the shelf mixed water (SMW) were between 72 and 85 muM. Temporal variations were insignificant with the exception of the CCW, where the concentration was greater in summer and autumn than in spring and winter. Spatial patterns of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) were less variable in the spring season, ranging from 6 to 9 muM for DON and 0.15 to 0.25 muM for DOP. The elemental ratios of DOC, DON and DOP are much greater than the Redfield ratio, ranging from 8.9 to 15.3 for C/N, from 19 to 83.6 for N/P and from 200 to 853 for C/P. Such ratios also showed a general increase with depth. However, the slopes of linear regression of DOM pairs become smaller and were about 8.4 for DeltaDOC/DeltaDON, 19 for DeltaDON/DeltaDOP and 129 for DeltaDOC/DeltaDOP, suggesting the possible ratios derived from the recently produced fraction. Vertical increases of ratios in DOM pairs may suggest that the recycling of DOP and DON is more rapid than that of DOC to overcome the biological overconsumption of DIC to DIN and DIP (DeltaNDIC:DeltaNDIN:DeltaNDIP = 1:14.3:129), as the ratio of DeltaPOC/DeltaPON (6.74) approaches the Redfield ratio in the euphotic zone. Degradation rates of DOC and DOP are variable with water types and are generally greater for the CCW than for the KW, suggesting the different lability of DOM in various waters. The residence times of bulk DOC, DON, and DOP in the shelf are about 1.10, 0.98, and 0.92 yr, respectively, which are close to the ranges of the mean residence time of shelf water reported previously, suggesting that there is little to no export off the shelf. Finally, total inputs are closely balanced by total outputs for bulk DOC, DON, and DOP in the ECS shelf, if temporal variations of DON and DOP are negligible. However, net exports across the shelf are highly probable if only labile and semi-labile DOC (3.8 +/- 0.6 x 10(12) g C yr(-1)), DON (482 +/- 160 x 10(9) g N yr(-1)), and DOP (37.5 +/- 18.5 x 10(9) g P yr(-1)) are involved in the budget calculation. The ECS shelf is likely to be a small source of degradable DOM for oceanic waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (APESI-MS) was evaluated as a potential too[ for direct measurement of the total suite of individual dissolved organic matter (DOM) compounds in rainwater. The APESI-MS response was linear to all DOM compounds of atmospheric significance examined as standard solutions. Urban precipitation samples from New Brunswick, NJ (USA) were analyzed by APESI-MS over the mass-to-charge (m/z) range 50-3000. Over 95% of the m/z ions detected were in the low m/z range (50-500). Over 300 unique m/z ions were detected across the 11 rainwater samples indicating the complexity of the mixture of DOM in rainwater. Forty percent of the organic bases (positive mode detection) and 22% of the organic acids (negative mode) occurred in at least 6 of the 11 rainwater samples. Ions corresponding to the m/z of carboxylic acids standards (nonanedioic acid; 1,4-butanedicarboxylic acid; pentanedioic acid; hydroxybutanedioic acid; and butanedioic acid) and to reduced N standards (allylurea; caffeine; imidazole; and N-2-propenylurea) occurred in at least one of the 11 rainwater samples. Total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) estimated from the APESI-MS analysis and measured by standard DOC methods were not statistically different.																	0013-936X					JAN 1	2003	37	1					131	137		10.1021/es025848x						WOS:000180246200036	12542301	
J	Biddanda, BA; Cotner, JB				Biddanda, BA; Cotner, JB			Enhancement of dissolved organic matter bioavailability by sunlight and its role in the carbon cycle of Lakes Superior and Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The degree to which sunlight and microbes interact in the cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of natural waters is unclear. During 1999 and 2000, the effects of sunlight on the lability of DOM in two of the Laurentian Great Lakes were examined. Bacteria-free (<0.2 pm) water samples collected in Lake Superior and Lake Michigan were exposed to ambient sunlight for several days and subsequently inoculated (1:10) with <1.0 mum lake water containing natural bacteria and assayed for bacterial growth rates (H-3-leucine incorporation into protein) in the dark. Exposure of water collected from offshore surface layers to sunlight caused a net reduction of DOM bioavailability (bacterial growth similar to20 to 30% of dark control), whereas both exposure of deep water and river water to sunlight resulted in a net enhancement of DOM bioavailability (bacterial growth similar to150 to 260% of dark control). Irradiated water from nearshore exhibited an intermediate response in terms of changes in DOM bioavailability (bacterial growth similar to75 to 115% of dark control). Despite the reduction of DOM bioavailability in surface waters by sunlight exposure in the short-term (relative to dark control), subsequent incubation of these waters in the dark increased bacterial production rates relative to in situ rates, suggesting that the net effect of exposure to sunlight, even in surface waters, was to increase DOM bioavailability. Rapid and sustained photochemical alterations of DOM bioavailability occurring in the euphotic zone of natural waters should accelerate the turnover of surface water, older deep water, and refractory terrigenous carbon.																	0380-1330						2003	29	2					228	241								WOS:000183819000003		
J	Benner, R; Kaiser, K				Benner, R; Kaiser, K			Abundance of amino sugars and peptidoglycan in marine particulate and dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Several recent studies indicated that amino sugars were likely to be major components of marine carbon and nitrogen cycles, but there has been insufficient data to investigate this hypothesis. In the present study, hydrolyzable amino sugars were measured in a variety of marine organisms and particulate organic matter (POM) and in ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) from various ocean basins and depths. Glucosamine (GlcN) and galactosamine (GalN) were abundant and common to all samples. Concentrations of these two amino sugars were similar to their neutral sugar counterparts, glucose and galactose, and in surface water they accounted for up to similar to1.5% of C and N in POM and 2.5% of C and 7.1% of N in UDOM. Chitin, a polymer of glucosamine, is produced by many marine organisms, but based on the low GlcN: GalN ratios (1.0-2.5) in POM and UDOM, it does not appear to be a primary source of glucosanune in these samples. Muramic acid, an amino sugar found only in the bacterial cell wall polymer peptidoglycan, was relatively abundant in POM, indicating that bacterial detritus is a principal component of submicron particles in seawater. Muramic acid was measured in all UDOM samples, but its concentrations were low (<1 nmol L-1), indicating that intact fragments of peptidoglycan were a relatively minor component of UDOM. The abundance of GlcN and GalN and their similar concentrations in POM and UDOM provide novel information suggesting a major prokaryotic source.

J	Guo, LD; Tanaka, N; Schell, DM; Santschi, PH				Guo, LD; Tanaka, N; Schell, DM; Santschi, PH			Nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter in marine environments	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												High-molecular-weight (HMW) dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated using cross-flow ultrafiltration from seawater across a salinity gradient in 2 estuarine/coastal marine environments-Chesapeake Bay/Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) and Galveston Bay/Gulf of Mexico. Nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C) were measured on the isolated HMW DOM samples (defined here as the size fraction between 1 and 200 nm), which made up similar to50 to 60 % of the total DOM in the estuarine regions and decreased to similar to35 % of the DOM at the MAB and Gulf of Mexico stations. delta(15)N values varied from 4.8 to 8.1 parts per thousand in the Chesapeake Bay/MAB area. In the Galveston Bay/Gulf of Mexico region, delta(15)N and delta(13)C values varied from 3.2 to 9.5 parts per thousand. and -26.1 to -20.9 parts per thousand, respectively. Similar distribution patterns of delta(13)C and delta(15)N were observed in both study areas, with values of delta(15)N showing a mid-salinity maximum of about 8 to 10parts per thousand, whereas delta(13)C continually increased with increasing salinity. The delta(13)C Values clearly demonstrated a shift of HMW organic carbon sources from largely terrestrial inputs in the upper-estuarine areas to marine-dominated organic carbon sources in lower-estuarine and coastal regions. The more complicated distribution patterns of delta(15)N, with delta(15)N values first increasing with salinity in estuarine regions then decreasing towards the seawater endmember, suggest more dynamic N cycling. Thus, in addition to organic matter sources, biogeochemical and isotopic fractionation processes are important factors governing marine HMW DOM delta(15)N values. Vertical profiles of HMW DOM delta(13)C in open-ocean stations generally decrease from surface water to deep waters, whereas the opposite was found for delta(15)N. HMW DOM components with heavier delta(13)C and lighter delta(15)N values seem to be preferentially degraded during their transport from surface to deep waters. However, other processes could also have contributed to this distribution trend. While the carbon isotopic signature can be used as an indicator of DOM sources, nitrogen isotopic composition, on the other hand, appears to be related to both source functions and subsequent recycling in marine environments. Comparisons of delta(15)N with previously published Delta(14)C values for the same samples support these conclusions about possible N-15 degradation pathways.

J	Sipelgas, L; Arst, H; Kallio, K; Erm, A; Oja, P; Soomere, T				Sipelgas, L; Arst, H; Kallio, K; Erm, A; Oja, P; Soomere, T			Optical properties of dissolved organic matter in Finnish and Estonian lakes	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												The main objective of the present study is to test various methods for describing the absorption spectra of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and to determine the numerical values of some optical parameters of CDOM in lakes with diverse water quality. First, the parameters of an exponential model in different spectral intervals were determined. In addition, the suitability of some other models for the approximation of CDOM spectra was estimated. Specific absorption coefficients of CDOM were calculated from the absorption coefficients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. The experimental initial data were differences between spectral attenuation coefficients of filtered and distilled water. Two datasets were used: 1) for 13 Estonian and 7 Finnish lakes (altogether 404 spectra between 350 and 700 nm) measured by the Estonian Marine Institute (EMI); 2) for 10 Finnish lakes (73 spectra) measured by the Finnish Environment Institute (FEI). The spectra of CDOM absorption coefficients (a(CDOM)) were calculated from experimental data taking into account the correction due to scattering properties of colloids in the filtered water. The total content of CDOM in natural waters of Estonian and Finnish lakes was expressed by means of a(CDOM) at the wavelength of 380 nm. It varied significantly, from 0.71 to 19.5 m(-1), the mean value (of all the investigated lakes) being around 6.6 m(-1). Slopes of the exponential approximation varied widely, from 0.006 to 0.03 nm(-1). Averaged over all lakes values of slope for the interval 380-500 nm obtained from the EMI dataset are close to those obtained from the FEI dataset: from 0.014 nm(-1) (without correction) to 0.016-0.017 nm(-1) (with different types of correction). These results are in good correspondence with most published data. Attempts to describe the spectra in the region of 350-700 nm by means of hyperexponential functions (similar to exp(-alphalambdaeta)) show that: (1) eta < I (in the case of traditional exponential approximation eta = 1); (2) a promising idea is to seek the best fit only for wavelengths lambda > lambda(1), where lambda(1) will be chosen taking into account the real shape of a(CDOM) spectra. The mean value of the specific absorption coefficient (a*(CDOM)) at the wavelength 380 nm obtained in this study (0.44 L mg(-1) m(-1)) is close to the values published in the literature, if we assume that a*(CDOM) (380) is calculated using the data of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The optically non-active fraction of DOM in our study was high and therefore a*(CDOM) (380) was considerably higher (1.01 L mg(-1) m(-1)) than a*(CDOM) (380). The results of the present work could be used in the modeling of underwater light field as well as in the interpretation of radiation measurements and optical remote sensing results.

J	Wakeham, SG; Pease, TK; Benner, R				Wakeham, SG; Pease, TK; Benner, R			Hydroxy fatty acids in marine dissolved organic matter as indicators of bacterial membrane material	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Samples of ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) from the equatorial Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea were analyzed for lipid biomarkers to evaluate potential inputs from bacterial membrane lipids. Acid hydrolysis released a series of C-12-C-20 fatty acids and C-10-C-18 beta-hydroxy fatty acids (3-hydroxy acids), with total acid (fatty + hydroxy) concentrations of 0.039-0.31 nM or about 0.006-0.087% of ultrafiltered dissolved organic carbon (UDOC). beta-hydroxy acids comprised from 6 to 91% of total (fatty + hydroxy) acids in UDOM. Short-chain beta-hydroxy acids of this type are constituents of the structural lipopolysaccharide biopolymers of bacterial membranes, especially in Gram negative species. The data suggest that bacterial membrane-derived lipid material may be a component of marine DOM, and our results point to the need for additional lipid analyses of marine UDOM to better characterize its source(s).

J	Nierop, KGJ; Jansen, B; Verstraten, JA				Nierop, KGJ; Jansen, B; Verstraten, JA			Dissolved organic matter, aluminium and iron interactions: precipitation induced by metal/carbon ratio, pH and competition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												To better understand the precipitation behaviour of dissolved organic matter induced by interactions with metals, a systematic titration experiment was conducted mimicking the soil solution conditions in an acidic, sandy soil. The variables of interest included the type of metal species (Al, Fe), the redox state [Fe(II), Fe(III)], the pH (3.5, 4.0, 4.5), the metal to organic carbon (M/C) ratio and the competition between Al and Fe. Precipitation of DOM-Al appeared to be strongly correlated with M/C ratio and the pH. For Fe(II) only little precipitation occurred, while the strongest flocculation degree was found after addition of Fe(III). In contrast to Al, hardly any correlation between DOM-Fe precipitation and pH was observed. Both reduction and oxidation of Fe was found and exhibited a strong effect on the precipitated amounts of DOM and Fe. In competition, Al determined the precipitation behaviour at lower M/C ratios (< 0.10), while at higher M/C ratios Fe determined the flocculation. Below a M/C ratio of 0.06 Al was the dominant metal in the precipitates, especially at lower pH levels, while the opposite trend was found at M/C ratios above 0.06. Overall, Fe(III) gave the strongest flocculation, although Al influenced the impact of Fe(III) interactions with DOM in relation to pH and M/C ratio. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Wang, Y; Hsieh, YP; Landing, WM; Choi, YH; Salters, V; Campbell, D				Wang, Y; Hsieh, YP; Landing, WM; Choi, YH; Salters, V; Campbell, D			Chemical and carbon isotopic evidence for the source and fate of dissolved organic matter in the northern Everglades	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Surface waters in the Florida Everglades contain high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds. delta(13)C values of DOC samples collected from the northern Everglades indicate that less than about 23% of the DOC was derived from sugarcane (the dominant agricultural crop in the area), and the amount of DOC from sugarcane was greater during the dry period. Most of the DOC (>50%) in the northern Everglades was in the low molecular weight (< 1000 Dalton) fraction (LMW-DOC). The relative amount of high molecular weight DOC (HMW-DOC) was higher in the wet period than in the dry period. Radiocarbon ages of the DOC ranged from "> modern" to about 2400 years B.P., indicating that DOC was derived from both historic peat deposits and modern vegetation. At each site, the HMW-DOC had older radiocarbon ages than the LMW-DOC, and therefore contained a greater fraction of DOC derived from the historic peat deposits. It appears that at least some of the old DOC compounds from the historic peat deposits were decomposed during their residence in the surface water system in the northern Everglades, and the LMW-DOC was more microbially labile than the HMW-DOC. Our analysis suggests that accelerated decomposition of organic matter in the historic peat deposits (due to land-use change) could be a significant source of DOC and nutrients in the northern Everglades. Our data also suggest that the radiocarbon signature of DOC could be used as a sensitive indicator of the overall effectiveness of a wetland restoration project.

J	Nierop, KGJ; Jansen, B; Vrugt, JA; Verstraten, JM				Nierop, KGJ; Jansen, B; Vrugt, JA; Verstraten, JM			Copper complexation by dissolved organic matter and uncertainty assessment of their stability constants	CHEMOSPHERE												The interaction of Cu with dissolved organic matter (DOM, extracted from an organic forest floor) was investigated and the resulting data was evaluated in terms of their uncertainty. The speciation of Cu over 'free' Cu (as analysed by diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT)), dissolved Cu-DOM complexes and precipitated Cu-DOM was determined as a function of pH (3.5, 4.0 and 4.5) and Cu/C ratio. The dissolved organically bound fraction was highest at pH 4.5, but this fraction decreased with increasing Cu/C ratio, which was observed for all pH levels. In the range of Cu/C = 7 x 10(-5)-2.3 x 10(-2) (mol/mol) the precipitated fraction was very small. The speciation of both Al and Fe was not affected by increasing Cu concentrations. From a continuous distribution model using the Scatchard. approach, we calculated the optimal fit and corresponding upper and lower 95% uncertainty bounds of the overall stability constants (K-o) with the shuffled complex evolution Metropolis (SCEM) algorithm. Although the optimal equation fitted the data very well, the uncertainty of the, according to literature, most reliable approach to establish stability constants, was still large. Accordingly, the usually reported intrinsic stability constants exhibited large uncertainty ranging from logK(i) = 6.0-7.1 (optimal 6.7) for pH 3.5, logK(i) = 6.5-7.1 (optimal 6.8) for pH 4.0, and logK(i) = 6.4-7.2 (optimal 6.8) for pH 4.5 and showed only little effect of pH.
