However, chemical and structural heterogeneities of DOM derived from rice straw are not well characterized. The aim of this paper was to study the chemical and structural characteristics of DOM derived from rice straw at the different stages of decay. A total of ten different DOM samples were obtained from aerobic biodegrading rice straw for ten different incubation times. Glass bottles contained a certain amount of rice straw, quartz sand, inoculum, and distilled water were placed on an incubator. At each time of interval, five replicate reactors were taken from the incubator and each was filled with 60 ml distilled water and shaken. After centrifugation, the supernatant was withdrawn from each replicate reactor and filtered through a 0.45-mu m membrane filter. The filtrates were analyzed for chemical and structural characteristics of the DOMs using elemental analyzer, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and (1)H, (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results showed that the contents of dissolved organic carbon decreased dramatically in the early stage (from day 0 to day 3), then increased nearly linearly till day 63, and finally leveled off at about 22-24 mg g(-1) straw (from day 63 to day 180). The FTIR spectroscopy data indicated that the functional groups of the DOM samples were characterized by carboxyl, aliphatic, and aromatic groups. The elemental composition showed that the H/C atomic ratios decreased as a function of decay time, indicating aromaticity of DOM increased with decay time. The (1)H, (13)C-NMR spectra showed that the contents of carbohydrates decreased while the contents of aromatic groups increased as straw decay proceeded, suggesting carbohydrates were consumed faster than aromatic groups by microorganisms. Our results indicate that the DOM derived from rice straw are highly heterogeneous in terms of their structural and functional groups, and aromatic groups remain longer than other groups do, suggesting that the aromatic groups represent the stable portion of DOM.																	1439-0108					JUL	2010	10	5			SI		915	922		10.1007/s11368-010-0210-x						WOS:000278741300015

Whole-water (i.e., unfractionated) DOM was analyzed pre- and post-irradiation using ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), revealing the following three pools of DOM classified based upon their photoreactivity: (1) photo-resistant, (2) photo-labile, and (3) photo-produced. Photo-resistant DOM was heterogeneous, with most molecular classes represented, although only a small number of aromatics and no condensed aromatics were identified. The photo-produced pool was dominated by aliphatic compounds, although it included a small number of aromatics, including condensed aromatics. Aromatic compounds were the most photoreactive, with. 90% being lost upon irradiation. Photochemistry also resulted in a significant drop in the number of molecules identified and a decrease in their structural diversity. The FT-ICR MS signatures of two classes of refractory organic matter, black carbon and carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), were present in the sample prior to irradiation, indicating that the Congo River could be a significant exporter of recalcitrant DOM to the ocean. All black carbon-like molecules identified in the initial sample were lost during irradiation. Molecular signatures consistent with CRAM were also highly photo-labile, demonstrating that environmental solar irradiation levels are capable of removing these refractory compounds from aquatic systems. Irradiation also shifted the molecular signature of terrestrial DOM toward that of marine DOM, thereby complicating the task of tracking terrestrial DOM in the ocean.

Winter to spring variations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in a temperate estuary (Po River, northern Adriatic Sea)	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The light absorbing fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), known as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) showed wide seasonal variations in the temperate estuarine zone in front of the Po River mouth. DOC concentrations increased from winter through spring mainly as a seasonal response to increasing phytoplankton production and thermohaline stratification. The monthly dependence of the CDOM light absorption by salinity and chlorophyll a concentrations was explored In 2003, neither DOC nor CDOM were linearly correlated with salinity, due to an exceptionally low Po river inflow Though the CDOM absorbance coefficients showed a higher content of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in 2004 with respect to 2003. the spectroscopic features confirmed that the qualitative nature of CDOM was quite similar in both years CDOM and DOC underwent a conservative mixing. only after relevant Po river freshets, and a change in optical features with an increase of the specific absorption coefficient was observed, suggesting a prevailing terrestrial origin of dissolved organic matter.

Macroalgae are essential producers in aquatic ecosystems. They can release a considerable part of photosynthetic products as CDOM. So changes in optical properties of CDOM are studied on filamentous green macroalgae-Chadophorasle found in tidal flats of a brackish Lake Beihu in natural field condition by using spectrometry. Humic-like fluorescence peaks and protein-like fluorescence peaks detected by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectrum (EEMS) change little in control experiment but increase dramatically in incubation experiment. Applying parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) together with fluorescence excitation-emission matrix can get four components of CDOM (C(1), C(2) C(3) and C(4)) which are relative to humic-like fluorescence peak A(C), M and protein-like fluorescence peak B, T respectively. In incubation experiment four components increase by 211.5%, 255.8%, 75.3% and 129.3% respectively while in control experiment components have little changes except C(1) decreasing by 34.3%. Absorption coefficient a(355) increases by 92.9% and has positive significant correlation(P<0.01) with the four components in incubation experiment while a(355) decreases by 59.8% and only has correlation (P<0.05) with C(1) in control experiment. As the parameters representing CDOM molecular weight and composition, M and S values in incubation experiment are smaller than in control experiment, which illustrate that aromatic and macromolecular CDOM is produced in growth of Chadophorasle. All results indicate that growth of Chadophorasle can change the content and composition of CDOM.

The dissociation kinetics of Cu-dissolved organic matter complexes from soil and soil amendments	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												Complexes between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and copper (Cu) that dissociate very slowly can theoretically facilitate Cu leaching to the groundwater. Data on dissociation kinetics of Cu-DOM complexes present in soil and in soil amendments are limited. The dissociation kinetics of different Cu-DOM complexes from soil, wastewater, pig manure and sewage sludge was measured with the Competitive Ligand Exchange Method (CLEM) and Diffusive Gradient in Thin films (DGT) technique. The solutions were set at constant pH, Ca concentration and free Cu(2+) activity to allow comparison between the different samples. The average dissociation rate constant k(d) of the complexes, as measured by CLEM, was about 10(-3) s(-1) and the fractions of dissolved Cu that were undissociated after 8h ranged from <1% to 25%. These fractions determined by CLEM were significantly correlated with the non-labile fractions (0-82%) determined in the DGT tests and data analysis show that DGT data can be predicted from CLEM data. The dissociation rates decreased when Cu-DOM complexes had been equilibrated at lower Cu(2+) activities. Increasing the Cu-DOM contact time (7-297 days) decreased the dissociation rate. The non-labile fractions were positively correlated with the specific UV absorbance suggesting that aromatic moieties in DOM hold non-labile Cu. All natural Cu-DOM complexes contained a detectable fraction with a dissociation rate constant k(d) lower than 10(-5) s(-1) which can theoretically lead to non-equilibrium conditions and leaching risks in soil.

The fluorescent DOM determined by three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and the trans-membrane pressure (IMP) under different SRT operation were investigated, and the correlations between them were analyzed. The results showed that the variations of fluorescent DOM (Peaks B and C) in the sludge supernatants correlated well with the variations of EEM spectra signal of bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) even though they were different in nature, i.e., the bound EPS were found to be more non-biodegradable than DOM. The fluorescent intensity (FI) variations of Peaks A and B in the EEM spectra of DOM were closely related to the IMP increase rate (membrane fouling) in the MBR, suggesting that they might be used to monitor the DOM variations and to indicate MBR performance. Through the EEM spectra analysis, it was confirmed in this work that the DOM in the sludge supernatants was not only originated from the bound EPS but also from the influent wastewater.

J	Omori, Y; Hama, T; Ishii, M; Saito, S				Omori, Yuko; Hama, Takeo; Ishii, Masao; Saito, Shu			Relationship between the seasonal change in fluorescent dissolved organic matter and mixed layer depth in the subtropical western North Pacific	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Spatial and temporal distributions of marine humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOMM) were determined in the subtropical western North Pacific to evaluate the controlling factors of FDOMM behaviors. The observations were conducted at 4 stations (15-30 degrees N) along 137 E in a subtropical area between January 2006 and April 2007. The florescence intensity of FDOMM was low (0.14-0.25 quinine sulfate units (QSU)) in the surface layer probably due to photodegradation, and increased with depth (0.90-1.10 QSU at 1000 m), irrespective of season and station. In the surface layer, the thickness of the water mass with low fluorescence intensity (<0.3 QSU) showed the seasonal change by being deeper in winter and shallower in summer, depending on the mixed layer depth (MLD). The average fluorescence intensity within the mixed layer also varied seasonally at midlatitudes; the intensity in summer was 40.8-53.8% of that in winter. Since the MLD was very much shallower in summer than in winter, FDOMM in the mixed layer would be kept within a shallow depth during the summer where intensive photodegradation could occur. The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) was at its maximum at the water surface and decreased with depth, being adverse to FDOMM. Thus, the ratio of fluorescence intensity to TOC concentration was lowest (0.002-0.003) in surface water, which implies that FDOMM is not quantitatively important to the dissolved organic carbon pool. However, considering the possible difference in the stabilities of FDOMM against photochemical and microbial degradation, it is conceivable that photobleached FDOMM is one of the important organic groups constituting marine dissolved organic matter.																	0148-0227					JUN 2	2010	115								C06001	10.1029/2009JC005526						WOS:000278454100001

DOM in both surface and groundwater from the eastern Everglades S332 basin reflected a terrestrial-derived fingerprint through dominantly higher abundances of humic-like PARAFAC components. In contrast, surface water DOM from northeastern Florida Bay featured a microbial-derived DOM signature based on the higher abundance of microbial humic-like and protein-like components consistent with its marine source. Surprisingly, groundwater DOM from northeastern Florida Bay reflected a terrestrial-derived source except for samples from central Florida Bay well, which mirrored a combination of terrestrial and marine end-member origin. Furthermore, surface water and groundwater displayed effects of different degradation pathways such as photodegradation and biodegradation as exemplified by two PARAFAC components seemingly indicative of such degradation processes. Finally, Principal Component Analysis of the EEM-PARAFAC data was able to distinguish and classify most of the samples according to DOM origins and degradation processes experienced, except for a small overlap of S332 surface water and groundwater, implying rather active surface-to-ground water interaction in some sites particularly during the rainy season. This study highlights that EEM-PARAFAC could be used successfully to trace and differentiate DOM from diverse sources across both horizontal and vertical flow profiles, and as such could be a convenient and useful tool for the better understanding of hydrological interactions and carbon biogeochemical cycling.

For the entire range of dissolved organic matters, the more hydrophobic fenbendazole and albendazole had higher sorption coefficients than thiabendazole and flubendazole, indicating that the traditional hypothesis of hydrophobic interaction holds for zwitterionic benzimidazole anthelmintics. However, the sorption coefficients of a given benzimidazole to selected dissolved organic matters (DOMs) varied within an order of magnitude. The measured Km values decreased in the order of fenbendazole, albendazole, thiabendazole and flubendazole for sewage sludge and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin whereas the orders were different for the other DOM surrogates, implying the hydrophilic nature of sewage sludge. This was also supported by the (N + O)/C elemental ratio of the sewage sludge sample used in this study. The correlations between log K(oc), and log K(ow) were weak (r(2) = 0.28-0.64) and the magnitude of the sorption coefficients to the hydrophilic organic matters (hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and sewage sludge) were similar to or slightly smaller than those for the hydrophobic organic matters (humic acids and liposome). This suggests that specific hydrophilic interactions also play a significant role in the sorption of moderately hydrophobic benzimidazoles to organic matters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of temperature and origin of dissolved organic matter on the partitioning behavior of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Background, aim, and scope The behavior of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is affected by dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in pore water of soils and sediments. Since partitioning to DOM reduces the bioavailable or freely dissolved PAH concentration in pore water, it is important to assess the effect of environmental variables on the magnitude of dissolved organic matter to water partition coefficients (K(DOC)). The objective of this study was to apply passive samplers to measure freely dissolved PAHs allowing depletion from the aqueous phase. The method was applied to determine K(DOC) at different temperatures for a selection of PAHs with natural DOM of very different origin. Materials and methods Freely dissolved concentrations of (spiked) phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[e] pyrene were determined by exposing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibers to aqueous solutions containing DOM extracted from freshwater sediments from Finland and the Netherlands. The K(DOC) values were subsequently calculated at different temperatures (3.2, 20, and 36 degrees C) by including temperature-dependent PDMS to water partition coefficients (K(PDMS)) in a mass balance. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on partitioning of PAHs to PDMS fibers or DOM was assessed by comparing the enthalpy of sorption to the excess enthalpy of dissolution of liquid PAHs. Results and discussion Partitioning to DOM resulted in a decrease of freely dissolved concentrations with increasing DOM concentrations and a large range in log K(DOC) values at 20 degrees C for benzo[e] pyrene was observed (log K(DOC) = 4.93-6.60 L kg(-1) organic carbon). An increase of 10 degrees C in temperature resulted in a decrease of K(PDMS) by 0.09 to 0.13 log units for phenanthrene to pyrene and a decrease of K(DOC) by 0.13 log units for pyrene. The calculated enthalpies of sorption were less exothermic than the (negative) excess enthalpies of dissolution as expected for non-specific interactions between PAHs and PDMS or DOM. Conclusions The bioavailability of PAHs in sedimentary pore waters can be accurately determined by application of PDMS fibers (without requiring negligible depletion) in the presence of natural DOM with different sorption affinity for PAHs. The observed natural variability in log K(DOC) values for different sediments shows that large differences can occur in freely dissolved PAH concentrations in pore water and properties of DOM should be taken into account in predicting the bioavailability of PAHs. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the partitioning behavior of PAHs shows that interactions between PAHs and environmental sorbents are comparable to interactions between PAHs in their pure condensed liquid phase and calculated excess enthalpies can be safely used to directly correct partition coefficients for temperature. Recommendations and perspectives The application of PDMS fibers in measuring freely dissolved PAH concentrations can be used to study structural and thermodynamic aspects of PAH sorption to natural DOM as well as other environmental processes such as enhanced diffusion phenomena in pore water that are dependent on the amount (or concentration) of DOM, sorption affinity of DOM, and hydrophobicity of PAHs. These environmental factors will therefore give further insight into the site-specific exposure to freely dissolved PAH concentrations in soil and sedimentary pore				Parsons, John/A-9528-2013	Parsons, John/0000-0003-1785-3627												0944-1344					JUN	2010	17	5					1070	1079		10.1007/s11356-009-0263-9						WOS:000279221700006	19953335

Spatial and temporal patterns in abundance and character of dissolved organic matter in two karst aquifers	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The spatial and temporal patterns in concentration and character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in karst basins in Slovenia and the United States were characterized. DOM in the shallow aquifer, or epikarst, waters was characterized by low, stable concentration and compounds of low aromaticity and humification. There was strong temporal coherence in DOM character, but not concentration, across locations within the epikarst. DOM in sinking streams, cave streams, and resurgence springs typically had higher DOM concentration and aromaticity. Fluorescence and parallel factor analysis of DOM revealed that humic or fulvic-like substances in soils, surface and cave streams, and springs were the dominant fluorophores. However, DOM extracted from soils was chemically different from that present in the stream and spring waters. Epikarst water contained humic-like and protein-like DOM, and had fluorescence characteristics indicative of microbial uptake and release of DOM in the epikarst. These data show that there are substantial basin-scale patterns in DOM concentration and character and that aquifer structure influences the spatial patterns of DOM in karst groundwater.																	1863-9135					JUN	2010	177	2					81	92		10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0177-0081						WOS:000283668300001

Dudley			Sources and seasonal patterns of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the hyporheic zone	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The hyporheic zone is a region underneath streambeds that integrates surface and groundwater. Although its location is central to biogeochemical linkages between the riparian zone, dissolved nutrients, and benthic biota, the seasonal quality and likely sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the hyporheic zone are not well understood. To investigate DOM characteristics in the hyporheic zone, water from the surface and subsurface (at depths 20, 60, and 100 cm below the streambed) was sampled every 4 weeks from 2007 to 2008 in a third-order stream in southern Ontario. Using UV spectroscopy, measures of spectral slopes, aromaticity, and A (254)/A (365) ratios (molecular weight) were obtained. Temporal changes in these measures were consistent with watershed processes such as shedding of leaf litter in the fall, and photochemical and biofilm influence in the spring and summer. The fluorescence index (a measure of relative DOM source) suggested that at the surface and in the downwelling zone, DOM microbial sources increased with depth in the sediment, regardless of the season. Excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) showed seasonally distinct, protein-like DOM components of bacterial origin that were stronger in the fall. Leachates from specific allochthonous DOM sources-leaf litter from Betula papyrifera (white birch) and Thuja occidentalis (white cedar)-and an autochthonous source, biofilm, were isolated and incubated with unfiltered surface water. EEMs from these leachates indicated that these sources could indeed help explain observed patterns of DOM in surface and subsurface waters. These results suggest that although DOM sources were relatively constant, biogeochemical processing within the hyporheic zone resulted a DOM pool that was temporally dynamic and altered the nature of organic matter transported downstream into lakes and rivers.																	0018-8158					JUN	2010	647	1					99	111		10.1007/s10750-009-9950-2						WOS:000277241700009

These spectra also contain information on whether the organic matter is produced in the water body or in its catchment. In this work various spectral indices, which are widely used in aquatic studies to determine humic substances, proteinaceous matter, chlorophyllous pigments and the origin (autochthonous versus allochthonous) of organic matter, were applied to track changes in a Holocene record from the large and shallow northern temperate Lake Peipsi (Estonia/Russia) at a high-resolution scale. Absorption and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the organic matter fraction dissolved in sediment pore water (pDOM) were analysed. In addition to the spectral measurements of pDOM, the sediment samples were analysed for main constituents (water and organic and mineral matter) and magnetic properties. The core chronology was established by nine radiocarbon datings. Temporal changes in pDOM in the record were quite variable; however, three periods in the development of the lake can be distinguished: a 2500 yr period in the early Holocene and a 2500 yr period in the late Holocene, when drastic changes in the accumulated matter occurred, and a rather stable 5000 yr period in between. We postulate that the changes over the period in the early Holocene reflect a rise of water level in the lake; the oscillations over the relatively steady period were probably caused by climatic factors, and alterations over the period in the late Holocene were due to the expansion of agricultural activity in the lake catchment. Our findings indicate that the use of spectral indices in palaeoinvestigations offers valuable information for reconstructing natural and human-induced developments of lakes.																	0018-8158					JUN	2010	646	1					21	31		10.1007/s10750-010-0174-2						WOS:000276660100003

New insights into the size distribution of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in estuarine waters	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The study of the fate and composition of organic matter in aquatic systems is of interest since organic matter is believed to play a key role in biogeochemical cycles. Fluorescent dissolved organic material (FDOM) represents a major fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) but is under explored, particularly in estuarine environments. In this study, 3D fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy was combined with tangential ultrafiltration (UF) to investigate the changes in FDOM properties during the mixing of fluvial and marine waters in two estuaries on the French Atlantic coast. Water samples were sequentially filtered through three membranes of decreasing molecular weight (MW) cut off points (3 kDa, 1 kDa and 500 Da). Four ultrafiltration fractions were obtained and were analysed using EEM spectroscopy, as well as for their DOC content. Satisfactory fluorescence and DOC mass balances were obtained after the sequential OF fractionation despite the variable DOC concentration and ionic strength of the estuarine samples, showing the reliability of the UF systems. DOC distribution in the different size classes was observed to vary between the upstream and downstream parts of the estuaries and to be different in the two estuaries. The value of combining UF and EEM spectroscopy was shown, since the coupling allowed observation and isolation of some fluorophores which could not be distinguished in the spectra of bulk samples. Thus, the beta fluorophore, observed mainly in marine samples until now, and which is associated with material of autochthonous biological origin, was present in the lowest size fraction (MW < 500 Da) from all water samples, including freshwater ones. The gamma fluorophore, characteristic of protein-like compounds, was observed in the small size fractions of some fresh and brackish water samples, but it was not visible in the spectra of the corresponding bulk water samples. The differences in fluorescence properties of the size fractions of DOM were further evaluated by determining three fluorescence indices: the fluorescence index (f(450)/f(500)), the humification index (HIX) and the index of recent autochthonous contribution (BIX). The origin and degree of transformation of DOM can be assessed through the calculation of these indices. We showed that the most humified OM was associated with different size fractions, depending on water sample origin, and was characterised by intermediate MW (higher for fresh than marine water). We also showed that DOM distribution and characteristics differ between the Gironde and Seine estuaries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, DOM was extracted with either water or a saline solution from the various horizons of four different soil profiles, either cultivated or not, and characterized by chemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques such as emission fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Water and a saline solution extracted different amounts of DOM. These results imply that the effect of colloidal dispersion exerted by water resulted in a higher release and solubilization of organic matter compared with colloidal flocculation exerted by the saline solution. Thus, the extractant used for DOM extraction from soil must be taken into due account for its effect on the nature of DOM extracted. Our results corroborate the need to standardize extraction methods. Fluorescence emission spectra provided evidence of a variation in DOM composition as a function of depth along the soil profile, which was possibly related to adsorption of aromatic molecules on soil colloids. Finally, land use also seemed to influence the chemical nature of DOM along the soil profile.

Singlet Oxygen in the Coupled Photochemical and Biochemical Oxidation of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a significant (>700 Pg) global C pool. Transport of terrestrial DOM to the inland waters and coastal zones represents the largest flux of reduced C from land to water (215 Tg yr-(1)) (Meybeck, M. Am. J. Sci. 1983, 282, 401-450). Oxidation of DOM by interdependent photochemical and biochemical processes largely controls the fate of DOM entering surface waters. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been hypothesized to play a significant role in the photooxidation of DOM, because they may oxidize the fraction of DOM that is inaccessible to direct photochemical degradation by sunlight. We followed the effects of photochemically produced singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) on DOM by mass spectrometry with (18)O-labeled oxygen, to understand how (1)O(2)-mediated transformations of DOM may lead to altered DOM bioavailability. The photochemical oxygen uptake by DOM attributed to (1)O(2) increased with DOM concentration, yet it remained a minority contributor to photochemical oxygen uptake even at very high DOM concentrations. When DOM samples were exposed to (1)O(2)-generating conditions (Rose Bengal and visible light), increases were observed in DOM constituents with higher oxygen content and release of H(2)O(2) was detected. Differential effects of H(2)O(2) and (1)O(2)-treated DOM showed that (1)O(2)-treated DOM led to slower bacterial growth rates relative				Amado, Andre/A-9906-2008; McNeill, Kristopher/A-9834-2009; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016; 	Amado, Andre/0000-0002-7736-8802; McNeill, Kristopher/0000-0002-2981-2227; Cory, Rose/0000-0001-9867-7084												0013-936X					MAY 15	2010	44	10					3683	3689		10.1021/es902989y						WOS:000277499500009	20408544	
J	Chen, GA; Lin, C; Chen, LA; Yang, H				Chen, Guang; Lin, Chao; Chen, Liang; Yang, Hong			Effect of size-fractionation dissolved organic matter on the mobility of prometryne in soil	CHEMOSPHERE												Import of organic materials in the form of compost, sludge or plant residues introduces large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into soils. DOM as a dynamic soil component affects the behaviors of organic pollutants. Different DOM constituents may affect herbicide action in a different way. However, the process of interaction between the distinct DOM-fractions and herbicides is largely unknown. In this study, DOM was separated by size-fractionation into three molecular size groups: MW < 3500 Da, 3500 Da < MW < 14 000 Da, and MW > 14 000 Da. Effects of DOM-fractions on prometryne sorption/desorption and mobility were analyzed using approaches of batch experiments, soil column and soil thin-layer chromatography. Application of varied DOM-fractions at 50 mg DOC L(-1) to the soil reduced the sorption and increased desorption of prometryne. DOM-fraction with MW > 14 000 Da appeared most effective in prometryne mobilization in the soil than any other fractions. Finally, DOM-fractions were characterized by chemical analyses, fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) fluorescence spectroscopy. Our studies revealed that the high-molecular weight fraction contained more aromatic framework and unsaturated structure that was most likely the dominant factor modulating the behavior of prometryne in soils.

Soils amended with sewage sludge and sludge compost display different physicochemical properties, especially in terms of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition that affects the electron-donating capacity (EDC) of DOM in soils. The aim of this paper was to compare the EDC of DOM derived from sewage sludge and sludge compost for enhancing Fe(III) bioreduction. It is expected that this research could be helpful for further understanding of soil remediation in the future. Sludge and compost DOM were extracted from sewage sludge and sludge compost, respectively. Fractionation, CHNO/S analysis, Fourier-transform infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry were then used to determine the degree of aromaticity and humification in the samples. To determine if their EDC was altered during composting, samples were reduced by the humic-reducing bacterium, Shewanella cinica D14(T), after which their EDC values were determined. The initial and potential EDC values of the samples were measured using FeCl(3)/Fe(citrate) as an electron acceptor. The insoluble Fe(III) oxide reduction by strain D14(T) was mediated by DOM. Both sludge and compost DOM contained redox-active functional groups that could shuttle electrons to insoluble Fe(III) oxide and accelerate Fe(III) bioreduction. When FeCl(3) was used as an oxidizing agent, their potential EDC reached 0.25 and 0.50 meq/(mg C), respectively. In addition, their electron transfer ability could be recycled. The degree of humification of DOM increased during sludge composting, which resulted in the EDC of compost DOM being greater than that of sludge DOM. Furthermore, the rate of Fe(III) bioreduction mediated by DOM could be accelerated under anaerobic conditions, which has important implications for soil biogeochemistry because it may accelerate the rate of some kinds of toxic metals and recalcitrant organic pollutants transformation or degradation.

Unraveling the role of land use and microbial activity in shaping dissolved organic matter characteristics in stream ecosystems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Surface water samples were collected from 43 streams distributed throughout watersheds of mixed land use in southern Ontario, Canada. Absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM characteristics were related to environmental variables, microbial activity indicators (bacterial production and extracellular leucine aminopeptidase activity), and riparian land use to understand better how these factors influence DOM in streams. PARAFAC produced a six-component model (C1 to C6). Temperature correlated with each PARAFAC component, suggesting that water source, drainage area, and light penetration broadly affected DOM characteristics. C1 and C2 represented terrestrial, humic-like DOM fluorophore groups and comprised 41-65% of stream DOM fluorescence. C5, a tryptophan-like component, related negatively to a humification index but positively to leucine-aminopeptidase activity and recently produced DOM, suggesting that C5 consisted of autochthonous, microbially produced DOM. C3, C4, and C6 showed signs of quinone-like, humic-like, and microbial transformable fluorophores. The distribution of these potentially redox-active PARAFAC components indicated that DOM was in a more reduced state in streams with higher bacterial production and agricultural land use than in streams with increased wetlands area, which had greater relative abundance of the oxidized quinone-like component. Anthropogenic land use and microbial activity altered the quantity and quality of DOM exported from human-affected streams from that observed in forest-and wetland-dominated streams. DOM in agriculturally affected streams was likely more labile and accessible to the microbial community than DOM in wetland streams, which supported low rates of microbial activity.

Meridional variability in dissolved organic matter stocks and diagenetic state within the euphotic and mesopelagic zone of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), bulk carbohydrates (TCHO), and dissolved combined neutral sugars (DCNS) were measured during a meridional U.S. CO(2) - Climate Variability (CLIVAR) Repeat Hydrography Project cruise (A20) from 7-43 degrees N in the North Atlantic. Maxima in DOC, TCHO, and DCNS concentrations and carbohydrate yields (TCHO and DCNS as a % of DOC) were observed within the most stratified surface waters south of 27 degrees N. Concentrations and yields of TCHO and DCNS decreased to the north and south of their respective maxima, indicating significant variability in the apparent diagenetic state of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the transect. Changes in apparent diagenetic state to the north appeared to be largely related to the previous entrainment of recalcitrant DOM during deep winter/spring convective mixing. Deep mixing was less of a factor in the more stratified waters to the south where the decrease in carbohydrate yields indicated diagenetic alteration of the surface-accumulated pool of DOM. Overall, diagenesis decreased both carbohydrate yields and the mol% of galactose and mannose + xylose content and in deep waters resulted in a significant enrichment in the mol% of glucose. TCHO yields and the mol% of glucose revealed significant differences in DOM quality between subtropical mode water (STMW) and upper Antarctic Intermediate Water (uAAIW) that were related to the extent of water mass ventilation.

J	Lonborg, C; Alvarez-Salgado, XA; Davidson, K; Martinez-Garcia, S; Teira, E				Lonborg, Christian; Alvarez-Salgado, Xose A.; Davidson, Keith; Martinez-Garcia, Sandra; Teira, Eva			Assessing the microbial bioavailability and degradation rate constants of dissolved organic matter by fluorescence spectroscopy in the coastal upwelling system of the Ria de Vigo	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The time course of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption and fluorescence were monitored during 50 to 70 days of laboratory incubations with water collected in the coastal upwelling system of the Ria de Vigo (NW Iberian Peninsula) under contrasting hydrographic conditions. CDOM fluorescence at peak-T (Ex/Em, 280/350 nm), characteristic of protein-like materials, decayed at a 1st order degradation rate constant (k(T)) of 0.28 +/- 0.13 day(-1) (average +/- SD). k(T) covaried (R(2) = 0.86, p<0.0002) with the degradation rate of the bulk DOC (k(DOC)), but the protein-like materials degraded 72 +/- 23% faster than DOC. Therefore, this study confirms that the CDOM fluorescence at peak-T can be used as a proxy to a DOM fraction significantly more labile than the bulk bioavailable DOC. In parallel with the decay of DOC and protein-like fluorescence, an increase in CDOM fluorescence at peak-M (Ex/Em, 320/410 nm) during the course of the incubations verified the production of marine humic-like substances as a by-product of the microbial metabolism. CDOM fluorescence at peak-M built-up at a production rate (k(M)) of 0.06 +/- 0.01 day(-1) (average SD) in the Ria de Vigo. Furthermore, the slope of the linear regression between k(DOC) and k(M) (R(2) = 0.64, p<0.001) revealed that the formation of marine humic-like substances occurred at about one fifth of the rate of net DOC consumption.

Christopher; Zepp, Richard G.; Vahatalo, Anssi; Lee, Rosalynn; Bartels, Erich			Photobleaching kinetics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter derived from mangrove leaf litter and floating Sargassum colonies	MARINE CHEMISTRY												We examined the photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) derived from Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) leaf litter and floating Sargassum colonies as these marine plants can be important contributors to coastal and open ocean CDOM pools, respectively. Mangrove and Sargassum CDOM readily degraded when exposed to simulated solar irradiance (CPS SunTest solar simulator exposures). CDOM produced from brown mangrove leaves (representative of substantial senescence) exhibited shorter photobleaching half-lives (a(305) t(1/2)<50 h) than CDOM produced from yellow and orange (early and mid senescence) leaves (a(305) t(1/2)similar to 60-90 h). Mangrove CDOM photobleaching rates were higher in the mid-UVA (a(350)) than in the UVB (a(305)) spectral region. Photobleaching half-lives of Sargassum CDOM were mostly <40 hand more consistent across UVB (a(305)) and UVA (a(350)) wavelengths. Sargassum CDOM photomineralized during simulated solar irradiation producing DIC at rates exceeding 2500 nmol m l(-1) h(-1), indicating that regions of the surface ocean with large concentrations of this plant may provide a strong CO(2) source to the atmosphere. Sargassum CDOM photoreactions also produced CO more efficiently than terrestrial CDOM and much more efficiently than ambient CDOM in the open ocean. Thus, biological production of CDOM may be the rate-limiting step for photoproduction of DIC from Sargassum and other sources in the open ocean. An examination of CDOM photobleaching in Florida Keys coastal waters indicates that one month of summertime solar radiation may substantially increase UVB and UVA exposure to corals in shallow waters (<4 m), especially along the offshore reef tract. But, our results also indicate that when ambient CDOM levels are high, the corals are well-buffered against increases in ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) exposure even after periods of extended CDOM photobleaching.

J	Shank, GC; Lee, R; Vahatalo, A; Zepp, RG; Bartels, E				Shank, G. Christopher; Lee, Rosalynn; Vahatalo, Anssi; Zepp, Richard G.; Bartels, Erich			Production of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from mangrove leaf litter and floating Sargassum colonies	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) strongly absorbs solar radiation in the blue-green and serves as the primary attenuator of water column ultraviolet radiation (UV-R). CDOM interferes with remote sensing of ocean chlorophyll and can control UV-R-induced damage to light-sensitive organisms including corals. We used laboratory incubations to evaluate CDOM production from senescing Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) leaf litter (yellow, orange, and brown) and floating Sargassum colonies. Mangroves exist at the land-ocean interface near coral reefs in sub-tropical and tropical regions while floating Sargassum colonies tend to congregate in sub-tropical ocean gyres. CDOM production (similar to 48 h) from mangrove leaves collected during a dry period in June 2004 (0.17 +/- 0.11 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) was lower than production from leaves collected during a wet period in September 2003 (0.57 +/- 0.42 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) suggesting that CDOM production from leaf litter fluctuates in response to environmental factors. CDOM production was greatest for the mid-senescence orange leaves and lowest for the severely senesced brown leaves in both experiments. Along the sub-tropical Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem, the primary source of CDOM is discharge from the shallow seagrass-dominated Florida Bay as evidenced by a strong correlation between field CDOM measurements and previously reported Florida Bay discharge volumes. However, field observations provide evidence that large expanses of red mangroves throughout the Keys could be important CDOM sources to the region's coral reefs during periods of reduced Florida Bay discharge. Floating Sargassum colonies also readily produced CDOM in laboratory incubations, but at much more variable rates than mangrove leaves. However, our calculations indicate that large mats of floating Sargassum could provide important CDOM quantities to oligotrophic oceanic waters including the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic.

J	Gao, L; Fan, DD; Li, DJ; Cai, JG				Gao, Lei; Fan, Daidu; Li, Daoji; Cai, Jingong			Fluorescence characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in shallow water along the Zhejiang coasts, southeast China	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Twenty-eight surface water samples from rivers, muddy intertidal flats, sand shores, and bedrock coasts were collected along the Zhejiang coastline in southeast China. In addition, three samples from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) were collected for comparison. CDOM (chromophoric dissolved organic matter) absorption and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, as well as nutrients and DOC were measured in these samples. According to salinity, nutrient, and DOC constituents, the 28 Zhejiang samples were categorized into four groups, i.e. highly-polluted, river derived, muddy-flat derived, and saltwater dominated ones. Among the six parameters (two humic-like and two protein-like peak intensities in fluorescence EEM contours, absorption at 300 nm, and DOC concentration) for the Zhejiang samples, any two of them were positively correlated. The submarine groundwater discharge, rather than local rivers, might have provided most of the freshwater that interacted with the saltwater during the mixing process. The high protein-like EEM peaks in samples from muddy salt marshes and rivers were probably caused by terrestrial inputs, land-based pollution, and local biological activities in combination.

J	Apell, JN; Boyer, TH				Apell, Jennifer N.; Boyer, Treavor H.			Combined ion exchange treatment for removal of dissolved organic matter and hardness	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and hardness cations are two common constituents of natural waters that substantially impact water treatment processes. Anion exchange treatment, and in particular magnetic ion exchange (MIEX), has been shown to effectively remove DOM from natural waters. An important advantage of the MIEX process is that it is used as a slurry in a completely mixed flow reactor at the beginning of the treatment train. Hardness ions can be removed with cation exchange resins, although typically using a fixed bed reactor at the end of a treatment train. In this research, the feasibility of combining anion and cation exchange treatment in a single completely mixed reactor for treatment of raw water was investigated. The sequence of anion and cation exchange treatment, the number of regeneration cycles, and the chemistry of the regeneration solution were systematically explored. Simultaneous removal of DOM (70% as dissolved organic carbon) and hardness (>55% as total hardness) was achieved by combined ion exchange treatment. Combined ion exchange is expected to be useful as a pre-treatment for membrane systems because both DOM and divalent cations are major foulants of membranes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of seasonal changes in fluorescent dissolved organic matter among aquatic lake and stream sites in the Green Lakes Valley	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The spectral characteristics of whole water dissolved organic matter (DOM) and fulvic acid were studied in samples collected from an alpine lake, a subalpine lake, and a subalpine stream during snowmelt and the summer growing season. Excitation-emission matrices of whole water DOM and fulvic acid were analyzed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Allochthonous inputs of terrestrially derived fulvic acid DOM were dominant during snowmelt at the alpine lake, and during both snowmelt and summer at the subalpine sites. At the alpine lake, autochthonous inputs of DOM dominated during the summer phytoplankton bloom, and the spectral characteristics of the whole water DOM diverged from those of the fulvic acid. For example, the quinone-like fluorophores in whole water DOM at the alpine lake were more oxidized and microbially derived than the fulvic acid fraction during the summer. At the subalpine sites, the seasonal changes in the source and redox state of the quinone-like fluorophores of the whole water DOM tracked those of the fulvic acid pool. However, at both lake sites there was a greater contribution of amino acid-like fluorophores in the whole water DOM than the fulvic acid fraction. This trend was not observed at the subalpine stream site. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the PARAFAC components suggests that during snowmelt, the chemical quality of the DOM at the alpine lake was similar to that of the subalpine stream; whereas the alpine site was more similar to the subalpine lake during the summer. Spectral characterization and PCA of the PARAFAC components suggest that nonhumic quinone-like and amino acid-like fluorophores were produced in the alpine lake during the summer phytoplankton bloom. Our results show that different types of water bodies produce different seasonal patterns in whole water DOM and fulvic acid quantity and quality.

J	Stedmon, CA; Osburn, CL; Kragh, T				Stedmon, Colin A.; Osburn, Christopher L.; Kragh, Theis			Tracing water mass mixing in the Baltic-North Sea transition zone using the optical properties of coloured dissolved organic matter	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The distribution and characteristics of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Baltic - North Sea transition zone were studied. The aim was to assess the validity of predicting CDOM absorption in the region on the basis of water mass mixing alone and demonstrate the utility of CDOM as an indicator of water mass mixing in coastal seas. A three-end-member mixing model representing the three major allochthonous CDOM sources was sufficient to describe the patterns in CDOM absorption distribution observed. The three-end-member water masses were the: Baltic outflow, German Bight and the central North Sea. Previously, it was thought that water from the German Bight transported northwards in the Jutland coastal current only sporadically influenced mixing between the Baltic and North Sea. The results from this study show that water from the German Bight is detectable at salinities down to 12 in the Kattegat and Belt Sea. On average, 23% of the CDOM in bottom waters of the Kattegat, Great Belt, Belt Sea, Arkona Sea and the Sound originated from the German Bight. Using this conservative mixing model approach, local CDOM inputs were detectable but found to be limited, representing only 0.25% of CDOM in the surface waters of the Kattegat and Belt Sea. The conservative mixing of CDOM makes it possible to predict its distribution and characteristics and offers a powerful tool for tracing water mass mixing in the region. The results also emphasize the need to include the Jutland Coastal current in hydrodynamic models for the region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abiotic interactions of natural dissolved organic matter and carbonate aquifer rock	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Abiotic interactions between natural dissolved organic matter (NDOM) and carbonate aquifer rock may be controlling factors of biogeochemical processes and contaminant fate in carbonate aquifer systems The importance and effects of these interactions were examined using batch adsorption experiments of soil NDOM and representative carbonate sorbents from the Floridan Aquifer Adsorption of NDOM carbon to aquifer rocks was well-described using a modified linear model and was mostly reversible Significant adsorption was observed at higher NDOM concentrations, while the release of indigenous organic matter from the rocks occurred at lower concentrations. Longer interaction periods led to more adsorption, indicating that adsorption equilibrium was not achieved For relatively pure carbonate rock samples. sorbent surface area was found to be the most important controlling factor of adsorption, whereas the presence of indigenous organic matter and subdominant mineral phases were more important, when they occurred Preferential adsorption of a high over low molecular weight and humic over fulvic components of NDOM onto carbonate sorbents was detected using liquid size exclusion chromatography and excitation-emission fluorometry, respectively. The presence of NDOM inhibited mineral dissolution, though this inhibition was not proportional to NDOM concentration as surface area and mineralogy of carbonate sorbents played additional roles Though the NDOM-carbonate rock adsorption mechanism Could not be completely determined due to the heterogeneity and complexity of NDOM and sorbent surfaces, it is speculated that both rapid and weak outer-sphere bonding and stronger but slower hydrophobic interaction occur These results have important implications for groundwater quality and hydrogeologic projects such as aquifer storage and recovery (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

Conformational Distribution of Dissolved Organic Matter Released from Compost by Repeated Water Extractions	COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION												The dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from compost by repeated water extractions was quantified and DOM conformational changes by high performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) were followed. Three commercial composts were extracted consecutively 4 times with equal water: compost ratios. The total organic carbon content of each DOM sample was analyzed using the chemical oxygen demand method, and the conformational size-distribution assessed by means of HPSEC. Results showed that compost continues to release considerable amounts of DOM with repeated water extractions, and that subsequent DOM extractions resulted in organic matter with increasing molecular dimensions and presumably larger hydrophobicity. This may have important consequences on soil processes and functions such as organic matter dynamics and transport of pollutants.

While it has brought great benefits to crop production, it has also resulted in contamination to ecosystem In this study, we investigated accumulation of chlorotoluron (Chl) and biological responses of wheat plants as affected by dissolved organic matter (DOM) Wheat seedlings grown tinder 10 mg kg(-1) Chl for 4 d showed a low level of chlorophyll accumulation and damage to plasma membrane. The growth was inhibited by exposure of chlorotoluron. Treatment with 50 mg DOC kg(-1) DOM derived either from sludge (DOM-SL) or straw (DOM-ST) attenuated the chlorotoluron toxicity to plants Both DOMs decreased activities of catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in Chl-treated seedlings. However, an increased glutathione S-transferases activity was observed under the same condition. Wheat plants treated with Chl in the presence of DOM accumulated less Chl than those treated with Chl alone Moreover, in the presence of DOM, bioconcentration factor (BCF) decreased whereas translocation factors increased Analyses with FT-IR spectra confirmed the regulatory role of DOMs in reducing Chl accumulation in wheat (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In a laboratory flume experiment the concave shape of DOC profiles observed in the upper 10 cm of Gulf of Mexico sublittoral sands was reproduced by the combination of DOC filtration and production in the sediment surface layer and mineralization and adsorption in the subsurface layer. Six percent to 14% of (13)C-labeled, highly degradable DOC was mineralized during filtration through 5.8-cm-long sand-filled column reactors, up to nine times more than in dark, water-filled column reactors. Filtration through 50-cm-long sand columns removed all highly degradable DOC pumped through the sediment, translating to fluxes of up to 379 mmol DOC m(-2) d(-1), corresponding to DOC removal from an approximately 1-m-deep water layer each day. Bacterial incorporation of (13)C identified a diverse group of sedimentary aerobic and anaerobic microbes processing DO(13)C filtered through sand columns, dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. Excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy analysis of chromophoric dissolved organic matter contained in diatom-derived DOC indicated that microbes preferentially removed components around the fluorescence peak of tryptophan or protein-like substances, which may have the highest nutrient value. Mass spectra analysis revealed that filtration through sand also removes a broad spectrum of substances from less degradable humic and fulvic acid-like DOC and produces new DOC components. The flushed sand layer between the water column and deeper anoxic sediment layers acts as an effective DOC filter, with subsurface horizontal pore-water flows promoting decomposition of DOC.

Hyporheic zone porewaters were sampled at different depths of 10, 30, 50, 70 cm at two study sites with different sediment material. The results showed significant differences in DOC concentrations between the upper and lower stream HZ. The current results indicate that small lowland sediments provide both a source and a sink of DOC for stream water, depending on the river course. The higher DOC level observed in the hyporheic zone suggests that porewater can be an autonomic site of biogeochemical changes of dissolved organic matter, which is very clear in the SUVA fluctuations.

Many of the sites have a limited allochthonous supply of organic matter (OM) and contain ecosystems that are dependent on chemolithoautotrophic microbial communities. Water-extracted OM from microbial mats at the sites had fluorescence signatures consistent with the fluorescent amino acids. Based on fluorescence-derived indices and absorbance spectral characteristics, the origin of the cave and spring CDOM appeared to be from microbially-derived material, and the degree of OM humification was low. Little of the CDOM pool was represented by terrestrial humic fluorescence signatures, which are typically observed in surface waters, as well as soil and sediment porewaters. Comparison of the cave and spring waters with a wide array of reference humic substances and OM from other environments showed a continuum of spectral properties constrained by origin and degree of humification.

Comprehensive characterization of marine dissolved organic matter by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with electrospray and atmospheric pressure photoionization	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY												We compare the ultrahigh resolution 9.4T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectra of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from two sites in the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) obtained by complementary electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI). Ions produced by APPI extend to higher carbon unsaturation than those produced by ESI, indicated by higher double-bond equivalents (rings plus double bonds) minus oxygen (DBE-O) values, whereas ESI-generated ions are more oxygenated. Moreover, many sulfur-containing compounds were efficiently ionized by ESI but not detected by APPI. Because the mass spectra obtained by ESI and APPI are significantly different, both are necessary to obtain a more complete description of the molecular composition of marine DOM.

Distribution and photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Antarctic Peninsula (Southern Ocean)	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) plays a key role regulating light attenuation in the ocean. This optically reactive pool of organic matter is driven by several physical and biological processes such as photobleaching, photohumification, and biogeneration, that act as primary sinks and sources of CDOM. In this study. we described the geographical and vertical distribution of CDOM in the Antarctic Peninsula area (Southern Ocean), and assessed its potential driving factors, with special emphasis on CDOM photo reactivity. CDOM values were between the detection limit and 2.17 m(-1) at 325 nm and between the detection limit and 0.76 m(-1) at 443 nm (average a(325) = 0.36 +/- 0.02 m(-1), average a(443) = 0-11 +/- 0.01 m(-1)). with the highest values inside Deception Island in 2004, and the lowest in the Eastern Bransfield Strait. In Bellingshausen Sea, CDOM was higher below the mixed layer suggesting a significant role of photobleaching. By contrast in the Weddell Sea maximum values were found within the mixed layer. In the Weddell Sea, a positive correlation between CDOM and both chlorophyll a and bacterial production and a negative correlation with salinity suggest a biological source of CDOM likely associated to ice melting. Salinity was also negatively related to the spectral slopes from 275 to 295 nm, considered a good proxy for DOM molecular weight. The experimental results demonstrate the photoreactive nature of CDOM, with half lives from 2.1 to 5.1 days due to photobleaching in the upper layer and duplication times from 4.9 to 15.7 days due to photohumification, that highlight the highly dynamic nature of CDOM in this area.

Uncertainty Analysis of the Nonideal Competitive Adsorption-Donnan Model: Effects of Dissolved Organic Matter Variability on Predicted Metal Speciation in Soil Solution	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Ion binding models such as the nonideal competitive adsorption-Donnan model (NICA-Donnan) and model VI successfully describe laboratory data of proton and metal binding to purified humic substances (HS). In this study model performance was tested in more complex natural systems. The speciation predicted with the NICA-Donnan model and the associated uncertainty were compared with independent measurements in soil solution extracts, including the free metal ion activity and fulvic (FA) and humic acid (HA) fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Potentially important sources of uncertainty are the DOM composition and the variation in binding properties of HS. HS fractions of DOM in soil solution extracts varied between 14 and 63% and consisted mainly of FA. Moreover, binding parameters optimized for individual FA samples show substantial variation. Monte Carlo simulations show that uncertainties in predicted metal speciation, for metals with a high affinity for FA (Cu, Pb), are largely due to the natural variation in binding properties (i.e., the affinity) of FA. Predictions for metals with a lower affinity (Cd) are more prone to uncertainties in the fraction FA in DOM and the maximum site density (i.e., the capacity) of the FA. Based on these findings, suggestions are provided to reduce uncertainties in model predictions.

Tracing global biogeochemical cycles and meridional overturning circulation using chromophoric dissolved organic matter	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Basin-scale distributions of light absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are positively correlated (R(2) > 0.8) with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) within the top kilometer of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, a much weaker correspondence is found for the Atlantic (R(2) < 0.05). Strong correlation between CDOM and AOU indicates that CDOM is created as a byproduct of the oxidation of organic matter from sinking particles. The observed meridional-depth sections of CDOM result from a balance between biogeochemical processes (autochthonous production and solar bleaching) and the meridional overturning circulation. Rapid mixing in the Atlantic dilutes CDOM in the interior and implies that the time scale for CDOM accumulation is greater than similar to 50 years. CDOM emerges as a unique tracer for diagnosing changes in biogeochemistry and the overturning circulation, similar to dissolved oxygen, with the additional feature that it can be quantified from satellite observation.

Scott			A COMPARISON OF THE COPPER SENSITIVITY OF SIX INVERTEBRATE SPECIES IN AMBIENT SALT WATER OF VARYING DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER CONCENTRATIONS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The copper sensitivity of four saltwater invertebrates (the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, the oyster Crassostrea virginica, the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus, and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) was determined experimentally using chronic-estimator embryo-larval test procedures. The effect of sample dissolved organic matter (DOM) content on Cu bioavailability was determined for these species using commonly prescribed test procedures. Comparisons were made among these test results and test results reported previously for two other invertebrate species: the mussel Mytilus edulis and the copepod Eurytemora affinis. All six species exhibited a direct and significant relationship between the sample dissolved organic carbon (DOC; a Surrogate measure of DOM) and either the dissolved Cu median lethal concentration (LC50) values or median effect concentration (EC50) values. This relationship is significant even when the DOM has different quality as evidenced by molecular fluorescence spectroscopy. Once normalized for the effects of DOM, the Cu sensitivity of these species front least to most sensitive were E. affinis < D. excitricus < C. virginica approximate to S. purpuratus approximate to M. edulis, approximate to M. galloprovincialis. This ranking of species sensitivity differs from the saltwater species sensitivity distribution proposed in 2003 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. These results support the need to account for factors that modify Cu bioavailability in future saltwater Cu criteria development efforts. More specifically, Cu saltwater species sensitivity distribution data will need to be normalized by factors affecting Cu bioavailability to assure that accurate and protective criteria are subsequently developed for saltwater species and their uses.

Production of dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients by gelatinous zooplankton in the York River estuary, Chesapeake Bay	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Large "blooms" of ctenophores (Mnemiopsis leidyi) and scyphomedusae (Chrysaora quinquecirrha) occur throughout the York River, a sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay. These gelatinous zooplankton blooms can influence carbon (C) and nutrient cycling through excretion of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). We measured dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (DOC, DON and DOP), ammonium (NH(4)(+)) and phosphate (PO(4)(3-)) released by M. leidyi and C. quinquecirrha in the laboratory, and estimated their contribution to in situ DOC and inorganic pools. Both species released high amounts of DOC compared with DON and DOP. DOM released by Mnemiopsis was C-rich with higher DOC:DON (29:1) compared with the Redfield ratio (6.6C:1N). Daily turnover of DOC and DON in ctenophores was high (25.2% of body C and 18.3% of body N), likely due to mucus production. In contrast, individual Chrysaora released DOC and DON similar to Redfield stoichiometry, but daily turnover of these compounds was low (< 3% of body C and N). Both species released dissolved N and P in inorganic form but also released sizeable quantities of DON (21 and 35% of total dissolved nitrogen, TDN, for ctenophores and medusae, respectively) and DOP (34 and 46% of TDP). Most of the DOC in the York River came from Mnemiopsis populations during summer (May-July). While their contribution to bulk DOC pools was low (< 1% day(-1)), ctenophore populations released higher amounts of DOC to labile pools (18-29% day(-1)). Contributions to NH(4)(+) and PO(4)(3-) pools were highest at times when the York River was N-limited (5.8N:1P). Despite their potential to release phytoplankton from nutrient limitation, N excretion from gelatinous zooplankton supported < 4% of primary production. Because net NH(4)(+) released by Mnemiopsis populations exceeded standing concentrations, we hypothesize an alternative DIN sink whereby bacterioplankton supplement uptake of DOM released by gelatinous zooplankton with inorganic N and P to satisfy intracellular elemental requirements.																	0142-7873					FEB	2010	32	2					153	170		10.1093/plankt/fbp109						WOS:000273230300004

In the present study, fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from three different ages of land-fill leachate (1a, 5a, 10a) under different pH value were investigated. The fluorescence synchronous scan spectroscopy showed that, in addition to the characteristic each age of landfill leachate owned separately, DOM from three ages of landfill leachate shared some common characteristics with the change in pH as follows: the fluorescence peaks of DOM exhibited in synchronous scan spectroscopy from 1 and 5-year-old leachate showed the maximum fluorescence intensity at pH 5, while that of DOM from 10-year-old landfill leachate appeared at pH 12, and the fluorescence intensity of most fluorescence peaks of DOM from 10-year-old landfill leachate exhibited in synchronous scan spectroscopy at pH 4 ranked second. The three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (3DEEM) suggested that the fluorescence intensity of the protein-like peaks of DOM from all three ages of landfill leachate increased with pH value increasing, and the maximum fluorescence occurred at pH 10, while that of DOM from 10-year-old appeared at pH 8; the fluorescence intensity of the visible fulvic-like peaks of DOM from all three ages of landfill leachate was enhanced with pH increasing, and exhibited the maximum fluorescence intensity at pH 10, while the relation curve between the fluorescence intensity of the UV fulvic-like and pH value of DOM from all three year ages of landfill leachate exhibited two peaks, one occurred at pH 4, and the other appeared at pH 10. 3 DEEM also indicated that compared to the fluvic-like matter, the protein-like matter was more easily influenced by pH value. The relation between the r((A.C)) value and pH value suggested that the former relied on the latter. If we would compare the r((A.C)) values of DOM originating differently, the authors should compare each other under the same pH value.																	1000-0593					FEB	2010	30	2					382	386		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)02-0382-05						WOS:000274321800022		
J	Maoz, A; Chefetz, B				Maoz, Adi; Chefetz, Benny			Sorption of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and naproxen to dissolved organic matter: Role of structural fractions	WATER RESEARCH												Pharmaceutical compounds and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are co-introduced into the environment by irrigation with reclaimed wastewater and/or application of biosolids. In this study, we evaluate the role and mechanism of interaction of the pharmaceuticals naproxen and carbamazepine with structural fractions of biosolids-derived DOM. Sorption interactions were estimated from dialysis-bag experiments at different pHs. Sorption of naproxen and carbamazepine by the hydrophobic acid fraction exhibited strong pH-dependence. With both pharmaceuticals, the highest sorption coefficients (K(DOC)) were at pH 4. With the hydrophobic neutral fraction, pH affected only naproxen sorption (decreasing with increasing pH). Among the hydrophilic DOM fractions, the hydrophilic acid fraction exhibited the highest K(DOC) value for carbamazepine, probably due to their bipolar character. In the hydrophilic acid fraction-naproxen system, significant anionic repulsion was observed with increasing pH. The hydrophilic base fraction contains positively charged functional groups. Therefore with increasing ionization of naproxen (with increasing pH), K(DOC) to this fraction increased. The hydrophilic neutral fraction exhibited the lowest K(DOC) with both studied pharmaceuticals. The K(DOC) value of carbamazepine with the bulk DOM sample was higher than the calculated K(DOC) value based on sorption by the individual isolated fractions. The opposite trend was observed with naproxen at pH 8: the calculated K(DOC) value was higher than the value obtained for the bulk DOM. These results demonstrate that DOM fractions interact with each other and do not act as separate sorption domains. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the role of colloids in the transport of viruses in groundwater, experiments were conducted using a 2 m long column packed with heterogeneous gravel aquifer media. Bacteriophage MS2 was used as the model virus and kaolinite as the model colloid. Experimental data were analyzed using Temporal Moment Analysis and Filtration Theory. In the absence of kaolinite colloid, MS2 phage traveled slightly faster than the conservative tracer bromide (Br), with little differences observed between unfiltered and filtered MS2 phage (0.22 mu m. as the operational cut-off for colloid-free virus). In the presence of kaolinite colloids, MS2 phage breakthrough occurred concurrently with that of the colloidal particles and the time taken to reach the peak virus concentration was reduced, suggesting a colloid-facilitated virus transport in terms of peak-concentration time and velocity. Meanwhile mass recovery and magnitude of concentrations of the phages were significantly reduced, indicating colloid-assisted virus attenuation in terms of concentrations and mass. Decreasing the pH or increasing the ionic strength increased the level of virus attachment to the aquifer media and colloids, and virus transport became more retarded, resulting in lower peak-concentration, lower mass recovery, longer peak-concentration time, and greater apparent collision efficiency. Increasing the concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) or flow rate resulted in faster virus transport velocity, higher peak-concentrations and mass recoveries, and lower apparent collision efficiencies. The dual-role of colloids in transport viruses has important implications for risk analysis and remediation of virus-contaminated sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The carbon content (DOC) and the optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) of the coloured DOM fraction (CDOM) of these materials were determined. Cu and Pb complexation properties were measured by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) and the effect of DOM on Cu and Pb bioavailability was studied by means of the Paracentrotus lividus embryo-larval bioassay. Sediment elutriates and sewage-influenced water (1) were enriched 1.4-1.7 times in DOC; (2) absorbed and reemitted more light; and (3) presented higher Cu complexation capacities (L-Cu) than the natural seawater used for their preparation. L-Cu varied from 0.08 mu M in natural seawater to 0.3 and 0.5 mu M in sediment elutriates and sewage-influenced water, respectively. Differences in DOC, CDOM and Cu complexation capacities were reflected in Cu toxicity. DOM enriched samples presented a Cu EC50 of 0.64 mu M, significantly higher than the Cu EC50 Of natural and artificial seawater, which was 0.38 mu M. The protecting effect of DOM on Cu toxicity greatly disappeared when the samples were irradiated with high intensity UV-light. Cu toxicity could be successfully predicted considering ASV-labile Cu concentrations in the samples. Pb complexation by DOM was only detected in the DOM-enriched samples and caused little effect on Pb EC50. This effect was contrary for both elutriates: one elutriate reduced Pb toxicity in comparison with the control artificial seawater, while the other increased it. UV irradiation of the samples caused a marked increase in Pb toxicity, which correlated with the remaining DOC concentration. DOM parameters were related to Cu speciation and toxicity: good correlations were found between DOC and Cu EC50, while L-Cu correlated better with the fluorescence of marine humic substances. The present results stress the importance of characterizing not only the amount but also the quality of seawater DOM to better predict ecological effects from total metal concentration data.

Water samples were collected during a 3.5 year period, from October 2001 through March 2005. in the vicinity of the Cape Fear River (CFR) outlet and adjacent Onslow Bay (OB). Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of CDOM EEM spectra identified six components: three terrestrial humic-like, one marine humic-like and two protein-like. Empirical relationships were derived from the PARAFAC model between DOC concentration and a(CDOM)(350). total fluorescence intensity and the intensities of respective EEM components. DOC concentration and CDOM optical parameters were very well correlated and R(2) values ranged from 0.77 to 0.90. Regression analyses revealed that the non-absorbing DOC fraction, in DOC concentration estimated from CDOM optical parameters, varied with the qualitative composition of the COOK DOC concentration and intensity of the humic-like CDOM components c by excitation maxima at longer wavelengths have significantly higher estimated non-absorbing DOC compared to the analogous relationships between DOC and intensity of the humic-like CDOM components characterized by excitation maxima at shorter wavelengths. The relationships between DOC concentration and intensity of one of the protein-like components resulted in significantly reduced non-absorbing DOC fraction in DOC concentration estimation. Results of regression analyses between fluorescence intensities of specific EEM components and CDOM-specific absorption coefficients suggest that the relative proportion of humic-like CDOM components (characterized by excitation maximum at longer wavelengths) and the main protein-like component have the most impact on the values of a(CDOM)*(350). Based on the relationships between a(CDOM)(350), Cape Fear River flow, and DOC concentrations, DOC fluxes were estimated for 2002, 2003 and 2004. DOC fluxes varied from 1.5 to 6.2 x 10(10) g C yr(-1), depending on river flow. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These materials are all easily accessible and certified for diverse organic constituents (NIST and IHSS). They represent a suite of natural environmental matrices (from solids to aqueous) and are characterized by a wide range of organic carbon and lignin concentrations with abundant proportions of all major LOP. The variability of LOP concentrations and signatures for all these materials averages 3-5% and does not exceed 10%. Using these standards, a new quantification method was developed and validated for the determination of low-level CuO oxidation products using capillary gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS-MS). Tandem mass spectrometry provides both the high sensitivity and selectivity required for the identification and quantification of trace levels of dissolved lignin. The method is particularly useful for removing interference from co-eluting isotopes generated from the DOM matrix and during glucose amendment procedures of low-carbon samples. Such glucose amendment is not necessary, however, when the CuO to organic carbon weight-to-weight ratio can be kept at a value <200-300. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, temporal and spatial variability of DOM composition and thus its quality in such rivers, on landscape and basin scales, have not been well documented. In this study, we present data on the spatial distribution of DOM quantity and quality based on source, molecular weight, and composition using optical properties including excitation emission matrix fluorescence with parallel factor analysis. We compared such DOM quantity and quality determinations in main river channels and their tributaries for three river systems of the Guayana Shield, Venezuela. Spatial variabilities of DOM parameters were strongly related to differences in the geological settings of the drainage basins and presumably their associated vegetation cover. Linear relationships between quantitative and qualitative DOM parameters were also evident, suggesting that high DOC concentration correlated with chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) characteristics of higher molecular weight associated with terrestrial sources, while low DOC concentrations correlated with CDOM characteristics of lower molecular weight associated primarily with microbial sources. Such relationships seem to imply that DOM concentrations and their sources/characteristics may be coupled in the studied fluvial systems. In addition, shifts in DOM compositions between terrestrial and microbial signals were observed with changes in water discharge and in watersheds disturbed by gold mining activities. The observed linkages between, and the changes among DOM quantity and quality, suggest that the biogeochemistry of DOM in tropical rivers may be quite sensitive to climatic and land use change.

Online High-Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance for the Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The substantial heterogeneity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) inhibits detailed chromatographic analysis with conventional detectors as little structural information can be obtained in the presence of extensive coelution. Here we examine the direct hyphenation of high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine how size-distinguished fractions differ in composition. The results support the applicability of using HPSEC to generate more homogeneous fractions of DOM prior to NMR analysis and demonstrate that structure is significantly altered with size. The largest fractions are enriched in carbohydrate- and aromatic-type structures. The midsized material is substantial and is representative of carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAMS). The smallest material has strong signatures of material derived from linear terpenoids (MDLT). Both CRAMS and MOLT have been recently hypothesized as major components of DOM, and detection by HPSEC-NMR confirms their existence as unique and separable entities. This preliminary work focuses on MAR hyphenation to HPSEC due to widespread use of HPSEC to characterize DOM. Online hyphenation is useful not only for time-efficient analysis of DOM but also for that of other highly complex samples such as those found in many environmental analyses.

High-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) as separation method was coupled with diode-array detection (DAD) and separated molecular fractions of DOM were subject to qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis based on UV-spectra revealed the presence of proteins and humic constituents in separated high molecular weight fraction and aromatic constituents in low molecular weight fraction. Statistical data treatment methods enabled clustering sediment layers into 4 periods according to sediment depth and age. The upper 0-30 cm sediment DOM had statistically relevant differences in comparison to other periods as revealed by lower total peak and humic substances (HS) fraction areas, and molecular weights. Samples from 80-120 cm depth differed from others by decreased low molecular weight (LMW) fraction content. The observed down-core trends suggest polymerization of LMW organic constituents and increasing humification. The statistical analyses revealed that some chromatographic and spectrometric parameters can be used to differentiate between sediment layers and to evaluate environmental changes.

Although the forms and transformations of DOM in temperate aquatic and soil environments have been studied extensively, this is not the case for glacial environments. In this study, fluorescent excitation emission matrices (EEMs), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and cluster analysis were used to characterize the fluorescing components of DOM in ice and water samples from supraglacial, englacial, subglacial and proglacial environments of seven glaciers in the Canadian Arctic, Norway and Antarctica. At least five significant fluorescent DOM fractions were identified, which accounted for 98.2% of the variance in the dataset. These included four protein-like components and one humic-like component. The predominantly proteinaceous character of DOM from these glaciers is very different from the more humic character of DOM described previously from lacustrine, fluvial, estuarine and marine environments. DOM from the sampled glaciers is broadly similar in character despite their geographically distinct locations, different thermal regimes and inter- and intra-site differences in potential organic matter sources. Glacier ice samples had a relatively low ratio of humiclike : protein-like fluorescence while meltwater samples had a higher ratio.

Changes in the optical conditions in these lakes have direct impacts on ecosystem productivity, carbon dynamics and nutrient availability. A central role in the underwater light climate is played by dissolved organic matter which is present in all aquatic ecosystems. The chromophoric fraction of these compounds can mediate ecosystem change through its influence on the attenuation of ultraviolet and PAR radiation, microbial carbon cycling and radiative transfer. In the African Great Lakes, little information is available regarding the dynamics of dissolved organic matter and those sources and sinks which control its presence in the water column. We present an extensive spatial analysis of three major bays on the Kenyan and Ugandan shores of Lake Victoria. We use these data to examine the dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in different bays and we develop a model to estimate its flow from these bays to the Lake, considering both conservative mixing and photodegradation processes. While some bays release chromophoric dissolved organic matter practically unmodified into the Lake, increased residence time and exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation create conditions where chromophores are lost before entering the open lake.

Seasonal dynamics of dissolved organic matter and microbial activity in the coastal North Sea	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microbial activity were monitored in the coastal North Sea over an annual cycle. DOM accumulated during the spring bloom towards the summer, associated with high phytoplankton extracellular release. Accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) occurred from April to June. During this period, based on the bacterial carbon demand (BCD) of the free-living bacteria and the photosynthetic extracellular release (PER), 85 mu M C were derived from sources other than direct. DOC release by phytoplankton. Thereafter, from the end of August until December, the DOM concentrations decreased by about hall. During this period, at least 269 mu M C was removed from the system via the utilization by the bacterial community and/or sedimentation and export. Overall, our data indicate a pronounced seasonal shift in DOM sources supporting BCD. From spring to summer, BCD is almost fully supported by PER alone while in fall and winter, BCD is supported about equally by PER and by the DOM accumulated in the spring-summer period and originating presumably from a variety of DOM production mechanisms.

Initial concentrations varied from 73 to 94 mu M for DOC, 4.5 to 7.2 mu M for DON and 0.12 to 0.32 mu M for DOP. The bioavailable fraction (BDOM) represented 17 +/- 6% (average +/- SE) of DOC, 38 +/- 6% of DON and 65 +/- 9% of DOP. BDOM was significantly correlated with temperature (R(2) > 0.3, p < 0.05) and chlorophyll a (R(2) > 0.5, p < 0.05), indicating that the differences in DOM bioavailability were associated with the seasonal variations in plankton biomass and activity. The C:N:P stoichiometry of BDOM, 111 ( 38):18 ( 6):l, was not significantly different from the Redfield ratio (106:16:1), pointing to a phytoplankton origin of BDOM. Accordingly, exponential rate constants of BDOM suggest that this pool is very labile. Despite the reduced flushing times of the Ria de Vigo, from 3 to 8 d, as much as 70 +/- 13 % of BDOC (average +/- SD), 81 +/- 8 % of BDON and 88 +/- 5 % of BDOP are mineralized within the embayment. The remaining C-rich BDOM is exported to the adjacent oligotrophic waters, suggesting that the offshore transport of labile DOM must be accounted for when considering the carbon balance of ocean surface waters adjacent to productive coastal areas.

This study aims to investigate the variation in the absorption coefficients of TSM and CDOM of inland waters. A total of 92 water samples were collected from Shitoukoumen Reservoir and Songhua Lake in Northeast China, analyzed for TSM and Chl-a, and measured for the absorption coefficient of TSM, CDOM and total pigments using a laboratory spectrophotometer. The absorption coefficient of TSM has been decomposed for phytoplankton and inorganic sediments. The results show that for Shitoukoumen Reservoir, CDOM has strong absorptions with shallow absorption slopes (i.e., the coefficient S in a(lambda)=a(lambda(0))exp[-S(lambda- lambda(0))]) and large absorption at 355 nm; and for Songhua Lake, CDOM follows similar spectral absorption curves but less variation in the S value. The results also show TSM has the average absorption coefficient 5.7 m(-1) at 440 nm and 0.93 m(-1) at 675 nm, and their concentration is well correlated to TSM with R-2 larger than 0.85 at 440 nm over both Songhu Lake and Shitoukoumen Reservoir. In summer, CDOM was mainly terrigenous and had a high proportion of humic acid derived from the decomposition of phytoplankton and there were no obvious difference of S value. The results indicate that inorganic sediments contributed much more absorption than phytoplankton pigments in Shitoukoumen Reservoir than that in Songhua Lake, and there is strong association of TSM concentration to absorption coefficient at 440 nm.																	0277-786X		978-0-81948-307-2				2010	7811								78110B	10.1117/12.859634						WOS:000285830200007

Characterisation of dissolved organic matter in water extracts of thermally altered plant species found in box-ironbark forests	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH												This study investigated the chemical structure of extracted dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from thermally altered plant material found in the box-ironbark environments of central Victoria, namely: Eucalyptus tricarpa, Pinus pinaceae, Isolepsis nodosa, Acacia pycnantha, and Cassinia arcuata. Samples taken from the plants were burnt at 150, 300, and 400 degrees C, under oxidising and reducing conditions in order to represent the variable combustion undergone by plants during bushfire events. The extraction of DOM from the burnt residues into water was conducted over 96 h. During the extraction period, solution concentrations of DOM were measured using HPLC and TOC methods, while the chemistry of the extracted DOM was characterised using ATR-IR. The nature of the extracted DOM depended on the originating species and whether burnt under oxidising or reducing conditions. DOM derived from the residues of the Australian native trees and shrubs (E. tricarpa, A. pycnantha, and C. arcuata) were generally more aromatic and conjugated than the materials extracted from herbaceous I. nodosa and introduced dendrophyte P. pinaceae. When burnt under reducing conditions, fire residues were less polar, indicated by the fact that they were significantly less soluble and ATR-IR spectra spectroscopy showed little OH stretching compared with the extracts obtained under oxidising conditions. Water extracts from the burnt residues sorbed strongly to the mineral goethite, but had less affinity for the kaolinite surface.																	0004-9573						2010	48	8					693	704		10.1071/SR09157						WOS:000284360600005

Fluorescence and absorption properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in coastal surface waters of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, influence of the Rhone River	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Seawater samples were collected monthly in surface waters (2 and 5m depths) of the Bay of Marseilles (northwestern Mediterranean Sea; 5 degrees 17 ' 3 '' E, 43 degrees 14 ' 3 '' N) during one year from November 2007 to December 2008 and studied for total organic carbon (TOC) as well as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence). The annual mean value of surface CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm [a(CDOM)(350)] was very low (0.10 +/- 0.02 m(-1)) in comparison to values usually found in coastal waters, and no significant seasonal trend in a(CDOM)(350) could be determined. By contrast, the spectral slope of CDOM absorption (S(CDOM)) was significantly higher (0.023 +/- 0.003 nm(-1)) in summer than in fall and winter periods (0.017 +/- 0.002 nm-1), reflecting either CDOM photobleaching or production in surface waters during stratified sunny periods. The CDOM fluorescence, assessed through excitation emission matrices (EEMs), was dominated by protein-like component (peak T; 1.30-21.94 QSU) and marine humic-like component (peak M; 0.55-5.82 QSU), while terrestrial humic-like fluorescence (peak C; 0.34-2.99 QSU) remained very low. This reflected a dominance of relatively fresh material from biological origin within the CDOM fluorescent pool. At the end of summer, surface CDOM fluorescence was very low and strongly blue shifted, reinforcing the hypothesis of CDOM photobleaching. Our results suggested that unusual Rhone River plume eastward intrusion events might reach Marseilles Bay within 2-3 days and induce local phytoplankton blooms and subsequent fluorescent CDOM production (peaks M and T) without adding terrestrial fluorescence signatures (peaks C and A). Besides Rhone River plumes, mixing events of the entire water column injected relative aged (peaks C and M) CDOM from the bottom into the surface and thus appeared also as an important source of CDOM in surface waters of the Marseilles Bay. Therefore, the assessment of CDOM optical properties, within the hydrological context, pointed out several biotic (in situ biological production, biological production within Rhone River plumes) and abiotic (photobleaching, mixing) factors controlling CDOM transport, production and removal in this highly urbanized coastal area.

The age of the 4m long sediment core was estimated using the 14C dating method and suggested sediment accumulation for the past 10,000 years. Using the HPSEC approach it was possible to evaluate temporal changes in the content of DOM and its molecular weight characteristics during the Holocene period. The content of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) calculated from spectroscopic data was in good correlation with the total peak areas computed from HPSEC chromatograms. The results revealed that the content of detected DOC in the older samples 10,300 to 2,600 years before present (BP) was twice as high as in the younger ones (from 2,400 years BP to present). Thus, HPSEC analysis with spectroscopic methods might provide useful information about temporal changes in DOM content and could be used in palaeolimnological research.																	0275-7540						2010	26			2			13	24	PII 927468383	10.1080/02757540.2010.501030						WOS:000282574200002

Influence of dissolved organic matter on rare earth elements and yttrium distributions in coastal waters	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Data collected during this study indicate that dissolved Y and REE (rare earth element) behaviour can be monitored through shale-normalised ratios. Relationships occurring between these ratios suggest that leaching from lithogenic materials is the main source of REE in the studied area. This process involves riverine detrital matter in the inner area of the Gulf of Palermo. Features of shale-normalised patterns and the relationship recognised between dissolved Fe and Y/Ho suggest that REE are released from Fe-rich coatings of atmospheric dust. Observed similarities between dissolved Fe and chlorophyll- content suggest that leaching of Fe-rich atmospheric particulates induces a fertilisation of shallow water layers influencing the dissolved organic content. In turn, the increasing chlorophyll- content causes a progressive decrease in amplitude of the negative Ce anomaly in seawater that is also observed in water in the Central Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that organic matter generally plays a key role in REE behaviour at the solid-liquid interface. Shale-normalised REE features recognised in suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate the occurrence of three different fractions from lithogenic matter, biogenic carbonates and authigenic components, respectively. The latter is formed during REE scavenging onto the surface of detrital biogenic particles and is mainly recognised in inner gulf waters.

Comparing the effect of plant composition and substrate on DOM, and analyzing the sources of DOM in eutrophic water. The results showed : (1) All the samples were analyzed in the study, two fulvic-like and two protein-like were characterized, and the fluorescence peak of visible fulvic-like (marked M), UV fulvic-like (marked A), and tyrosine-like(marked S) were clear, the fluorescence peak of tryptophan-like was not clear. (2) Decreasing rate of fluorescence spectrophoto- metric of fulvic-like from water samples by treatment of three different CVFWs: CVFW-1 > CVFW-2 > CVFW-3, Decreasing rate of fluorescence spectrophotometric of protein-like from water samples by treatment of three different CVFWs: CVFW-2 > CVFW-1 > CVFW-3. It appears the different substrate and plants would have a significant impact on the purifying effect of constructed wetlands: Gravel better than shale; the combination of Cyperus alternifolius and Canna generalis. Better than the combination Juncus effusus L. and Acorns calamus Linn. This is the reason the purifying effect of CVFW-1 and CVFW-2 were better than the purifying effect of CVFW-3. (3)The values of f450/500 ranged from 1.674 to 1.796, r(S, M) ranged from 0.734 to 0.834, r(A, M) ranged from 1.396 to 1.465. By analysising these parameters of DOM, it is possible that dissolved organic matter in the water is relatively simple structure, its comes mainly from the life of phytoplankton and microbial activity or the residue decomposition.																			978-1-935068-16-7				2010							946	950								WOS:000289700000211

This study describes pilot scale experiments for efficient removal of dissolved organic and nitrogen compounds by using ASBF. This research explores the possibility of enhancing the performance of shallow wastewater treatment lagoons through the addition of specially designed structures. These structures are designed to encourage the growth of a nitrifying bacterial bio-film on a submerged surface. These structures also force the direct contact of rising air bubbles against the submerged bio-film. This direct gas-phase contact should increase the oxygen transfer rate into the bio-film, as well as increase the micro-climate mixing of water, nutrients, and waste products into and out of the bio-film. This research investigated the efficiency of dissolved organic matter and ammonia nitrogen removals at cold temperatures. As it was anticipated, nitrification activity was highest during periods when the flow rate was lower, but it seemed to decline during times when the flow rate was highest. And ammonia nitrogen removal rates were more sensitive than dissolved organic matter removal rates when flow rates exceeded 2.2 L/min. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using aqueous geochemical modelling, we show that natural dissolved organic matter (DOM), even at low concentrations (similar to 3 mg L(-1)), controls the Hg speciation by forming strong Hg-DOM and CH(3)Hg-DOM complexes through the reactive sulfur or thiol-like functional groups in DOM in the contaminated East Fork Poplar Creek at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Concentrations of neutral Hg(OH)(2), Hg(OH) Cl, CH(3)HgCl, and CH(3)HgOH species are negligible. Of the coexisting metal ions, only Zn(2+), at concentrations of 1.6-2.6 x 10(-7) M, competes with Hg(2+) for binding with DOM, causing decrease in Hg-DOM complexation but having little impact on CH(3)Hg-DOM complexation. DOM may thus play a dominant role in controlling the transformation, biological uptake, and methylation of Hg in this contaminated ecosystem.

Dissolved Organic Matter Sources and Consequences for Iron and Arsenic Mobilization in Bangladesh Aquifers	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Iron (Fe) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling have been implicated in arsenic mobilization via microbially mediated Fe oxide reduction. To evaluate the sources and multiple roles of DOM in Bangladesh aquifers,we conducted spectroscopic analyses on various types of surface water and groundwater samples from a site representative of aquifer chemistry and hydrology. Surface water contained humic substances with oxidized quinone-like moieties and high concentrations of labile microbially derived DOM. In contrast in shallow groundwater where dissolved iron and arsenic concentrations were high, the quinone-like moieties of humic substances were more reduced, with less abundant labile DOM than that of surface water. Instead, DOM at these depths was characterized by terrestrial (plant/soil) signatures. A sediment microcosm experiment demonstrated that Fe(II) and terrestrially derived DOM were released from sediment over time. The results provide new evidence to support a dual role of natural DOM in Bangladesh aquifers (1) as a labile substrate for Fe- and humic-reducing bacteria and (2) as an electron shuttle via humic substances to enhance microbial iron reduction. Fluorescence index, amino acid-like fluorescence, and redox index may serve as useful indicators of the type of DOM likely to be involved in Fe solubilization and potentially As mobilization reactions.

Along a salinity gradient, composite soil samples of different depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) were collected from five native halophyte communities and two conventional tillage farmlands in the mid-west of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. A humification index (HIX) obtained from emission fluorescence spectra showed a negative correlation with soil salinity (R-2=0.56 and P=0.0002). In synchronous fluorescence spectra, intensities of fulvic acid peaks increased with rise in salinity, while the intensity of protein peaks increased with the decrease of in salinity. Humification indices showed a close negative correlation with the salinity (R-2 >= 0.51 and P <= 0.0002). Except the community of Phragmites australis (CPA), the protein peaks were observed in lower salinity soil samples in excitation emission fluorescence matrix (EEFM), and there was a good positive correlation between r((A,C)) and the salinity (R-2=0.43 and P=0.01). The results indicate that the salinity is an important factor of the process of soil humification. The humificaton indices closely related to ESP (exchangeable sodium percentage), indicating that ESP can be used as an indicator to evaluate the level of salinization.																	1018-4619						2010	19	5A					963	971								WOS:000279092700008

However, it is still unclear whether plant burning can also produce enough dissolved organic matter (DOM) to affect the regional environment. In order to investigate this issue, we analyzed the contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in plant ash derived from simulated burning. The results showed that the ash of wetland plants contained a certain amount of DOM. The DOC contents in plant ash ranged from 48.6 +/- 13.1 mg.kg(-1) to 232.3 +/- 62.6 mg.kg(-1), and DON contents in plant ash ranged from 18.7 +/- 3.6 mg.kg(-1) to 232.3 +/- 6.7 mg.kg(-1). In addition, the contents of DOC, DIC and DON in ash varied with the vegetation species in wetland ecosystem. There were greater DIC and DON in the shrub plant ash than in the herbage plant ash, while the ratio of DOC and TC was lower than in the shrub plant ash. There was a reason to believe that plant ash derived from fire did play an important role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems, and DOM in plant ash did contribute to the regional and global environmental changes.																	1018-4619						2010	19	11					2518	2522								WOS:000285076800007

DOG concentrations were almost similar in those two lakes, but higher (169-330 mu M C. average 223 +/- 36 mu M C) in the epilimnion (0-8 m), and lower (151-303 mu M C, 193 +/- 25 mu M C) in the hypolimnion (10-25 m). Five fluorescence peaks (peaks M and A of fulvic acid-like: peak C of fulvic acid-like or autochthonous DOM-like: peaks T and T-UV of tryptophan-like components, respectively) were observed in the lake waters, indicating various sources of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in lakes. The fluorescence intensities of those peaks decreased (3-61%) in the epilimnion during the summer stratification period compared to hypolimnion. Chl a concentrations were 2.7-65.5 mu g I-I in the epilimnion and 1.4-41.0 mu g l(-1) in hypolimnion with the maximum level in July when water temperature (WT) was the highest of the year. DOG concentrations were significantly correlated with Chl a and WT. Chl a was well correlated with WT in the epilimnion of Lake Hongfeng, suggesting that biological activities might he a major DOG source in the lake waters. DOG concentrations were weakly correlated or not correlated with fulvic acid-like fluorescence in the epilimnion, but they were significantly correlated with tryptophan-like fluorescence, indicating that the tryptophan-like fluorescent material was from new DOM in the lakes during the summer period. But these correlations were often insignificant or absent in the waters of Lake Baihua except peaks T and T-UV, which may be caused by the input of organic contaminants from the industrial activities near Lake Baihua. This study may assist to better understand the sources of lake DOM and the effects of organic matter pollution on the biogeochemical cycling of DOM in lake environments.

Brilliant Blue was used as a tracer to assess the effect of preferential flow on Cd down migration. Experimental results showed that deep penetration of Cd and Brilliant Blue into the soil profile took place due to the preferential flow through macropores, mainly earthworm channels, with much of chemicals thus bypassing the soil matrix. Dye tracer and Cd distribution within the soil matrix was fairly restricted to several centimeters. Colloid restrained the migration of both dye and Cd in the matrix and preferential flow area. DOM facilitated the transport of Cd and Brilliant Blue in matrix and macropores by about 10 cm over that of the control. Pearson's is correlation analysis revealed strong associations between Brilliant Blue concentrations, exchangeable Cd and total Cd concentrations in three studied plots indicating that they had taken the same preferential flow pathway.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2010	22	1					106	115		10.1016/S1001-0742(09)60081-4						WOS:000273860800015		
J	Zhang, MK; Zhang, HM				Zhang, Mingkui; Zhang, Huimin			Co-transport of dissolved organic matter and heavy metals in soils induced by excessive phosphorus applications	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												To evaluate the effects of long-term applications of phosphorus fertilizers on mobility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and heavy metals in agricultural soils, a sandy soil and a loamy soil were spiked with ammonium phosphate at application rates of 0, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg P per kilogram of soil. A series of 15-cm long soil columns were constructed by packing incubated soils of varying concentrations of P. The soil columns were consecutively leached by simulated rainfalls for six cycles. The contents of water extractable organic carbon in both sandy and loamy soils increased significantly with increasing rates of P applications. Relatively high rates of P applications could induce a marked increase in DOM concentrations in the leachates, the effects were larger with the sandy soil rather than with the loamy soil. Applications of P changed the partitioning of trace metals in the soil solids and the soil solutions. The increased P application rates also seemed to elevate the leaching of Cu, Cd, and Zn from soils. The concentrations of Cu, Cd, and Zn in the leachates were positively correlated with DOM, probably due to the formation of metal-DOM complexes. In contrast, Pb concentrations in the leachates were negatively correlated with DOM, and decreased with increasing rates of P applications. The boosted leaching of DOM induced by high rates of P applications was probably due to the added phosphate ions competing for adsorption sites in the soil solids with the indigenous DOM.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2010	22	4					598	606		10.1016/S1001-0742(09)60151-0						WOS:000276780700018	20617738

Values of soil enzymatic activity depended mainly on incubation time. In the initial 16 days, urease activity increased, and was followed by a decrease. In the initial 8 days, catalase activity decreased and then increased. Variation of polyphenol oxidase activity was just the reverse of catalase activity. After 30 days of incubation, no pronounced difference among treatments with Phe, Phe and DOM, and control were detected in urease, catalase and polyphenol oxidase activity. Phe might inhibit urease and catalase, and stimulate polyphenol oxidase. DOM could improve inhibition of Phe in soil urease and catalase activity during the initial period of applying DOM. Nevertheless, DOM had no significant effect on polyphenol oxidase activity in the Phe contaminated soil. There was a negative correlation between catalase and polyphenol oxidase (r = -0.761***), and catalase and urease (r = -0.554**). Additionally, a positive correlation between polyphenol oxidase and urease was also detected (r = 0.701***). It is implied that the formed DOM after application of organic wastes into soils may counteract the inhibition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil enzyme activities.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2010	22	4					607	614		10.1016/S1001-0742(09)60139-x						WOS:000276780700019	20617739

P tricornutum incubated in f/2 medium was exposed to DOM additives, which were extracted from the plant and sediment samples of a salt marsh in North Branch of the Yangtze estuary, China. During 12 days incubation, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of P tricornutum were measured by a Phyto-PAM phytoplankton analyzer. Spectral properties of DOM in algae filtrates were also observed. The concentrations of chlorophyll a, active chlorophyll a, and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II significantly decreased after four days of incubation, suggesting that the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of P tricornutum were inhibited. After adding sediment-DOM extract, both a(250)/a(365) (the ratio of the absorption coefficients at 250 and 365 nm) and S values (spectral slope coefficients) of algae filtrates declined in the first two days, which demonstrated a loss of low molecular weight DOM. Parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra of DOM in algae filtrates revealed that DOM could be classified into two humic-like and two protein-like components. The fluorescence intensity of tyrosine-like component originating from algae increased significantly during incubation. This study supports the hypothesis that allochthonous DOM derived from salt marsh plant and sediment have a strong influence on the adjacent aquatic ecosystems.

Parallel factor analysis modeling of excitation-emission matrix spectra revealed five fluorescent components occurring in sewage DOM: one protein-like (Cl), three humic-like (C2, C4 and C5) and one xenobiotic-like (C3) components. During the aerated grit chamber and primary sedimentation tank stage, there was only a slight decrease in fluorescence intensity and the absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350)). During the second aeration stage, high concentration of protein-like and short-wavelength-excited humic-like components were significantly degraded accompanied by significant loss of DOC (80%) and a(350) (30%), indicating that Cl and C2 were the dominant constituents of sewage DOM. As a result, long-wavelength-excited C4 and C5 became the dominant humic-like components and the DOM molecular size inferred from the variation of spectral slope S (300-650 nm) and specific absorption (a(280)/DOC) increased. Combination use of F-max of C 1 and the ratio of C1/C5, or a(350) may provide a quantitative indication for the relative amount of raw or treated sewage in aquatic environment.

Regulation of the nitrogen biogeochemistry of mountain lakes by subsidies of terrestrial dissolved organic matter and the implications for climate studies	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Stable isotopes of nitrogen (N) were analyzed in modern sediments of mountain lakes, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and sediment cores spanning the past 12,000 yr to test the hypothesis that spatial and temporal (100-1000 yr) variation in the N content of mountain lakes is regulated by influx of allochthonous DOM. Analysis of spatial patterns in an elevation gradient of 75 mountain lakes revealed that most N was associated with DOM rather than inorganic N, particularly in subalpine lakes (< 1700 m above sea level). Similarly, analysis of N isotope ratios (delta(15)N) from 22 lakes showed that whole sediments of subalpine sites were significantly more depleted (0.74% +/- 1.58 parts per thousand) than were those of alpine lakes above 2200 m (3.04 parts per thousand +/- 1.21 parts per thousand), consistent with the depleted delta(15)N of isolated DOM (similar to 1.3 parts per thousand). Sedimentary delta(15)N values of Crowfoot Lake, presently near tree line, also varied greatly during the past 12,000 yr, with enriched values (similar to parts per thousand) during the alpine phases of the lake's history and depleted values (similar to 1 parts per thousand) during the intervening subalpine phase (ca. 10,050- 4160 (14)C yr before present) when DOM was abundant. In contrast, sedimentary delta(15)N values remained constant (similar to 2.5 parts per thousand) at Snowflake Lake, an alpine reference site that never experienced a DOM- rich subalpine phase. These analyses suggest that climate regulates N influx and lake biogeochemistry by changing the subsidies of terrestrial DOM, and warn that future climate change may initially reduce N influx on a decadal scale by reducing hydrologic transfer before increasing N subsidies on a centennial scale by increasing terrestrial production of DOM.

Our results prove that the four species exuded both fluorescent protein-like and marine humic-like materials in variable amounts, with more production by the diatoms Chaetoceros sp. and Skeletonema costatum and less by Prorocentrum minimum. Whereas the exudation of protein-like substances by healthy phytoplankton cells has been recognized, the in situ production of marine humic-like substances is still a matter of debate. Using axenic cultures, we demonstrate unequivocally that phytoplankton can directly contribute to the autochthonous production of colored humic-like substances in the ocean. Extrapolation of these findings to the field indicates that about 20% of the marine humic-like substances produced in the highly productive coastal upwelling system of the Ria de Vigo could originate from growing phytoplankton. Therefore, the exudation of FDOM by marine phytoplankton should be considered in future studies of the dynamics of colored DOM in marine systems.

Sorption and desorption dynamics of bulk dissolved organic matter and amino acids in the Mississippi River plume - a microcosm study	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Particulate and dissolved carbon, nitrogen and amino acids were analysed in a microcosm experiment where particulate material from the Mississippi River was mixed with surface waters of different salinities (2.0, 20.4 and 28.9) collected from the Mississippi River plume. There was evidence for the partitioning of amino acids in different salinity treatments during a 24-h period. Dissolved amino acids in the productive mid-salinity region of the plume had higher binding efficiencies than did amino acids from non-productive waters, indicative of the relative importance of phytoplankton sources of reactive amino acids. Basic amino acids were adsorbed more readily to particles, whereas acidic amino acids remained in the dissolved pool, indicating that electrostatic mechanisms affected amino-acid partitioning. Neutral amino-acid enrichment onto the particles was proportional to their respective hydrophobicity. Because riverine particles enter the higher salinity-shelf waters of the Mississippi River plume, changing ionic strength is a key in controlling amino-acid sorption and desorption kinetics. We propose that the short-term partitioning of amino acids between dissolved and particulate amino-acid pools across salinity gradients in the plume were affected by (1) electrostatic characteristics of suspended riverine sediment surfaces, (2) the availability of 'freshly' produced amino acids from phytoplankton and (3) the functional groups of amino acids.																	1323-1650						2010	61	9					1067	1081		10.1071/MF09181						WOS:000282089200014

DOM affects the marine plankton community where rivers discharge into the sea. Large DOM molecules have been suggested to be more available to aquatic plankton than smaller ones due to their more recent origin in the degradation process. In this study, we investigated the effect of riverine DOM molecular size on coastal plankton with the hypothesis that nitrogen associated with large molecules stimulates the plankton more than nitrogen in smaller molecules. Three size fractions of riverine DOM were isolated with tangential ultrafiltration and introduced at similar nitrogen concentrations to mesocosms with a natural coastal marine plankton community under nitrogen limiting conditions. The results show that growth of bacteria and dinoflagellates, but not diatoms, was stimulated by addition of large DOM molecules. Even though organic nitrogen concentrations tended to decrease more in large DOM treatments compared to smaller DOM treatments, no significant differences were detected. However, proteolytic enzyme activities were elevated in treatments with the largest DOM molecules, suggesting that more organic nitrogen was utilized in this treatment. We suggest that input of larger river DOM molecules to nitrogen limited coastal systems may influence the composition of the coastal phytoplankton community in favour of dinoflagellates.

(1999) and GSM01 (Maritorena at al. 2002) for estimating CDOM absorption in the Baltic Sea. The data set includes coincident measurements of radiometric quantities and absorption coefficients of CDOM made during 43 cruises between 2000 and 2008. In the first stage of the analysis, the accuracy of the empirical algorithm by Kowalczuk et al. (2005) was assessed using in situ measurements of remote sensing reflectance. Validation results improved when matching points located in Gulf of Gdansk close to the Vistula River mouth were eliminated from the data set. The calculated errors in the estimation of a(CDOM) (400) in the first phase of the analysis were Bias = -0.02, RMSE = 0.46 and R-2 = 0.70. In the second stage, the empirical algorithm was tested on satellite data from SeaWiFS and MODIS imagery. The satellite data were corrected atmospherically with the MUMM algorithm designed for turbid coastal and inland waters and implemented in the SeaDAS software. The results of the best case scenario for estimating the CDOM absorption coefficient a(CDOM) (400), based on SeaWiFS data, were Bias = -0.02, RMSE = 0.23 and R-2 = 0.40. The validation of the Kowalczuk et al. (2005) empirical algorithm applied to MODIS data led to a less accurate estimate of a(CDOM)(400): Bias = -0.03, RMSE = 0.19 and R-2 = 0.29. This assessment of the accuracy of standard semi-analytical algorithms available in the SeaWiFS and MODIS imagery processing software revealed that both algorithms (GSM_01 and Carder) underestimate CDOM absorption in the Baltic Sea with mean systematic and random errors in excess of 70%. The paper presents examples of the application of the Kowalczuk et al. (2005) empirical algorithm for producing maps of the seasonal distribution of a(CDOM)(400) in the Baltic Sea between 2004 and 2008.

Ozone Application during Coagulation of Wastewater: Effect on Dissolved Organic Matter	OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												The aim of this work was to determine the effect of ozone on dissolved organic matter (DOM) during wastewater coagulation using alum. Adding ozone to the coagulation treatment (O3ECT) enhanced the quality of the final effluent in comparison to conventional coagulation treatment (CT). Final effluents were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The hydrophilic polar fraction was separated from the hydrophobic fraction using fractionation resins XAD-8 and XAD-4. Wastewater hydrophilic DOM was characterized by molecular weight distribution (MWD), and, BOD5, TOC and DOC parameters. Results show that FTIR spectra for both effluents were very similar in the frequency range 7000 to 1400 cm-1; however, some differences occurred in the O3ECT effluent in the range 1100 to 700 cm-1, which indicated that amines and aromatics groups were affected. In the same way, the UV-Vis spectra showed that there was an increase in absorbance within the wavelength range 285 to 300 nm for the O3ECT effluent (when compared with CT) while the absorbance decreased in the range 210 to 455 nm, particularly at 380 nm. With regards to the hydrophilic polar compounds of DOM, the most abundant fraction in raw wastewater was found in the 3-10 kDa range. After CT, the effluents fraction concentrations decreased in all cases, but for O3ECT the 10-30 kDa range exhibited a marked increase while the smaller (3 kDa, 3-10 kDa) and larger fractions (30 kDa) decreased. The ozone application during coagulation slightly increased TOC and DOC percentage removals, 84.4% to 89.1% and 80% to 82.5%, respectively. This suggests that the small dose of ozone transferred (1.47 mg/L) caused only minor changes in DOM. Finally, the O3ECT effluent exhibits 10 mg/L more of biological oxygen demand (BOD5) than a single CT.																	0191-9512	1547-6545					2010	32	5					323	328	PII 927594515	10.1080/01919512.2010.508025						WOS:000282584300005

Experiments were conducted with a medium-pressure Hg lamp in a glass photoreactor (lambda > 290 nm, 220 W m(-2) irradiance between 290 and 400 nm). Steady-state concentration and initial production rate of RPS were determined for HO(center dot) and for (1)O(2). HO(center dot) and (1)O(2) were indirectly identified in the presence of benzene and furfuryl alcohol, respectively, as specific probes. The steady-state measured concentration of HO(center dot)was (1.72 +/- 0.01) x 10(-16) M and (9.41 +/- 0.12) x 10(-17) M for Vaccares and Canal waters samples, respectively, and the respective concentrations of (1)O(2) was (2.06 +/- 0.22) x 10(-13) M and (5.44 +/- 0.04) x 10(-14) M. The interference of (3)CDOM* or other species in the determination of (1)O(2) with furfuryl alcohol, and of (1)O(2) in the quantification of (3)CDOM* with 2,4,6-trimethylphenol was also quantitatively assessed. We developed a kinetic model describing the solar photo-transformation of xenobiotic organic compounds induced by the three different photooxidants HO(center dot), (1)O(2) and (3)CDOM*.

A novel approach was used to describe the shape of CDOM absorption between 250-700 nm (distribution of the spectral slope, S(lambda)) and a new fluorescence ratio is used to distinguish between humic and amino acid-like components. Solar ultraviolet irradiance, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DOM fluorescence and absorption measurements were analysed and compared to other physicochemical parameters. We show that in the UV-exposed mixed layer: (i) fluorescence by autochthonous amino acid-like CDOM, (ii) values of S(lambda) across UV-C and UV-B wavebands increased during the summer months, whereas (i) average molar absorption coefficient and (ii) fluorescence by allochthonous humic CDOM decreased. In the unexposed deep layer of the water column (and in the entire water column in winter), humic-like CDOM presented high values of molar absorption coefficients and low values of S(lambda). UV attenuation coefficients correlated with both chlorophyll a concentrations and CDOM absorption. In agreement with changes in CDOM, minimal values in UV attenuation were found in summer. The S(lambda) curve was used as a signature of the mixture between photobleached and algal-derived CDOM with respect to the unexposed chromophoric dissolved compounds in this thermal stratified lake.

The paper analyses the study period (1996 - 2000) seasonal change of organic matter in the upper reaches of the river Nevezis (study sites upstream and downstream Panevezys). The highest amount of organic matter (according to chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand) got into the river under the influence of concentrated pollution, the fewer amount - under the influence of agricultural pollution and in the course of natural processes. The concentration of organic substances in the river water had a seasonal character: rivers with a better ecological state (the Juosta) were more polluted with organic matter in spring, when water temperature was below 10 degrees C, but rivers with a worse ecological state (the Nevezis upstream and downstream Panevezys) - in summer (water temperature was higher than 10 degrees C). This may be related with fresh pollution; in the former case organic matter might have come from the environment together with the runoff, in the latter case - due to decomposition of water vegetation and fauna residues in the river itself. In all rivers water temperature was by 0.1 - 4.4 degrees C higher in 1996 - 2000 in comparison to that in 1986 1989, a significant temperature increases were observed in winter and autumn. The water temperature arose mostly below the town.																	1691-4031						2010							149	155								WOS:000309844000024

Transformation of dissolved organic matter by oxidative polymerization with horseradish peroxidase	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has significant influence on the transport and fate of contaminants in multiple phases and it has potential hazard by acting as a precursor of disinfection by-products in water supply. The changes in DOM characteristics, especially by oxidative polymerization might result in different behaviour in the interaction with many contaminants. The aim of this work was to verify the catalytic effects of peroxidase on oxidative polymerization of humic and fulvic substances by examination of the structural characteristics. Transformation of humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) by oxidative polymerization catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide were investigated. Size exclusion chromatography, excitation emission matrices spectra (EEMs), synchronous fluorescence spectra, and infrared spectroscopy was used to evaluate the structural transformation of HA and FA. Molecular weight of HA and FA was continuously changed and their weight-average molecular weight (MW(w)) reached maximum after 8 h. The MW(w) of HA and FA were proportionally increased with a dosage of horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide, indicating that HA and FA was transformed into larger and complex molecules. Spectroscopic results indicated that HA and FA structure contains strong polycyclic aromatic structures with more aromatic rings and a higher degree of conjugation.																	0273-1223						2010	62	2					340	346		10.2166/wst.2010.248						WOS:000280586400014	20651438

High-frequency in situ optical measurements during a storm event: Assessing relationships between dissolved organic matter, sediment concentrations, and hydrologic processes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics during storm events has received considerable attention in forested watersheds, but the extent to which storms impart rapid changes in DOM concentration and composition in highly disturbed agricultural watersheds remains poorly understood. In this study, we used identical in situ optical sensors for DOM fluorescence (FDOM) with and without filtration to continuously evaluate surface water DOM dynamics in a 415 km(2) agricultural watershed over a 4 week period containing a short-duration rainfall event. Peak turbidity preceded peak discharge by 4 h and increased by over 2 orders of magnitude, while the peak filtered FDOM lagged behind peak turbidity by 15 h. FDOM values reported using the filtered in situ fluorometer increased nearly fourfold and were highly correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (r(2) = 0.97), providing a highly resolved proxy for DOC throughout the study period. Discrete optical properties including specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), spectral slope (S(290-350)), and fluorescence index (FI) were also strongly correlated with in situ FDOM and indicate a shift toward aromatic, high molecular weight DOM from terrestrially derived sources during the storm. The lag of the peak in FDOM behind peak discharge presumably reflects the draining of watershed soils from natural and agricultural landscapes. Field and experimental evidence showed that unfiltered FDOM measurements underestimated filtered FDOM concentrations by up to similar to 60% at particle concentrations typical of many riverine systems during hydrologic events. Together, laboratory and in situ data provide insights into the timing and magnitude of changes in DOM quantity and quality during storm events in an agricultural watershed, and indicate the need for sample filtration in systems with moderate to high suspended sediment loads.

Size distribution of methylmercury associated with particulate and dissolved organic matter in freshwaters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												water samples were collected from 20 wetland, river and lake sites across Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec to investigate the distribution of methylmercury (MeHg) associated with various size fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Tangential Flow UltraFiltration (TUF) was used to fractionate DOM by nominal molecular size (<0.2 mu m, <300 kDa, <30 kDa, <5 kDa and <1 kDa). DOM fluorescence (DOM FL) and absorbance (DOC Abs) were used to quantify DOM photoreactivity and aromaticity in each sample. Significant differences in the size-associated distribution of MeHg. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). DOM FL, and DOM Abs were observed between wetlands, rivers, and lakes. The low molecular weight (LMW) fraction (<5 kDa) in wetlands contained the majority of MeHg (70.0 +/- 13.8%). DOC (56.1 +/- 9.4%), and DOM FL (77.4 +/- 7.5%). DOM FL was also high in the LMW fraction for rivers (60.6 +/- 25%) and lakes (75.2 +/- 16.9%). Mean MeHg concentrations in the LMW fraction of lakes (41 +/- 26 pg L(-1)) and rivers (32 +/- 19 pg L(-1)) were substantial but much lower than wetlands. Rivers had the highest percentage of methylmercury (38.0 +/- 23.5%) in the particulate (>0.2 mu m) fraction. This research highlights the importance of low molecular weight dissolved organic matter in methylmercury fate. For example, a large proportion of MeHg was found in the LMW weight fractions (mean = 47.3 +/- 25.4%) of the wetlands, rivers. and lakes in this study. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The concentration of CDOM, determined by its absorption coefficient at wavelength lambda = 380 nm, ranged from 4.17 to 22.3 m(-1) in Peipsi, from 3.96 to 15.7 m(-1) in Vortsjarv and from 2.24 to 32.9 m(-1) in Parnu Bay. The amount of CDOM was spatially variable in all investigated waterbodies. It was highest in the coastal/onshore areas and in the estuaries of the main rivers. It usually decreased from spring towards autumn, and the seasonal patterns were most distinct in the onshore areas. In standing water bodies, the short-term dynamics of discharges had a more significant effect on CDOM concentration in onshore areas than in offshore areas, where the influence of the discharges became visible over a longer period. The results suggest that in large and shallow water bodies the share of the allochthonous component in the CDOM pool decreases towards offshore areas. The impact of CDOM discharged into the inflowing rivers reaches further from shores if the ratio of the catchment area to the volume of the standing water body (C/V) is larger. The influence of precipitation on CDOM absorption proved to be insignificant.

J	Astoreca, R; Rousseau, V; Lancelot, C				Astoreca, Rosa; Rousseau, Veronique; Lancelot, Christiane			Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Southern North Sea waters: Optical characterization and possible origin	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The variability and origin of the Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) were studied in the Belgian coastal and adjacent areas including offshore waters and the Scheldt estuary, through the parameters: absorption at 375 nm, a(CDOM)(375), and the slope of the absorption curve, S. a(CDOM)(375) varied between 0.20 and 1.31 m(-1) and between 0.97 and 4.30 m(-1) in the marine area and Scheldt estuary, respectively. S fluctuated between 0.0101 and 0.0203 nm(-1) in the marine area and between 0.0167 and 0.0191 nm(-1) in the Scheldt estuary. The comparative analysis Of a(CDOM)(375) and S variations evidenced different origins of CDOM in the BCZ. The Scheldt estuarine waters showed decreasing a(CDOM)(375) values with increasing salinity but constant S value of similar to 0.018 nm(-1) suggesting a dominant terrestrial origin of CDOM. On the contrary, samples collected in the marine domain showed a narrow range of a(CDOM)(375) but highly variable S suggesting the additional presence of autochthonous sources of CDOM. This source was evidenced based on the sorting of the marine offshore data according to the stage of the phyto-plankton bloom when they were collected. A clear distinction was made between CDOM released during the growth stage characterized by high S (similar to 0.017 nm(-1)) and low a(CDOM)(375) and the decay phase characterized by low S (similar to 0.013 nm(-1)) and high a(CDOM)(375). This observation was supported by CDOM measurements performed on pure phytoplankton cultures which showed increased CDOM release along the wax and wane of the bloom but decreasing S. We concluded that the high variability of the CDOM signature in offshore waters is explained by the local biological production and processing of CDOM. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

W.; Stedmon, Colin; Duan, Shuiwang; Louchouarn, Patrick			The use of PARAFAC modeling to trace terrestrial dissolved organic matter and fingerprint water masses in coastal Canadian Arctic surface waters	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were investigated in the Canadian Archipelago and coastal Beaufort Sea surface waters using fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Environmental dynamics of individual components were evaluated and compared to salinity, in situ fluorescence, absorption at 312 nm (a(312)), dissolved organic carbon, and lignin phenol concentrations. A positive linear relationship between four fluorescent components and lignin phenols suggests a terrestrial origin, whereas two components were unrelated to a river source, suggesting an autochthonous source. Elevated concentrations of terrestrial components were observed in the Mackenzie River plume near the coast of Alaska and decreased as water was transported to the Canadian Archipelago. The two nonterrestrial components exhibited only background levels in concentrations along the transect, suggesting minimal productivity within plume and archipelago surface waters. The relative abundance of terrestrial components in relation to nonterrestrial components allowed us to distinguish water masses including Atlantic, Archipelago, and Mackenzie River plume, respectively. This study illustrates the usefulness of PARAFAC to fingerprint water masses based on the optical characteristics of CDOM and shows promise to improve our understanding of upper Arctic Ocean ventilation.

We addressed this lack of knowledge by investigating a peatland in south-west Germany that was partly rewetted 20 years ago. A successfully restored site and a moderately drained site were compared, where the mean groundwater levels were close to the soil surface and around 30 cm below surface, respectively. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at 4 depths were measured over one year. The specific absorbance was measured at 280 nm and the fluorescence spectra were used to describe the aromaticity, and complexity of DOM. The investigations showed that 20 years of peatland restoration was able to create typical peatland conditions. The rewetted site had significantly lower DOC concentrations at different depths compared to the drained site. The specific UV absorbance showed that the rewetted site had a lower level of aromatic DOM structures. The decreasing specific UV absorbance might indicate an increasing contribution of small organic molecules to DOM. It was hypothesized that the decreasing DOC concentrations and the relative enrichment of small, readily degradable organic molecules. reflect the slower decomposition of organic matter after the re-establishment of the water table. Seasonal trends provided substantial evidence for our hypothesis that reduced DOC concentrations were caused by reduced peat decomposition. During summer, the elevated DOC values were accompanied by an increase in DOM aromaticity and complexity. Our results demonstrated a close link between C mineralization and DOC production. We concluded that long-term peatland restoration in the form of the successful re-establishment of the water table might result in reduced peat decomposition and lower DOC concentrations. The restoration of peatlands seems to have a positive impact on C sequestration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Light absorption by phytoplankton, non-algal particles and dissolved organic matter at the Patagonia shelf-break in spring and summer	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Satellite image studies and recent in situ sampling have identified conspicuous phytoplankton blooms during spring and summer along the Patagonia shelf-break front. The magnitudes and spectral characteristics of light absorption by total particulate matter (phytoplankton and detritus) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been determined by spectrophotometry in that region for spring 2006 and late summer 2007 seasons. In spring, phytoplankton absorption was the dominant optical component of light absorption (60-85%), and CDOM showed variable and important contributions in summer (10-90%). However, there was a lack of correlation between phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a concentration or [chl a]) and the non-algal compartment in both periods. A statistically significant difference was found between the two periods with respect to the CDOM spectral shape parameter (S-cdom), with means of 0.015 (spring) and 0.012 nm(-1) (summer). Nonetheless, the mean S-cdm values, which describe the slope of detritus plus CDOM spectra, did not differ between the periods (average of 0.013 nm(-1)). Phytoplankton absorption values in this work showed deviations from mean parameterizations in previous studies, with respect to [chl a], as well as between the two study periods. In spring, despite the microplankton dominance, high specific absorption values and large dispersion were found (a(ph)*(440) = 0.04 +/- 0.03 m(2) mg [chl a](-1)), which could be attributed to an important influence of photo-protector accessory pigments. In summer, deviations from general trends, with values of a(ph)*(440) even higher (0.09 +/- 0.02 m(2) mg [chl a](-1)), were due to the dominance of small cell sizes and also to accessory pigments. These results highlight the difficulty in deriving robust relationships between chlorophyll concentration and phytoplankton absorption coefficients regardless of the season period. The validity of a size parameter (S-f) derived from the absorption spectra has been demonstrated and was shown to describe the size structure of phytoplankton populations, independently of pigment concentration, with mean values of 0.41 in spring and 0.72 in summer. Our results emphasize the need for specific parameterization for the study region and seasonal sampling approach in order to model the inherent optical properties from water reflectance signatures.

Relationships between CDOM and concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nutrients and inorganic carbon in the subthermocline waters of the Pacific reflect the relative influences of water mass ventilation and water-column oxidative remineralization. Apparent in situ oxygen utilization (AOU) accounts for 86% and 61% of variance in CDOM abundance, respectively, in Antarctic Intermediate Water and North Pacific Intermediate Water. In the deep waters of the Pacific below the zone of remineralization, AOU explains 26% of CDOM variability. The AOU-CDOM relationship results from competing biogeochemical and advective processes within the ocean interior. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is not statistically linked to the CDOM or AOU distributions, indicating that the majority of CDOM production occurs during the remineralization of sinking POM and thus potentially provides key information about carbon export. Once formed in the ocean interior, CDOM is relatively stable until it reaches the surface ocean where it is destroyed by solar bleaching. Susceptibility to bleaching confers an additional tracer-like quality for CDOM in water masses with active convection, such as mode waters that appear as subsurface CDOM minima. In the surface ocean, atypically low CDOM abundance highlights a region of unusually extreme oligotrophy: the subtropical South Pacific gyre. For these hyper-oligotrophic waters, the present CDOM observations are consistent with analysis of in situ radiometric observations of light attenuation and reflectance, demonstrating the accuracy of the CDOM spectrophotometric observations. Overall, we illustrate how CDOM abundance in the ocean interior can potentially diagnose rates of thermohaline overturning as they affect regional biogeochemistry and export. We further show how relative surface ocean CDOM abundances are driven in large part by processes occurring in the deep layers of the ocean. This is particularly significant for the interpretation of the global surface distribution of CDOM using satellite remote sensing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Oulehle, F; Hruska, J				Oulehle, Filip; Hruska, Jakub			Rising trends of dissolved organic matter in drinking-water reservoirs as a result of recovery from acidification in the Ore Mts., Czech Republic	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), a common proxy for dissolved organic matter (DOM), was measured at seven drinking-water reservoirs and four streams between 1969 and 2006. Nine of them showed significant DOM increases (median COD change +0.08 mg L-1 yr(-1)). Several potential drivers of these trends were considered, including air temperature, rainfall, land-use and water sulfate concentration. Temperature and precipitation influenced inter-annual variations, but not long-term trends. The long-term DOM increase was significantly associated with declines of acidic deposition, especially sulfur deposition. Surface water sulfate concentrations decreased from a median of 62 mg L-1-27 mg L-1 since 1980. The magnitude of DOM increase was positively correlated with average DOM concentration (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.001). Simultaneously, DOM concentration was positively correlated with the proportion of Histosols within the catchments (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.001). A focus on the direct removal of DOM by water treatment procedures rather than catchment remediation is needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Over 10 months, carbohydrates were observed to have a lower bioelimination degree (45%) and higher rejection degree (79%) than those of proteins (81% and 44%, respectively), which led to a high carbohydrate/protein ratio of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sludge supernatant The batch tests showed that DOM derived from feedwater and bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was eliminated by activated sludge via biosorption and biodegradation. The proteins in bound EPS and feedwater were also found to have much higher biosorption potential (27% and 31%, respectively) than humic substances (11% and 17%, respectively) and carbohydrates (16% and 14%, respectively), indicating that proteins had a high affinity with sludge flocs. The results also showed that carbohydrates and humic substances in bound EPS were more difficult to be eliminated by activated sludge. In addition, the batch tests confirmed that feedwater was mainly composed of readily biodegradable matter, and bound EPS was mainly composed of slowly biodegradable matter. Size exclusion chromatography with continuous organic carbon and UV254 detection (LC-OCD) showed that large-size substances (i.e., carbohydrates and macromolecular proteins) in sludge supernatant might originate from bound EPS, which can be rejected by membranes. The LC-OCD analysis, together with the results obtained from batch tests, suggested bound EPS might be the most important source of DOM in the sludge suspension.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 1	2009	43	23					8821	8826		10.1021/es9019996						WOS:000272038900026	19943652	
J	Zhong, H; Wang, WX				Zhong, Huan; Wang, Wen-Xiong			Controls of Dissolved Organic Matter and Chloride on Mercury Uptake by a Marine Diatom	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The effects of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from different origins (estuarine, coastal, and diatom decomposed) and chloride (CI) on the uptake of inorganic mercury [Hg(II)] and methylated mercury (MeHg) by the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was investigated using radiotracer techniques. We first developed a new method to remove the surface adsorbed mercury and quantified the intracellular mercury uptake by the diatoms. The dominant mercury species (DOC or chloride complexes, based on the mercury speciation phase diagrams) was controlled by the concentrations of DOC and Cl(-), which could explain the effects of DOC and Cl- on mercury uptake. DOC complexes dominated Hg(II)'s speciation and reduced its uptake in most seawater examined. DOC complexes dominated MeHg's speciation only at relatively high DOC levels (>100 AM), but it could affect MeHg uptake even when MeHg-Cl complexes dominated. In a mercury-DOC complex dominated system, both the origin and quantity of DOC greatly influenced mercury uptake by the diatoms. Although DOC generally inhibited the uptake of Hg(II) or MeHg, DOC resulting from diatom decomposition enhanced Hg(II) uptake. Under conditions dominated by chloride complexation, neutral mercury chloride species (HgCl(2) or MeHgCl) may control the uptake.

Adapted DAX-8 fractionation method for dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils: development, calibration with test components and application to contrasting soil solutions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Most methods to fractionate natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) rely on sorption of acidified DOM samples onto XAD-8 or DAX-8 resin. Procedural differences among methods are large and their interpretation is limited because there is a lack of calibration with DOM model molecules. An automated column-based DOM fractionation method was set up for 10-ml DOM samples, dividing DOM into hydrophilic (HPI), hydrophobic acid (HPOA) and hydrophobic neutral (HPON) fractions. Fifteen DOM model components were tested in isolation and in combination. Three reference DOM samples of the International Humic Substances Society were included to facilitate comparison with other methods. Aliphatic low-molecular-weight acids (LMWAs) and carbohydrates were classified as HPI DOM, but some LMWAs showed also a partial HPO character. Aromatic LMWAs and polyphenols partitioned in the HPOA fraction, menadione (quinone) and geraniol (terpenoid) in HPON DOM. Molecules with log K(ow) > 0.5 had negligible HPI fractions. The HPO molecules except geraniol had specific UV absorbance (SUVA, measure for aromaticity) > 3 litres g-1 cm-1 while HPI molecules had SUVA values < 3 litres g-1 cm-1. Distributions of DOM from eight soils ranged from 31 to 72% HPI, 25 to 46% HPOA and 2 to 28% HPON of total dissolved organic carbon. The SUVA of the HPI DOM was consistently smaller compared with the HPOA DOM. The SUVA of the natural DOM samples was not explained statistically by fractionation and the variation coefficient of SUVA among samples was not reduced by fractionation. Hence, fractionation did not reduce the variability in this DOM property, which casts some doubts on the practical role of DOM fractionation in predicting DOM properties.																	1351-0754					DEC	2009	60	6					956	965		10.1111/j.1365-2389.2009.01166.x						WOS:000271780200011

We found significant accumulations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, and UV(260) during the phytoplankton bloom period in 2005, although lower accumulations of DOC and DON and only increases of CDOM fluorescence were observed during the bloom period in 2006. Little or no correlation between DOM and phytoplankton abundance might be due to the composition of DOM, which is a complex mixture of organic materials. The 3D-EEM results revealed that the DOM produced around the phytoplankton bloom period contained tyrosine, tryptophan, and humic-like substances. Our results showed that the occurrence of phytoplankton bloom contributed to the production of DOM in coastal water but the DOM accumulation depended on the type of phytoplankton bloom, the phytoplankton species in particular. From our results, we concluded that phytoplankton have a great role in the dynamics of DOM as a producer in a coastal environment.																	0916-8370					DEC	2009	65	6					835	846								WOS:000271262000008

Uptake of dissolved organic matter by ephyrae of two species of scyphomedusae	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Ephyrae of Aurelia labiata given dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater had higher carbon content than starved ephyrae. DOM-fed ephyrae of Chrysaora colorata did not have significantly higher carbon content than starved ephyrae, although the mean trend was higher. DOM-fed ephyrae of A. labiata developed aberrant morphologies similar to starved ephyrae, and neither starved nor DOM-fed ephyrae of either species developed into medusae. In addition to higher carbon content, there was evidence for DOM utilization by A. labiata shown through uptake of and increased ammonium production after exposure to a fluorescently labeled lysine polymer.																	0142-7873					DEC	2009	31	12					1563	1570		10.1093/plankt/fbp088						WOS:000271576000011

With invigoration of scientific inquiries into the global carbon cycle, our ignorance of its role in ocean biogeochemistry became untenable. Rapid mobilization of relevant research two decades ago required the community to overcome early false leads, but subsequent progress in examining the global dynamics of this material has been steady. Continuous improvements in analytical skill coupled with global ocean hydrographic survey opportunities resulted in the generation of thousands of measurements throughout the major ocean basins. Here, observations and model results provide new insights into the large-scale variability of dissolved organic carbon, its contribution to the biological pump, and its deep ocean sinks.

Sources and transformations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Neponset River Watershed	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The major source of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in coastal waters is often terrestrial dissolved organic matter originating in coastal watersheds and delivered to the ocean by rivers or streams. While studies of carbon cycling in large rivers dominate the literature, small rivers deliver the bulk of the freshwater to coastal waters (similar to 60%). However, the variability of organic matter fluxes in small rivers requires high spatial and temporal resolution measurements to adequately represent the processes controlling distributions and fluxes. In this study, CDOM was measured monthly for 2 years at 15 sampling sites throughout a small, coastal, urban watershed (300 km(2)), the Neponset River Watershed, and CDOM variability was found to depend on land use type, discharge/precipitation, and growing degree days (temperature). Forest, wetland, residential, industrial, and golf course CDOM end-members were measured and differentiated using CDOM fluorescence, CDOM absorbance, absorbance slopes, total organic carbon and total nitrogen, and photo-and biological lability. Simple statistical models of CDOM end-member behavior could explain 40-70% of the observed seasonal variability. Using these simple relationships, trends in total CDOM loading behavior can be predicted under various scenarios of land use change and global warming. Overall, detailed measurements of CDOM throughout the Neponset River Watershed yield new insights into the watershed processes that affect terrestrial CDOM delivery to coastal oceans.

Of the filterable Hg at the headwaters of UEFPC, >90% was present as HgR and this fraction decreased downstream but remained >29% of the filterable Hg at all sites. The presence of higher HgR concentrations than would be predicted under equilibrium conditions in UEFPC and in experiments with a NOM isolate suggests that kinetic reactions are controlling the complexation between Hg and NOM. The slow formation of Hg-NOM complexes is attributed to competitive ligand exchange among various moieties and functional groups in NOM with a range of binding strengths and configurations. This study demonstrates the need to consider the effects of Hg-NOM complexation kinetics on processes such as Hg methylation and solid phase partitioning.

Measuring the Photochemical Production of Carbon Dioxide from Marine Dissolved Organic Matter by Pool Isotope Exchange	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												CO(2) is the major known product of solar photolysis of marine dissolved organic matter(DOM). Measuring the rate of this globally significant process is hindered by low rates per unit volume, high background CO(2) in seawater, and ubiquitous contamination. Current methods Utilize CO(2)-free seawater matrices, possibly introducing artifacts. Alternatively, pool isotope exchange (PIE) replaces most of the sample's DI(12)C with DI(13)C at natural pH and temperature, so that (12)CO(2) from DOM photooxidation elevates (12)CO(2)/(13)CO(2) ratios in irradiated samples compared to dark controls. (12)CO(2)/(13)CO(2) ratios are then measured using a modified GC-IRMS. The minimum detectable concentration change (three standard deviations) is 300 nmol DI(12)C/kg. Methods for minimizing contamination while exchanging, transferring, sealing, and irradiating samples, and for recovering and purifying CO(2) are presented. Results from PIE agree within uncertainties with those from CO(2)-free coastal seawater, suggesting that both methods apply to river-dominated coastal waters. However, photooxidation in the open ocean, which likely dominates the global flux despite lower rates per unit volume, involves DOM that differs from coastal DOM, so that coastal agreement cannot validate open-ocean studies. Major advantages of PIE are use of nearly unperturbed seawater matrices, potential to incubate samples in situ to obtain depth-integrated rates directly, and potential to use larger samples to measure open-ocean waters.																	0013-936X					NOV 15	2009	43	22					8604	8609		10.1021/es901543e						WOS:000271583400025	20028059

Fluorescence-based proxies for lignin in freshwater dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lignin phenols have proven to be powerful biomarkers in environmental studies; however, the complexity of lignin analysis limits the number of samples and thus spatial and temporal resolution in any given study. In contrast, spectrophotometric characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is rapid, noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, requires small sample volumes, and can even be measured in situ to capture fine-scale temporal and spatial detail of DOM cycling. Here we present a series of cross-validated Partial Least Squares models that use fluorescence properties of DOM to explain up to 91% of lignin compositional and concentration variability in samples collected seasonally over 2 years in the Sacramento River/San Joaquin River Delta in California, United States. These models were subsequently used to predict lignin composition and concentration from fluorescence measurements collected during a diurnal study in the San Joaquin River. While modeled lignin composition remained largely unchanged over the diurnal cycle, changes in modeled lignin concentrations were much greater than expected and indicate that the sensitivity of fluorescence-based proxies for lignin may prove invaluable as a tool for selecting the most informative samples for detailed lignin characterization. With adequate calibration, similar models could be used to significantly expand our ability to study sources and processing of DOM in complex surface water systems.

In these samples, concentrations of DOC, dissolved free carbohydrates (DFCHO), dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO), total dissolved carbohydrates (TDCHO) and total dissolved free amino acids (TDFAA) ranged from 141.7 to 191.1 A mu mol C/L, 1.98 to 18.18 A mu mol C/L, 5.04 to 24.90 A mu mol C/L, 14.52 to 30.36 A mu mol C/L, and 1.83 to 11.89 A mu mol C/L, respectively. As a major component of the dissolved carbohydrates, the concentrations of DCCHO were about three times higher than those of DFCHO. Three major constituents of the DFAA were threonine (23.0 +/- 5.7 mol%), glutamic acid (16.6 +/- 3.2 mol%) and arginine (9.1 +/- 3.3 mol%). Based on the composition of DFAA, a molar C:N ratio of 3.60 +/- 0.75 in DFAA was derived, indicating longer carbon chains in the amino acids. DCCHO (8.1%) was the most abundant fraction of DOM in most samples, followed by DFCHO (4.8%) and TDFAA (2.7%). These DOM concentrations displayed a decreasing trend from the coast to the central region. Significant correlations were found between the DCCHO and DFCHO concentrations (r=-0.724, n=19, P < 0.001) and the DCCHO and TDCHO concentrations (r=0.506, n=19, P=0.027).																	0254-4059					NOV	2009	27	4					851	858		10.1007/s00343-009-9020-7						WOS:000272422300021

Simultaneous removal of particles and dissolved organic matter in floating media filter for surface water treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT					2nd Conference on Challenges in Environmental Science and Engineering	JUL 14-17, 2009	Townsville, AUSTRALIA					This research investigated the performance of floating media filter in removing particles and dissolved organic matter from surface water. Pilot-scale study consists of floating plastic media pre-filter connected with either granular activated carbon (GAC) or sponge biological filter (BF) bed. In the floating plastic media filter, coagulation and flocculation processes using poly-aluminum chloride (PACl) as coagulant at an Optimum dose of 8 mg/L helped removing particles from raw water. The floating media filter was operated a filtration rate of 11 m(3)/m(2) h whereas those in GAC and BF units were maintained at 2 m(3)/m(2).h. Continuous operation for over 1.20 days gave 98% and 99% average removal efficiencies of turbidity and UV 254 in floating media filter in combination with GAC unit whereas and 78% and 52% removal efficiencies of turbidity and UV 254 removal were obtained in floating media filter in combination with BE The removal of dissolved organic carbon in GAC and BF units reduced chlorine demand for disinfection by 29% and 14%. It could also reduce the sum of trihalomethane (THMs) ratio from 1.1 to 0.1 and 0.5 respectively.

Effects of land use on dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry in piedmont headwater streams of the Southeastern United States	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and dissolved organic phosphorous (DOP) concentrations over the course of a year in 15 headwater streams within a Georgia Piedmont watershed that is a mosaic of areas with intensive animal agriculture, forestry, and residential development. The watershed receives large non-point-source organic waste inputs, mostly from poultry and beef production, with lesser quantities from the rapidly growing human population. The organic wastes from animal agriculture are deposited on nearby pastures and the human wastes are mostly treated with septic systems. We selected the headwater catchments to fall along a gradient of organic waste inputs, and hypothesized that stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations would increase along this gradient. We used a set of readily obtainable landscape indicators (land use categories, soil carbon content, and soil clay content), factor scores derived from a principal components analysis (PCA) of the landscape indicators, and organic waste input estimates to develop simple empirical models that describe our measured DOM concentrations and elemental ratios (C:N, C:P, and N:P). The models show positive correlations of stream DOC, DON, and DOP concentrations with pasture land cover, and with estimated organic waste inputs, lending support to our hypothesis. Over the entire measurement period, buffer land cover better described mean DOC and DON concentrations [maximum adjusted R(2) (AdjR(2)) of 0.86 and 0.90, respectively] whereas the best models for mean DOP concentration and elemental ratios were comprised of both watershed and buffer scale indicators or PCA factor scores (maximum AdjR(2) ranged from 0.54 to 0.64). Organic waste estimates were also useful DOM descriptors (maximum AdjR(2) ranged from 0.23 to 0.55), although they were less effective than the landscape indicators. Landscape indicators and organic waste estimates were useful descriptors of DOC concentration variation (maximum AdjR(2) ranged from 0.22 to 0.77) after grouping the observations by season. Watershed scale indicators were better descriptors during most of the seasons. We conclude that landscape indicators and organic waste input estimates are useful descriptors of DOM concentrations and elemental ratios in watersheds dominated by non-point-source organic matter inputs.																	0018-8158					NOV	2009	635	1					289	308		10.1007/s10750-009-9921-7						WOS:000270652200026

Litter Contributions to Dissolved Organic Matter and Disinfection Byproduct Precursors in California Oak Woodland Watersheds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Export of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from California oak woodland ecosystems is of a great concern because DOM is a precursor for carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed during drinking water treatment. Fresh litter and decomposed duff materials for the four dominant vegetation components of California oak woodlands: blue oak (Quercus douglassi H. & A.), live oak (Quercus wislizenii A. DC.), foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana Dougl.), and annual grasses, were exposed in natural condition for an entire rainy season (December to May) to evaluate their contributions of particulate (POC) and dissolved (DOC) organic carbon, particulate (PON) and dissolved (DON) organic nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen (NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-)), and trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetonitrile (HAN) formation potentials, to surface waters. Litter and duff materials can be significant sources of DOC (litter = 29-126 mg DOC g(-1) C; duff = 6.5-37 mg DOC g(-1) C) and THMs and HANs (LIP to 4600 mu g-THMs g-C(-1) and 137 mu g-HANs g-C(-1)). Blue oak litter had the highest yield of DOC, THM, and HAN precursors. When scaled to the entire watershed, leachate production yielded 445 kg-DOC ha(-1), as compared to DOC export via streams of 5.25 kg-DOC ha(-1). DOC transport to surface waters is facilitated by subsurface lateral flow through A horizons during storm events. The majority of DOM and DBP precursors was leached from plant materials in the initial rainfall events and thus may explain the seasonal stream pattern of a DOC pulse early in the rainy season.

In medium with full nitrate (880 mu M), the average growth rate was 0.32 +/- 0.01 day(-1) (L1, control without added DOM). Adding natural marine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) at levels of 20-30 mu M above background (10 mu M) led to a higher growth rate (L1+DOM, 0.40 +/- 0.00 day(-1)). In medium with lower nitrate level (175 mu M) and higher DON (L1/5+DOM treatment), both dissolved inorganic nitrogen and DON were used, leading to the highest growth rates (0.43 +/- 0.03 day(-1)). In medium without nitrate [(L1-N)+DOM treatment], the low ammonium concentrations observed throughout the experiment (< 1 mu M) as well as the uptake kinetics of A. catenella could not have supported the observed growth rates, leading us to conclude that DON was directly used by this organism, rather than using N remineralized by bacteria (from DON). The decrease of bacteria in DOM enriched bioassays could point to a nutrient limitation and competition with A. catenella for organic matter. Viruses likely contributed as an additional factor to keep the bacterial population from becoming dominant.

The addition of a carbon source (i.e. glucose) promoted the growth of Gammaproteobacteria, while a combined source of C and N (i.e. leucine) favoured the development of Alphaproteobacteria. The addition of yeast extract, a complex substrate rich in N and growth factors, promoted the proliferation of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Grazing pressure exerted by nanoflagellates produced marked differences on the size structure of the prokaryotic biomass. A pronounced tendency to filamentation and aggregation was observed in the glucose treatment, while in the case of yeast extract, small and mainly freely dispersed prokaryotes were maintained throughout the incubations. Thus, the final community in the yeast extract treatment showed a high percentage of edible biomass, while an important fraction of potentially grazing-resistant prokaryotes (more than 50% of total prokaryotic biomass) was detected in the microcosms enriched with glucose. These results suggest a marked effect of DOM sources on the development of grazing-resistant prokaryotes.

In this study, we experimentally determined the quantity and spectral quality of CDOM generated by bacterioplankton using two different substrates ( with and without photoproducts) and by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and evaluated their potential contributions to CDOM dynamics in the peninsular region of the Southern Ocean. CDOM was generated by bacteria in all experiments, and the presence of photoproducts influenced both the quantity and the spectral quality of the resultant CDOM. We confirmed a direct link between bacterial production and CDOM generation, which yielded in situ CDOM duplication times from 31 to 33 d. Antarctic krill as a direct source of CDOM was also confirmed experimentally. We estimated that CDOM generation by krill would lead to CDOM duplication times from 0.48 to 0.80 d within krill swarms. Our findings highlight the potential significance of bacteria and Antarctic krill swarms in the generation of CDOM and underscore the dynamic nature of CDOM in this area.

A model of degradation and production of three pools of dissolved organic matter in an alpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the transport and production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an alpine lake in the Colorado Front Range during snowmelt and the summer ice-free season by employing a new approach for distinguishing between three pools of DOM based on fractionation and spectroscopic characterization. Reactive transport modeling results confirm that terrestrially derived sources of humic DOM are dominant during snowmelt and that microbially derived humic and nonhumic DOM are produced in the lake in the summer, when rates of primary productivity are highest. DOM characterization and modeling results support the interpretation that losses of terrestrially derived humic DOM are dependent on photochemistry and indicate that the decay of nonhumic and microbially derived humic DOM is more influenced by heterotrophic degradation. Results suggest that production of nonhumic DOM can be directly related to chlorophyll a concentrations and that microbially derived humic DOM can be produced through condensation reactions. Furthermore, fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of DOM suggest that the rate of decay of microbially derived humic DOM decreases as the redox state of quinone-like moieties of the DOM becomes more oxidized. This study quantifies the influence of DOM source on the chemical and biological reactivity of DOM in lakes. The methods presented in this study provide a framework for testing hypotheses related to the effects of a changing climate on lake ecosystem structure and function.

Seasonal variability and controls on chromophoric dissolved organic matter in a large river-dominated coastal margin	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The spring-to-summer seasonal transition in the spatial and vertical distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( CDOM) optical properties was examined during surveys conducted in March, May, July, and August of 2005 in the waters influenced by the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Strong seasonal river influences and a well-correlated inverse relationship between CDOM absorption at 412 nm and salinity during spring of 2005 suggests conservative mixing in the water column between the riverine freshwater sources and the oceanic end members. Trends in the CDOM absorption and the spectral absorption slope ( S) and deviations from the end-member conservative mixing line in surface and bottom waters during the summer suggest apparent sources and sinks of CDOM. Elevated CDOM in lower-salinity surface waters at many stations appears to be linked to high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO; >10 mg L(-1)) and elevated chlorophyll concentrations. Effects of photo-oxidation in surface waters were observed as increasing S and enhanced CDOM loss in the similar to 27-32 salinity range and were attributed to seasonal stratification and the increased solar radiation during the summer. In the bottom waters, elevated CDOM levels in the similar to 32-36 salinity range were associated with low DO and relatively higher bacterial abundance; this suggests a potential CDOM source due to microbial remineralization of organic matter in the hypoxic zone in bottom waters. Seasonal dynamics associated with CDOM loss in surface waters and CDOM gains in bottom waters may be another pathway influencing hypoxia in coastal waters.

Boron Transport in Soils as affected by Dissolved Organic Matter in Treated Sewage Effluent	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Interaction of effluent dissolved organic matter (DOM) with native soil organic matter (OM), B complexation with DOM, and adsorption of B by soil all play an important role in assessing B transport in soil. However, no information is available yet on the impact of these reactions on B mobility in soil. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of B-DOM complexation on B mobility in soils irrigated with treated effluents. Sod column displacement experiments were conducted to measure the B mobility in the presence of DOM extracted from municipal treated sewage plants. To describe B transport in the presence of DOM, a traditional multicomponent transport model was used. The model took into account the B-DOM-soil reactions (obtained from batch experiments). It was observed that the presence of OM molecules in soil solution enhanced B transport in sod due to B-OM complexation. The concentration of this complex in soil solution increases with the concentration of the dissolved OM (from both effluent and native soil). The model simulated well the effect of DOM on B transport in soil.

J	Keren, R; Communar, G				Keren, R.; Communar, G.			Boron Sorption on Wastewater Dissolved Organic Matter: pH Effect	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Although it is well known that B interacts with organic matter, no information is available yet on B adsorption by dissolved organic matter (DOM) from treated sewage effluent. This study aimed to determine the effect of pH on B adsorption by DOM in sewage effluent, and to develop a B adsorption model for DOM as a function of pH. The DOM used in this study was separated from effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The B adsorption isotherms for the DOM were determined at various pH levels ranging from 5.1 to 10.9. Boron adsorption by DOM increased significantly as the pH increased from 5.8 to 9.25, and maximized at pH 9.3. The B adsorption values at any given constant pH, as calculated by using the Langmuir adsorption equation fitted every single adsorption isotherm well, but the adsorption parameters k(B)-DOM and b(mDOM) were both pH dependent. The competitive adsorption model simulated well B adsorption by DOM only at the high pH range, but failed at the lower range. The deviation between the predicted values and the experimental data in the low pH range is probably due to changes in DOM structure and acidic functional groups content. Good agreement between calculated and experimental results at the lower pH range was obtained by introducing a correction factor in the competitive adsorption model to account for these changes.																	0361-5995					NOV-DEC	2009	73	6					2021	2025		10.2136/sssaj2008.0381						WOS:000271752700032

Changes in dissolved organic matter with depth suggest the potential for postharvest organic matter retention to increase subsurface soil carbon pools	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Research into postharvest management of forests often focuses on balancing the need for increased biomass yield against factors that may directly impact the productivity of the subsequent stand (e.g. nutrient and water availability, soil microclimate, etc.). Postharvest organic matter management, however, also exerts a strong influence over the translocation of carbon (C) into and through the soil profile and may provide a mechanism to increase soil C content. The effects of contrasting postharvest organic matter retention treatments (bole-only removal, BO; whole-tree removal, WT) on soil solution C concentration and quality were quantified at the Fall River and Matlock Long-term Soil Productivity (LTSP) studies in Washington state. Solutions were collected monthly at depths of 20 and 100 cm and analyzed for dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and DOC: DON ratio. Comparisons of DOC concentrations with depth illustrate divergent trends between the two treatments, with an overall decrease in DOC with depth in the BO treatment and either an increase or no change with depth in the WT treatment. Trends in DON concentrations with depth were less clear, partly due to the very low concentrations observed, although the relationship of DOC:DON with depth shows a decrease in the BO treatment and little to no change in DOC quality in the WT treatment. This illustrates that more recalcitrant organic matter (higher DOC:DON) is being removed from solution as it moves through the soil profile. Only 35-40% of the DOC moving past 20 cm in the BO treatment is present at 100 cm. Conversely, 98-117% of the DOC at 20 cm in the WT treatment is present at 100 cm. Thus, 11 and 30 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) are removed from solution between 20 and 100 cm in the BO treatment at the Matlock and Fall River LTSP studies, respectively. Although much of this C is often assumed to be utilized for microbial respiration, DOC:DON ratios of the potential organic substrates and the unique mineralogy of the soils of this region suggest that a significant portion may in fact be incorporated into a more recalcitrant soil C pool. Thus, postharvest organic matter retention may provide a mechanism to increase soil C sequestration on these soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kim, HC; Lee, K				Kim, Hyun-Cheol; Lee, Kitack			Significant contribution of dissolved organic matter to seawater alkalinity	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The present study shows a previously undocumented role of dissolved organic matter in the marine carbonate system. During photosynthesis, phytoplankton release dissolved organic compounds containing basic functional groups that readily react with protons during seawater titration, and thereby contribute to alkalinity (a measure of buffering capacity). The magnitude of the contribution of dissolved organic compounds to seawater alkalinity is species dependent, suggesting that individual phytoplankton species exude dissolved organic compounds with unique proton accepting capacities. Our study shows that dissolved organic matter produced by marine phytoplankton during photosynthesis is a newly identified buffering component in the ocean, and indicates that the contribution of dissolved organic matter to seawater alkalinity can be significant in the biologically productive upper ocean, where to date it has been unrecognized or considered insignificant.

Characterizing chlorine oxidation of dissolved organic matter and disinfection by-product formation with fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Relationships between chlorine demand and disinfection by-product (DBP) formation during chlorination and fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were developed. Fluorescence excitation and emission (EEM) spectroscopy was employed, and parameters including fluorescence index, redox index, and overall fluorescence intensity (OFI) were correlated to chlorine demand and DBP formation. The EEMs were also analyzed using a well established global parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model which resolves the fluorescence signal into 13 components, including quinone-like and protein-like components. Over an 8-day chlorination period the OFI and sum of the 13 PARAFAC loadings decreased by more than 70%. The remaining identified quinone-like compounds within the DOM were shifted to a more oxidized state. Quinone fluorescence was strongly correlated to both reduced fluorescence intensity and to chlorine demand which indicates that fluorescence may be used to track the chlorine oxidation of DOM. Quinone fluorescence was also correlated strongly with both classes of regulated DBPs: total trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Quinone-like components were found to be strongly correlated to overall, short-term, and long-term specific DBP formation. The results of this study show that fluorescence is a useful tool in tracking both DOM oxidation and DBP formation during chlorination. Citation: Beggs, K. M. H., R. S. Summers, and D. M.

Automation in this regard can optimize the minimal-needed injection volume and the solvent consumption will be efficiently reduced. A new fully automated sample desalting and pre-concentration technique employing microextraction by packed sorbents (MEPS) cartridges is implemented and coupled to an ion cyclotron resonance Fourier-transform mass spectrometer (ICR-FT/MS). The performance of non-target mass spectrometric analysis is compared for the automated versus off-line sample preparation for several samples of aqueous natural organic matter. This approach can be generalized for any metabolite profiling or metabolome analysis of biological materials but was optimized herein using a well characterized but highly complex organic mixture: a surface water and its well-characterized natural organic matter and a marine sample having a highly salt charge and enabling to validate the presented automatic system for salty samples. The analysis of Suwannee River water showed selective C18-MEPS enrichment of chemical signatures with average H/C and O/C elemental ratios and loss of both highly polar and highly aromatic structures from the original sample. Automated on-line application to marine samples showed desalting and different chemical signatures from surface to bottom water. Relative comparison of structural footprints with the C18-concentration/desalting procedure however enabled to demonstrate that the surface water film was more concentrated in surface-active components of natural (fatty acids) and anthropogenic origin (sulfur-containing surfactants). Overall, the relative standard deviation distribution in terms of peak intensity was improved by automating the proposed on-line method.

J	Park, JH				Park, Ji-Hyung			Spectroscopic characterization of dissolved organic matter and its interactions with metals in surface waters using size exclusion chromatography	CHEMOSPHERE												HPLC-size exclusion chromatography (SEC), coupled with on-line detection of UV absorbance (UVA) and fluorescence, was used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its interactions with dissolved metals in a forest stream, a reservoir, and an urban river. Optimization of eluent concentration (20 mM) allowed separation of altogether 11 molecular size (MS) fractions when NaClO(4) was used as an eluent having minimal disturbance with metals. UVA at 254 nm and fulvic-like fluorescence (FFL) at 337/423 (excitation/emission) nm were detected for 'humic' fractions, while protein-like fluorescence (PFL) at 278/353 nm was detected across the whole MS range. At all sites temporal variations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were well explained by changes in UVA intensity of humic fractions, while PFL intensities of a small MS fraction showed a higher correlation with DOC concentrations at the reservoir. Temporal changes in the concentrations of Al, Cr, Li, Ni, and Fe correlated with PFL intensities of small MS fractions, while variations in the concentrations of As, Co, Mn, and Pb were largely explained by UVA and PFL intensities of humic fractions. The results suggest that HPLC-SEC combined with on-line detection of UVA and PFL can be efficiently used in characterizing DOM and its interactions with metals in surface waters.

Dissolved Organic Matter Enhances Transport of PAHs to Aquatic Organisms	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In this study, the uptake of pyrene and benzo[b]fluoranthene by an aquatic worm (Lumbriculus variegatus) and a poly(dimethylsiloxane) coated glass fiber was studied at different humic acid concentrations. The accumulation of pyrene was not affected by the presence of the humic matrix. However, the accumulation rate of benzo[b]fluoranthene increased a factor of 3 for the fiber and a factor of 4 when 55 mg L-1 dissolved organic carbon was added in the form of humic acid. The difference between the two chemicals can be explained by the higher affinity of benzo[b]fluoranthene for the dissolved humic material. A comparison of modeled transport enhancement of benzo[b]fluoranthene by humic acid and the experimental results suggested that the benzo[b]fluoranthene complexed with the humic phase was not completely labile.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 1	2009	43	19					7212	7217		10.1021/es803684f						WOS:000270136500012	19848124	
J	Cooney, TJ; Simon, KS				Cooney, Timothy J.; Simon, Kevin S.			Influence of Dissolved Organic Matter and Invertebrates on the Function of Microbial Films in Groundwater	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Microbial films play a central role in mediating energy flux in groundwater ecosystems. The activity of these microbes is likely to be influenced by the availability of resources, especially dissolved organic matter (DOM), and also by consumers, such as invertebrates that feed on microbial films. We used microcosm experiments to examine how bacterial production and extracellular enzyme activity on rocks and fine sediments from cave streams responded to amendments of DOM of varying form and to cave amphipods (Gammarus minus) that feed on microbial films. Glucose and mixtures of DOM extracted from soils and leaves stimulated bacterial production on rocks by 89-166% relative to unamended controls. In contrast, tannic acid amendment did not influence production. Microbial films on fine sediment were not consistently responsive to DOM amendment. Glucose amendment led to increased activity of enzymes associated with C acquisition, but other forms of DOM generally did not alter enzyme activity. DOM amendment led to removal of nitrate and this was correlated with bacterial production, suggesting microbes can link carbon and nitrogen cycling in groundwater as is the case in surface systems. Amphipods reduced bacterial production on rocks, but not fine sediments. The reduction caused by amphipods offset the stimulatory effect of glucose amendment, but there was no interactive effect of DOM and grazing on bacterial production or enzyme activity. Both resources and consumers play important roles in regulating microbial activity in groundwater with important implications for higher trophic levels that use microbes for food.																	0095-3628					OCT	2009	58	3					599	610		10.1007/s00248-009-9523-y						WOS:000269928300016	19444497	
J	Zhang, YL; van Dijk, MA; Liu, ML; Zhu, GW; Qin, BQ				Zhang, Yunlin; van Dijk, Mark A.; Liu, Mingliang; Zhu, Guangwei; Qin, Boqiang			The contribution of phytoplankton degradation to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in eutrophic shallow lakes: Field and experimental evidence	WATER RESEARCH												Eight field campaigns in the eutrophic, shallow, Lake Taihu in the summers from 2005 to 2007, and a phytoplankton degradation experiment of 33 days, were carried out to determine the contribution of phytoplankton degradation to CDOM. Significant and positive correlations were found between the CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm [a(CDOM)(355)], normalized fluorescence emission (QSU) at 450 nm from excitation at 355 nm [F(n)(355)], and the chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration for all eight field campaigns, which indicates that the decomposition and degradation of phytoplankton is an important source of CDOM. In the degradation experiment, the CDOM absorption coefficient increased as phytoplankton broke down during the first 12 days, showing the production of CDOM from phytoplankton. After 12 days, a(CDOM)(355) had increased from the initial value 0.41 +/- 0.03 m(-1) to 1.37 +/- 0.03 m(-1) (a 234% increase), and the Chla concentration decreased from the initial value of 349.1 +/- 11.2 mu g/L to 30.4 +/- 13.2 mu g/L (a 91.3% decrease). The mean daily production rate of CDOM from phytoplankton was 0.08 m(-1) for a(CDOM) (355). Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was used to assess CDOM composition from EEM spectra, and four components were identified: a terrestrial-like humic component, two marine-like humic components, and a protein-like component. The rapid increase in marine-like humic fluorophores (C3 and C4) during the degradation experiment suggests that in situ production of CDOM plays an important role in the dynamics of CDOM. The field campaigns and experimental data in the present study show that phytoplankton can be one of the important CDOM producers in eutrophic shallow lakes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Since dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the secondary effluent contains a high concentration of trihalomethanes (THMs) precursors, several processes of advanced treatments including granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, sand column biodegradation, horizontal subsurface flow wetland (HSFW) treatment, laboratory-scale soil aquifer treatment (SAT) and GAC + SAT were used in this study to compare and differentiate the removal mechanisms of DOM. DOM in the secondary effluent and the treated effluents was fractionated into five classes using XAD resins: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N), and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). Results showed that HPO-A and HPI were two main fractions of the DOM in the secondary effluent, accounting for 30.0% and 45.5% of the bulk DOM, respectively. HPO-A exhibited higher trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) and specific THMFP (STHMFP) than HPI during the chlorination process. The order of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal with respect to different advanced treatments was observed to be GAC + SAT > SAT > GAC > sand column > HSFW. As for the DOM removal mechanisms, the advanced treatment processes of GAC adsorption, SAT and GAC + SAT tended to adsorb more HPO-A, HPO-N and TPI-A and could reduce the aromaticity of those DOM fractions efficiently. Correspondingly, the advanced treatment processes of sand column, SAT, HSFW and GAC + SAT removed more HPI and TPI-N through biodegradation and each of the DOM fractions had an increased aromaticity. The removal order of the THMs precursor by the advanced treatment processes was GAC + SAT > GAC > SAT > sand column > HSFW. The adsorption reduced the STHMFP of the DOM fractions effectively, whereas the biodegradation mechanism of the treatments (sand column, SAT, GAC + SAT and HSFW) showed a converse trend. Moreover, the THMFP and STHMFP of the DOM in the HSFW effluent were obviously affected by the DOM derived from the leaves and roots. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we have examined the effect of DOM of (feel) seawater (DSW) from Pacific Ocean oil platelet aggregation and atherosclerosis progression. DSW was passed through a series of filters and then through an Octadecyl Cl 8 filter: the retained substance In ethanol was designated as C18 extractable DOM (C18-DOM). Our studies showed that C18-DOM treatment inhibited platelet aggregation, P-selectin expression and activity of COX-1 significantly. C18-DOM increased the expression of anti-atherogenic molecule namely heme oxygenase-1 in endothelial cells and all these data showed that C18-DOM is exhibiting aspirin-like effects. Moreover our in vivo studies showed that C18-DOM feeding slowed remarkably the progression of atherosclerosis. Our study demonstrated a novel biological effect of oceanic DOM, which has several important implications, including a possible therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis.

We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal temperate watersheds.																	0168-2563					SEP	2009	95	2-3					277	293		10.1007/s10533-009-9336-6						WOS:000269837900007

In this work, we employed three-dimensional EEMS to characterize the compositions of DOM leached by simulated acid rain from red soil. The red soil was subjected to leaching of simulated acid rain of different acidity, and the leached DOM presented five main peaks in its EEMS: peak-A, related to humic acid-like (HA-like) material, at Ex/Em of 310-330/395-420 nm; peak-B, related to UV fulvic acid-like (FA-like) material, at Ex/Em of 230-280/400-435 nm: peak-C and peak-D, both related to microbial byproduct-like material, at Ex/Em of 250-280/335-355 nm and 260-280/290-320 nm, respectively; and peak-E, related to simple aromatic proteins, at Ex/Em of 210-240/290-340 nm. EEMS analysis results indicated that most DOM could be lost from red soil in the early phase of acid rain leaching. In addition to the effects of the pH of acid rain, the loss of DOM also depended on the properties of its compositions and the solubility of their complexes with aluminum. HA-like and microbial byproduct-like materials could be more easily released from red soil by acid rain at both higher pH (4.5 and 5.6) and lower pH (2.5 and 3) than that at middle pH (3.5). On the contrary, FA-like material lost in a similar manner under the action of different acid rains with pH ranging from 2.5 to 5.6. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The characteristics of the EEM from DOM in the Reservoir, f(450/500) and r(C/D) are discussed with the water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon, oxidation reduction potential pH, etc. The focus is the sources, compositions, distributions, environmental behavior of the DOM that mainly composed of fulvic-like, humic-like and protein-like in each sampling sites of the Yangtze mainstream and its two branches. According to the experimental data, fulvic-like and protein-like are dominated in the mainstream, Jialin River mainly consists of protein-like and fulvic-like, which they have higher fluorescence intensity than any other sites, but humic-like enhanced and protein-like decreased after confluence of Jialin River and Yangtze in Chaotianmen. The intensity of fulvic-like is dominant in DOM of the Wu River, while joined the Yangtze River, the intensity of fulvic-like and protein-like is enhanced; the Jialin River for the upper stream and terrestrial source for the mainstream influence the DOM of the TGRA. The fit results reveal the partly linear correlation of the EEM features and characteristics of DOM with the parameters of water qualities, which could be an index and reference for the water monitor and evaluation.																	0253-3820					SEP	2009	37	9					1328	1332								WOS:000270400500015		
J	Fagerberg, T; Carlsson, P; Lundgren, M				Fagerberg, Tony; Carlsson, Per; Lundgren, Mikael			A large molecular size fraction of riverine high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW DOM) stimulates growth of the harmful dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum	HARMFUL ALGAE												An increase in the concentration of riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been observed during the last decades, and this material can stimulate marine plankton in coastal waters with significant freshwater input. We studied the effect of two size fractions of riverine high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW DOM), isolated with tangential ultrafiltration, on the harmful dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum and a natural isolate of marine bacteria under laboratory conditions. Both A. minutum and bacteria grew significantly better with the low MW DOM compared to both the high MW DOM fraction and controls (no DOM additions). This experiment demonstrates that the harmful algae A. minutum and bacteria benefit from larger molecules of river HMW DOM, and highlights the potential of A. minutum to utilize organic nitrogen from large DOM molecules. This ability may enhance their likelihood of success in estuaries/costal waters with a humic rich freshwater input, especially when the relative amount of large molecules within DOM is more pronounced.

When normalized to the unit surface area, the production rates of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON, respectively) were 37 and 4.4 nmol cm(-2) h(-1), respectively. Comparing with the photosynthetic rate by zooxanthellae, which was measured by (13)C-tracer accumulation in the soft tissue of the coral colony, the release rate of DOC corresponded to 5.4% of the daily net photosynthetic production. The tissue biomass of the coral colony was 178 mu mol C cm(-2) and 23 mu mol N cm(-2), indicating that the release of DOC and DON accounted for 0.021% h(-1) and 0.019% h(-1) of the tissue C and N, respectively. The C:N ratios of the released DOM (average 8.4) were not significantly different from those of the soft tissue of the coral colonies (average 7.7). While DFAA did almost not accumulate in the incubated seawater, DCAA was considerably released by the coral colonies at the rate of 2.1 nmol cm(-2) h(-1) on average. Calculating C and N contents of the hydrolyzable DCAA, it was revealed that about 20% and 50%-60% of the released bulk DOC and DON, respectively, were composed of DCAA. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Dissolved organic matter from elevated-CO2 detritus and its impact on the orientation of crayfish (Orconectes virilis) to a fish food source	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Crayfish must locate food resources in a chemically complex environment in which chemicals from various sources interact and mix. We tested the hypothesis that an additional chemical food source of leachate from detritus (dissolved organic matter [DOM]) would affect crayfish orientation behavior toward a fish stimulus. In addition, we predicted that the effect of DOM would differ depending on whether the detritus was produced under ambient (AMB) or elevated (ELEV) CO2 because of changes in foliar chemistry that accompany elevated CO2 levels. DOM was collected from leaf litter derived from quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) foliage that was produced at either AMB or ELEV CO2 and was presented at 2 concentrations (3 mg/L, 6 mg/L). Stimulus treatments were: 1) CON (control; fish odor only), 2) AMB-low (fish + AMB DOM at 3 mg/L), 3) AMB-high (fish + AMB DOM at 6 mg/L), 4) ELEV-low (fish + ELEV DOM at 3 mg/L), and 5) ELEV-high (fish + ELEV DOM at 6 mg/L). Crayfish (Orconectes virilis) were observed in a recirculating flume in which the fish odor source was placed downstream of the DOM odor source. Behavioral responses measured were % success in locating the fish odor source, time to find source, walking speed, walking speed toward the source, turning angle, heading angle relative to the source, heading angle relative to upstream, and net-to-gross ratio (NCR). Crayfish in the AMB-high treatment were most successful in locating the source. Animals had higher turning angles in the ELEV-high treatment than in all treatments except the control and had increased heading angles relative to the source and decreased heading angles relative to upstream. No differences were found for walking speed or NCR. These results indicate that crayfish orientation to a fish odor source is affected by the presence of DOM from detritus, but only when it is presented at the high end of a natural range of DOM concentration. It also appears that the presence of ambient CO2 detritus (with a lower concentration of secondary defensive compounds) increases success in finding the source, whereas the presence of elevated CO2 detritus does not. Possibly, in an elevated-CO2 future, behaviors associated with foraging and selection of food types by crayfish might be altered, and therefore affect the aquatic community. These effects might be seasonal and synchronized with the natural fluctuations of DOM found in lotic systems.																	0887-3593					SEP	2009	28	3					638	648		10.1899/09-018.1						WOS:000273885900010

Diurnal variations in dissolved organic matter and ammonium uptake in six open-canopy streams	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Daily fluctuations of primary production can result in diurnal variations in labile dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON) concentrations, but we know little about how biotic uptake of labile DOC and DON changes from day to night. We compared daytime vs nighttime uptake of ammonium (NH(4)(+)), acetate (labile DOC), and glycine (labile DON) using short-term nutrient releases conducted in 6 open-canopy streams in northwestern Wyoming, USA. NH(4)(+) uptake was primarily a function of autotrophic demand because it was often higher during the day, and daytime uptake was driven by gross primary production when placed in context of prior data from the region (r(2) = 0.60, p < 0.001). However, acetate uptake showed no significant diurnal change and the quality of fine benthic organic matter explained diurnal variation in uptake across streams, indicating control via heterotrophic demand (r(2) = 0.94, p = 0.006). Patterns in glycine uptake were distinct from both NH(4)(+) and acetate uptake. Glycine uptake decreased as the ratio of total dissolved N to soluble reactive P increased (r(2) = 0.72, p = 0.002), indicating that DON uptake might be P-limited. Uptake did not differ significantly by solute type, suggesting labile forms of DOC and DON can be cycled as rapidly as NH(4)(+), a solute traditionally considered to be extremely bioreactive in headwater streams. Thus, demand for labile DOC and DON was high despite the fact that bulk DOC and DON concentrations were high relative to inorganic N. This result suggests that ambient availability of labile organic nutrients might not satisfy demand. Last, diurnal variation in NH(4)(+), DOC, and DON demand was as high as annual variation in some forested streams; therefore, future stream nutrient uptake studies should be consider how and when uptake is measured, particularly in streams with open canopies.																	0887-3593					SEP	2009	28	3					694	708		10.1899/08-107.1						WOS:000273885900015

Dissolved Fe concentrations ([D-Fe], <0.22-mu m fraction) in the deep water column were one-half lower in the central region (0.3-0.6 nM) than the western region (0.5-1.2 nM) although the Fe(III) solubility ([Fe(III)sol], <0.025-mu m fraction) levels and distributions in deep waters were almost the same between both regions with middepth maxima (similar to 0.6 nM) at 500-1500-m depth range and then a gradual decrease to similar to 0.3 nM at 5000-m depth. Higher [D-Fe] than [Fe(III)sol] in the deep water column of the western region results from the higher production of dissolved Fe from the decomposition of sinking particulate organic matter in the western region than the central region because of the high atmospheric and/or lateral Fe inputs in the western region. Similarity between [D-Fe] level and [Fe(III)sol] value at each deep water depth in the central region may be attributed to [D-Fe] being nearly in the solubility equilibrium with Fe(III) hydroxide in seawater. Strong linear correlation between [D-Fe] and H-flu intensity in the central region and relatively similar linear relationships between [Fe(III)sol] and H-flu intensity in the western and central regions are the first confirmation that humic-type fluorescent dissolved organic matter may be responsible for [D-Fe] in the deep water column as natural organic ligands complexing with Fe(III).

Tropical riverine DOM receives greater exposure to solar radiation, particularly in large river plumes discharging directly into the open ocean. Initial Congo River DOM exhibited dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and compositional characteristics typical of organic rich blackwater systems. During a 57 day irradiation experiment, Congo River DOM was shown to be highly photoreactive with a decrease in DOC, chromophoric DOM (CDOM), lignin phenol concentrations (Sigma(8)) and carbon-normalized yields (Lambda(8)), equivalent to losses of similar to 45, 85-95, >95 and >95% of initial values, respectively, and a +3.1 parts per thousand enrichment of the delta(13)C-DOC signature. The loss of Lambda(8) and enrichment of delta(13)C-DOC during irradiation was strongly correlated (r = 0.99, p < 0.01) indicating tight coupling between these biomarkers. Furthermore, the loss of CDOM absorbance was correlated to the loss of Lambda(8) (e.g., a(355) versus Lambda(8); r = 0.98, p < 0.01) and delta(13)C-DOC (e.g., a(355) versus delta(13)C; r = 0.97, p < 0.01), highlighting the potential of CDOM absorbance measurements for delineating the photochemical degradation of lignin and thus terrigenous DOM. It is apparent that these commonly used measurements for examination of terrigenous DOM in the oceans have a higher rate of photochemical decay than the bulk DOC pool. Further process-based studies are required to determine the selective removal rates of these biomarkers for advancement of our understanding of the fate of this material in the ocean.

Conductivity-temperature-density profiles and bottle samples collected for salinity, oxygen isotope (delta(18)O), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) analyses were used to discriminate between contributions of river water (RW) and sea-ice melt (SIM). Stations had a fresh summer surface mixed layer 5-25 m thick overlying a cold subsurface layer indicative of the previous winter's polar mixed layer (PML). The fraction of RW decreased strongly with distance from shore, while the opposite was true for SIM. The majority of RW was constrained in a coastal domain within 100-150 km from shore, which, because of high alongshore velocities, accounts for the majority of freshwater and volume transports. On the basis of freshwater inventories and composition, brine and RW accumulate in the PML over winter because of ice formation and downward mixing. The summer surface circulation results in an annual net export of SIM from the region. Residence times for freshwater components in the southwestern sector of the bay, based on currents derived from a 3-D ocean model for Hudson Bay, are about 1-10 months, implying rapid transit of freshwater. Despite the short residence time for RW (1-3 months), CDOM is significantly photobleached and provides an unreliable tracer for RW. Photobleaching represents an important sink for dissolved organic carbon entering from rivers and could, in part, explain why Hudson Bay is only a minor sink for atmospheric CO(2) in the open water season.

The subsequent breakdown of CDOM was also measured by exposing collected CDOM samples to light and dark conditions for over two weeks. CDOM absorption properties were compared at a fixed wavelength of 440 nm and across two integrated wave - bands; UV-A (400-315 nm) and UV-B (315-280 nm). Absorption spectra of macroalgal CDOM samples were typically characterized by peaks and shoulders in the UV bands, features which were species specific. The spectral slope, derived using the log-linear method, proved to be very specific to the species and to the effect of light. Slope measurements ranged from 0.010 to 0.027 nm(-1), in the range of normal seawater values. Significantly more CDOM was produced by algae which were illuminated, providing evidence for alight driven exudation mechanism. Averaged across all species, exudation in the dark accounted for 63.7% of that in the light in the UV-B band. Interspecific differences in exudation rate encompassed an order of magnitude, with the highest absorption measurements attributable to brown algae. However, some brown algae produced considerably less CDOM (e.g. Pelvetia canaliculata), which were more comparable to the green and red species. Over an exposure time of 16 days, significant photochemical degradation of CDOM was observed using a natural summer sunlight regime, showing that natural solar radiation could be an important removal mechanism for newly produced algal CDOM. Though the most obvious effect was a decrease in absorption, photo-bleaching also caused a significant increase in the spectral slope parameter of 0.004 nm(-1). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To do this, we built a 10-component model using 307 EEMs collected from southeast Alaskan soil and streamwater. All 307 EEMs were then fit to the existing model (CM) presented in Cory and McKnight (Environ. Sci. Technol, 2005, 39, 8142-8149), The first approach for evaluating whether the EEMs were fit well to the CM model was an evaluation of the residual EEMs, and we found 22 EEMs were fit poorly by the CM model. Our second measure for verifying whether EEMs were fit well to the CM model was a comparison of correlations between the percent contribution of PARAFAC components and DOM measurements (e.g., dissolved nutrient concentrations), and we found no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the two models. These results support the approach of fitting EEMs to an existing model when DOM is collected from similar environments, which can potentially reduce some of the problems when building an original PARAFAC model. However, it is important to recognize that some of the sensitivity or ecological interpretative power may be lost when fitting EEMs to an existing model.

Biochemical properties and biodegradation of dissolved organic matter from soils	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												Various biologically mediated processes are involved in the turnover of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil; however, relatively little is known about the dynamics of either the microbial community or the individual classes of organic molecules during the decomposition of DOM. We examined the net loss of DOC, the mineralisation of C to CO(2) and the degradation of DOC from six different soils by soil microorganisms. We also quantified the changes in the concentrations of protein, carbohydrate and amino acid C during microbial biodegradation. Over a 70-day incubation period at 20A degrees C, the mineralisation of DOC to CO(2) was described by a double exponential model with a labile pool (half-life, 3-8 days) and a stable pool (half-life, 0.4-6 years). However, in nearly all cases, the mass loss of DOC exceeded the C released as CO(2) with significant deviations from the double exponential model. Comparison of mass DOC loss, CO(2) production and microbial cell counts, determined by epifluorescence microscopy, showed that a proportion of the lost DOC mass could be accounted for by microbial assimilation. Carbohydrate and protein C concentrations fluctuated throughout the incubation with a net change of between 3 to 13 and -30 to 22.4% initial DOC, respectively. No amino acid C was detected during the incubation period (level of detection, 0.01 mg C l(-1)).

The fluorescence. properties of different molecular weights of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were measured by excitation-emission matrix spectra. Protein-like and humic-like fluorophores were observed in the DOM produced by P. donghaiense. The central positions of protein-like fluorophores showed a red shift with prolonged growth duration, shifting from tyrosine-like properties at the exponential growth stage to tryptophan-like properties at the stationary and decline stages. The excitation wavelengths of protein-like fluorophores exhibited some change in the exponential growth and stationary stages with increased molecular size, but showed little change in the decline stage. However, the emission wavelengths in the decline stage exhibited a blue shift. Very distinct C type and A type peaks in humic-like fluorophores were observed. With a prolonged culture time, the intensities of both of the peaks became strong and the excitation wavelengths of peak A showed a red shift, while the A:C ratios fell. More than 94% of fluorescent DOM was in the lower than 1 kDa molecular weight fraction.																	0254-4059					AUG	2009	27	3					564	569		10.1007/s00343-009-9141-z						WOS:000270742000020

Uptake of Allochthonous Dissolved Organic Matter from Soil and Salmon in Coastal Temperate Rainforest Streams	ECOSYSTEMS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important component of aquatic food webs. We compare the uptake kinetics for NH(4)-N and different fractions of DOM during soil and salmon leachate additions by evaluating the uptake of organic forms of carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), and proteinaceous DOM, as measured by parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of DOM fluorescence. Seasonal DOM slug additions were conducted in three headwater streams draining a bog, forested wetland, and upland forest using DOM collected by leaching watershed soils. We also used DOM collected from bog soil and salmon carcasses to perform additions in the upland forest stream. DOC uptake velocity ranged from 0.010 to 0.063 mm s(-1) and DON uptake velocity ranged from 0.015 to 0.086 mm s(-1), which provides evidence for the whole-stream uptake of allochthonous DOM. These findings imply that wetlands could potentially be an important source of DOM to support stream heterotrophic production. There was no significant difference in the uptake of DOC and DON across the soil leachate additions (P > 0.05), although differential uptake of DOM fractions was observed as protein-like fluorescence was removed from the water column more efficiently than bulk DOC and DON (P < 0.05). Moreover, PARAFAC analysis of DOM fluorescence showed that protein-like fluorescence decreased downstream during all DOM additions, whereas humic-like fluorescence did not change. This differential processing in added DOM suggests slow and fast turnover pools exist for aquatic DOM. Taken together, our findings argue that DON could potentially fill a larger role in satisfying biotic N demand in oligotrophic headwater streams than previously thought.																	1432-9840					AUG	2009	12	5					747	759		10.1007/s10021-009-9254-4						WOS:000268492000004

INFLUENCE OF pH, HARDNESS, DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATION, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER SOURCE ON THE ACUTE TOXICITY OF COPPER TO DAPHNIA MAGNA IN SOFT WATERS: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BIOTIC LIGAND MODEL	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The influence of pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, water hardness, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) source on the acute toxicity of copper were investigated with standardized 48-h Daphnia magna toxicity tests. Toxicity tests were conducted according to a four-factor complete factorial design. Nominal factor levels were as follows: pH 6 and 8; DOC, 2.5 and 10 mg/L; hardness, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L as CaCO(3); and two DOM sources (collected from the Black River and Edisto River, SC, USA). The experimental design resulted in 24 different factor level combinations. Results indicated that all factors had significant effects on copper toxicity. Furthermore, a strong interactive effect of DOC concentration and pH was detected. Because the biotic ligand model (BLM) has become a widely used tool for predicting toxicity and interpreting toxicity test results, its performance with these data was evaluated. Seventy percent of BLM predictions were within twofold of the observed median lethal concentrations. However, BLM parameters could be adjusted to improve model performance with this data set. This analysis suggested that in soft waters, the CuOH(+) complex binds more strongly with the biotic ligand and that the competitive effect of hardness cations should be increased. The results of the present study may have implications for application of the BLM to some types of surface waters. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of BLM performance with all available data should be performed, and necessary updates to model parameters should be made to produce the most robust and widely applicable model.

To assess further the relationship between Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and nutrients an enrichment experiment with high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM) was performed with field samples obtained during a Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom. HMWDOM was extracted from water collected at Alfacs Bay. Five bioassays were prepared: N + P (seawater with addition of nitrate and phosphate), DOM (addition of HMWDOM), (-N + P) + DOM (nitrogen deficient, with addition of phosphate and HMWDOM), (N + P) + DOM (addition of nitrate, phosphate and HMWDOM), seawater control (without added nutrients), and B + DOM (control of bacteria, without microalgae). The experiment was run in batch mode over 4 days. Results from the field study revealed that the concentrations of organic nutrients mostly surpassed the inorganic pool. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. was the most frequent and abundant taxa of the microalgae community. The micro-planktonic assemblage was arranged according to a seasonal factor (ANOSIM and cluster analysis). DON, nitrate and silicate were the most important abiotic parameters contributing to the dissimilarities between seasons (SIMPER analysis) and thereby potentially influencing the seasonal distribution of microalgae in the representative station. In the experimental investigation, Pseudo-nitzschia cells increased by the end of the experiment in the DOM bioassay but no respective increase was observed for chlorophyll a. This could point to an acquisition of nutrients through the DOM fraction that would conjointly reduce the need of chlorophyll a. The data obtained suggest that organic nutrients may exert an important role in the development of microalgae, including Pseudo-nitzschia spp., in the selected location. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of possible source markers in marine dissolved organic matter using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the most heterogeneous and largest pools of reactive carbon on earth, rivaling in mass the carbon in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, the molecular-level composition of marine DOM has eluded detailed description, impeding inquiry into the specific mechanisms that add or remove compounds from the DOM pool. Here we describe the molecular-level composition of C(18)-extracted DOM along an east-west transect of the North Atlantic Ocean. We examine the changes in DOM composition along this transect with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics. We use indicator species analysis (ISA) to identify possible source markers for photochemical degradation and heterotrophic bacterial metabolism. The inclusion of ISA in statistical evaluation of DOM mass spectral data allows investigators to determine the m/z values associated with significant changes in DOM composition. With this technique, we observe indicator m/z values in estuarine water that may represent components of terrestrially-derived chromophoric DOM subject to photochemical degradation. We also observe a unique set of m/z values in surface seawater and show that many of these are present in pure cultures of the marine alpha-proteobacterium "Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique" when grown in natural seawater. These findings indicate that a complex balance of abiotic and biotic processes controls the molecular composition of marine DOM to produce signatures that are characteristic of different environments.

J	Birdwell, JE; Engel, AS				Birdwell, Justin E.; Engel, Annette Summers			VARIABILITY IN TERRESTRIAL AND MICROBIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER FLUORESCENCE IN THE EDWARDS AQUIFER, CENTRAL TEXAS	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												Most cave and karst ecosystems are believed to be dependent on an influx of allochthonous organic carbon. Although microbes are largely responsible for the rate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in karst, the role of microbes in chemosynthetic (autochthonous) production and processing of DOM has received limited attention. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is the fraction of DOM that absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and differences in the fluorescence spectral characteristics of humic-like (terrigenous) and protein-like (microbially-derived) CDOM allow for tracing the relative contributions of allochthonous or autochthonous carbon sources, respectively, in water. We investigated CDOM in karst-aquifer well and spring waters along the fresh-to saline-water transition zone of the Edwards Aquifer, Central Texas, over a four year period. The groundwater fluorescence spectral characteristics were distinct from those generally observed in surface waters and soil porewaters. The dominant source of organic carbon in the aquifer waters may be a product of chemolithoautotrophic primary production occurring in situ. It is possible that the absence of a strong terrestrial CDOM signature may be due to filtering effects in the epikarst or rapid utilization by heterotrophs in the aquifer. Our results indicate that intense recharge following periods of drought may influence the intensity of microbial activity, either due to an influx of DOM or nutrients from the surface that was not quantified by our analyses or because of increased in situ autotrophic activity, or both. The variable contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM during and after recharge events call into question whether karst aquifer ecosystems are necessarily dependent on allochthonous organic matter.

The emission spectrum of DOM exhibited a broad peak with a center at 425 nm and a disorder change of the peak with increasing Hg(II) concentrations, which suggested that the structure of DOM was comparatively simple and the fluorescence character of DOM-Hg(II) complexes resulted from interaction of all fluorescence groups. The excitation spectrum of DOM showed that the intensities of two peaks at 392 and 458 nm both decreased with the addition of Hg( H), indicating that different sources, hydroxy and amido groups, were all involved in the DOM-Hg(II) complexation process. Synchronous-scan excitation spectra of DOM-Hg(II) complexation showed that Hg(II) not only produced fluorescence quenching effect, but also enhanced the rigid structure of DOM at a low concentration. The three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of DOM-Hg(II) showed that the peaks A and B reduced strongly and the two peaks tended to shift toward longer wavelength with the concentrations of Hg(II) increasing. These results indicated that protein-like matter reacted with Hg(II) and there was a charge-transfer transition either between energy level in its ligand and a mercury energy level or between two mercury energy levels at the same time. Besides, the decrease in fluorescence intensity of peaks C and D in three-dimensional fluorescence spectra suggested that carbonyl and carboxyl formed bonds with Hg(II) when DOM was complexed with Hg(II).																	1000-0593					AUG	2009	29	8					2204	2207		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2009)08-2204-04						WOS:000269998800043

Chemical and spectroscopic characterization of marine dissolved organic matter isolated using coupled reverse osmosis-electrodialysis	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The coupled reverse osmosis-electrodialysis (RO/ED) method was used to isolate dissolved organic matter (DOM) from 16 seawater samples. The average yield of organic carbon was 75 +/- 12%, which is consistently greater than the yields of organic carbon that have been commonly achieved using XAD resins, C(18) adsorbents, and cross-flow ultrafiltration. UV-visible absorbance spectra and molar C/N ratios of isolated samples were consistent with the corresponding properties of DOM in the original seawater samples, indicating that DOM samples can be isolated using the coupled RO/ED method without any bias for/against these two properties. Five of the samples were desalted sufficiently that reliable measurements of their (13)C and (1)H NMR spectra and their Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectra could be obtained. The (13)C and (1)H NMR spectra of RO/ED samples differed distinctly from those of samples that have been isolated in much lower yields by other methods. In particular, RO/ED samples contained a relatively lower proportion of carbohydrate carbon and a relatively greater proportion of alkyl carbon than samples that have been isolated using cross-flow ultrafiltration. From the FTICR mass spectra of RO/ED samples, samples from the open ocean contained a much lower proportion of unsaturated compounds and a much higher proportion of fatty acids than coastal samples.

J	Xu, XK; Han, L; Luo, XB; Liu, ZR; Han, SJ				Xu, Xingkai; Han, Lin; Luo, Xianbao; Liu, Zirui; Han, Shijie			Effects of nitrogen addition on dissolved N2O and CO2, dissolved organic matter, and inorganic nitrogen in soil solution under a temperate old-growth forest	GEODERMA												Soil solutions at 15 cm and 60 cm depths under a Korean pine and broadleaf mixed forest (>200 years old) at Changbai mountain, northeast China, were sampled using porous ceramic suction cups from July 2006 to October 2007, to study the effects of nitrogen (N) addition on the concentrations of dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved organic matter and inorganic N. The actual concentrations of dissolved N2O and CO2 in soil solutions could be obtained using a combination of continual three phase equilibrations and gas chromatography. The dissolved CO2 concentrations in soil solutions at 15 cm and 60 cm depths varied from 4.3 to 15.5 and from 3.5 to 18.3 mu g CO2-C ml(-1), respectively, and dissolved N2O concentrations at both depths varied from 1.8 to 34.9 and from 2.5 to 99.3 ng N2O-N ml(-1), respectively. The addition of N sources such as (NH4)(2)SO4, NH4Cl and KNO3 at a rate of 4.5 g N/m(2) each year tended to decrease concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solutions at 60 cm depth in 2007, which was contrary to the increase in dissolved CO2 Concentrations under N-fertilized forest plots. However, the N addition did not give an obvious effect on the concentrations of dissolved CO2 and DOC in soil solutions at 15 cm depth. There was an increase in concentrations of NH4+-N. NO3--N and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) of soil solutions under N-fertilized forest plots. Rainfall after thawing in spring could promote the accumulation of dissolved N2O in soil solutions at 15 cm and 60 cm depths, particularly at 60 cm depth under the (NH4)(2)SO4 added plots, due to mineralization of DON and nitrification. All the tested properties of soil solutions at 15 cm and 60 cm depths were well correlated. Among these properties, the dissolved N2O concentrations of soil solutions at both depths were better correlated with the DON concentrations at 60 cm depth, and the dissolved CO2 concentrations at 15 cm depth with the DOC concentrations at both depths. Hence, both DOC and DON can contribute to the formation of dissolved CO2 and N2O in the soil solutions at varying depths under N-fertilized forest plots, respectively. Our observations strongly indicate that N inputs to temperate forest floors can affect the status of N and carbon processes in underlying forest soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Balcarczyk, KL; Jones, JB; Jaffe, R; Maie, N				Balcarczyk, Kelly L.; Jones, Jeremy B., Jr.; Jaffe, Rudolf; Maie, Nagamitsu			Stream dissolved organic matter bioavailability and composition in watersheds underlain with discontinuous permafrost	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We examined the impact of permafrost on dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW), a watershed underlain with discontinuous permafrost, in interior Alaska. We analyzed long term data from watersheds underlain with varying degrees of permafrost, sampled springs and thermokarsts, used fluorescence spectroscopy, and measured the bioavailabity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Permafrost driven patterns in hydrology and vegetation influenced DOM patterns in streams, with the stream draining the high permafrost watershed having higher DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations, higher DOC:DON and greater specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) than the streams draining the low and medium permafrost watersheds. Streams, springs and thermokarsts exhibited a wide range of DOC and DON concentrations (1.5-37.5 mgC/L and 0.14-1.26 mgN/L, respectively), DOC:DON (7.1-42.8) and SUVA (1.5-4.7 L mgC(-1) m(-1)). All sites had a high proportion of humic components, a low proportion of protein components, and a low fluorescence index value (1.3-1.4), generally consistent with terrestrially derived DOM. Principal component analysis revealed distinct groups in our fluorescence data determined by diagenetic processing and DOM source. The proportion of bioavailable DOC ranged from 2 to 35%, with the proportion of tyrosine- and tryptophan-like fluorophores in the DOM being a major predictor of DOC loss (p < 0.05, R (2) = 0.99). Our results indicate that the degradation of permafrost in CPCRW will result in a decrease in DOC and DON concentrations, a decline in DOC:DON, and a reduction in SUVA, possibly accompanied by a change in the proportion of bioavailable DOC.																	0168-2563					JUL	2009	94	3					255	270		10.1007/s10533-009-9324-x						WOS:000266812900005

The purpose was to increase the wastewater's reuse potential by improving water quality. The removal of dissolved organic chemicals was enhanced by adding periodic pulses of hydrogen peroxide while keeping pH above 8.0 throughout the runs. These conditions led to almost complete mineralization in less than 1 h. Under similar conditions, without the addition of hydrogen peroxide, the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) was no higher than 35%. The evolution of TOC was related to the concentration of hydroxyl radicals using a second-order kinetic model in which the exposure to hydroxyl radical was included by assuming a quasi-steady-state approximation. The concentration of hydroxyl radical was computed using the experimental data from ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The kinetic constants for the hydroxyl-mediated mineralization process were determined for wastewaters collected during a 1-year sampling campaign. The results showed that the mineralization process takes place in two periods whose rate constants were linked to the chemical oxygen demand (COD) to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ratio and to the chloride content of wastewaters. During the first part of the runs, the specific rate of mineralization was high, before subsequently decreasing after a period of 5-15 min by an average factor of 6.4 whose 95% confidence interval was in the 3.4-9.3 range. The moles of TOC removed per mole of ozone consumed were in the range of 9.2-17.7 mg O-3/mg TOC measured at maximum ozone efficiency, which always occurred within the first 10 min.

Characteristics of dissolved organic matter after treatment by clinoptilolite-amended activated sludge in association with coagulation processes	DESALINATION												This study was performed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of dissolved organic carbons (DOC) in the effluents coming from a clinoptilolite amended activated sludge with regard to various sludge retention times (SRTs) singularly run or in combination with a coagulation process. First, four laboratory-scale activated sludge reactors were concurrently operated in SRT 5, 10, 20, and 40 days to treat the effluent from a primary settling tank in a municipal wastewater treatment facility. From the experiments, DOC in the, effluents in terms of concentrations of hydrophobic/transphilic/hydrophilic compositions decreased with the increase of SRT. In between SRT 5 and 40 day, the fractions of them ranged from 28.5 to 30.2%, 15.3 to 16.3%, and 54.1 to 56.1%, which suggested that their distributions were not significantly influenced by SRT. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of DOC in that effluent was observed; >3 kDa was in the range of 22.2 to 30.4%, 1 to 3 kDa 14.5 to 27.0%, and <1 kDa 50.8 to 55.2%. Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA; UV(254) absorbance/DOC concentration) of <1 kDa of DOC was lower than 2.0 while that of >1 kDa was greater than 2.0, regardless of SRTs. Increasing SRT attributed to escalating the level of SUVA, but reducing down carbohydrate/protein (C/P) and BOD(5)/COD(Cr) ratios. After coagulation, DOC was additionally removed by up to at the average of 33.1% for whole range of SRTs where hydrophobic/transphilic/hydrophilic fractions were each removed in the range of 29.4 to 47.6%, 50.0 to 63.6%, and 10.5 to 20.0%, respectively. The MWD of DOC showed that the higher the molecular weight, the greater extent was removed. In line with, <1 kDa of DOC was the lowest removed in the range of 15.9 to 24.5%, where hydrophilic and low molecular weight (i.e. <1 kDa) in the effluent were greatest observed ranging from 63.8 to 68.8% and 62.4 to 68.4%, respectively.																	0011-9164					JUL	2009	243	1-3					229	239		10.1016/j.desal.2008.04.025						WOS:000267249700020

Daniel			Influence of Environmental Factors on Pesticide Adsorption by Black Carbon: pH and Model Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Loading two organic acids of known molecular structures onto a black carbon was conducted to study the;Influence of pH and dissolved organic matter on the adsorption of pesticides. Tannic acid at the loading rates of 100 and 300 mu mol/g reduced the surface area of black carbon, by 18 and 63%, respectively. This was due principally to the, blockage of micropores, as verified by measured pore volumes and pore-size distributions. With a comparatively much smaller molecular structure, gallic acid did not apparently influence these properties. The intrinsic acidities of the two acids increased the surface acidity from 1.88 mmol/g of black carbon to 1.93-2.02 mmol/g after DOM loading, resulting in a reduction in isoelectric point pH from 1.93 to 1.66-1.82. The adsorption of propanil, 2,4-D and prometon by black carbon free and loaded of DOM was dependent on pH because major adsorptive forces were the interactions between neutral pesticide molecules and uncharged carbon surfaces. The adsorption was diminished considerably by the deprotonation of 2,4-D and protonation of prometon, as well as the surface charge change of black carbon. Tannic acid of 100 and 300 mu mol/g on black carbon reduced the pesticide adsorption at the equilibrium concentration of 10 mg/L by an average of 46 and 81%, respectively, consistent with the reductions of 42 and 81% in micropore volume At the equilibrium concentration of 30 mg/L, the mesopore surface became the additional adsorptive domain for propanil. Loading tannic acid made the mesopore surface less accessible, due presumably to the enhanced obstruction by tannic acid.																	0013-936X					JUL 1	2009	43	13					4973	4978		10.1021/es900573d						WOS:000267435500056	19673294

CDOM absorption, fluorescence, and the spectral slope indicating the CDOM composition were studied using 0.22-mu m-filtered samples of Meiliang Bay water from Lake Taihu that were exposed to short-term (0-12 h) simulated UV-B radiation and long-term (0-12 days) natural solar radiation in summer. CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence decreased with increasing exposure time, which relates to the amounts of absorbed light energy. The decreases of CDOM absorption and normalized fluorescence corresponded to first order kinetics reactions. Different decreases of CDOM absorption and fluorescence at different wavelengths suggested that the composition of CDOM changed when it absorbed ultraviolet radiation. Photochemical degradation increased the spectral slope during 275-295 nm region (S(275-295)) but decreased the spectral slope during 275-295 nm region (S(350-400)). The slope ratio S(R) (S(275-295): S(350-400)) increased in the photochemical process, which could be used as an indicator of photobleaching and composition change of CDOM. Our results show that photochemical degradation is important in the cycling of CDOM, which indicated change in the composition of CDOM.

Variations in colored dissolved organic matter between boreal lakes studied by satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												There have been major improvements in our understanding of the role of lakes and impoundments in global carbon cycle. Estimating the true role of lakes as sentinels, regulators and integrators of climate change requires analyzing carbon content of vast number of lakes. This is not realistic without using remote sensing methods. There are no satellite sensors at the moment that provide full global coverage and at the same time have spatial and radiometric resolutions suitable for lake color dissolved organic matter (CDOM) mapping. Therefore, the global study has to be performed using more sensitive sensors to create regional lake CDOM statistics for as many sites as possible and extrapolating the results on global lake map that can be created from less sensitive sensor data with full global coverage (Landsat). As a first step towards the global lake carbon mapping we show that the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) allows to study regional variations in lake CDOM content and consequently estimate closely correlated DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and CO2 saturation values. The results show also that there may be regional differences in lake CDOM content even if the study sites are geographically relatively close to each other and occupying zones with similar land cover and annual runoff. In one occasion the difference can be explained with human impact that has caused acidification of lakes but the other occasion needs further studies.

The organic carbon (OC) pool was dominated by dissolved OC (DOC) during baseflow conditions, whereas DOC and particulate OC contributed equally during storms. The nitrogen (N) pool was dominated by NO(3) during baseflow conditions and by particulate organic N (PON) during storms. Dissolved organic N (DON) comprised a similar percentage of the N pool under base- and stormflow conditions. DOC and DON bioavailability both decreased by half during storms in the Wailuku River. Differences in DOM concentrations and bioavailability between base- and stormflow conditions suggest that DOM flowpaths to the river changed from deep to shallow, and that DOM sources switched from autochthonous to allochthonous. Although DOM bioavailability decreased during storms, calculations suggest that storms contributed > 90% to the annual OC and N yields and > 80% to the bioavailable DOM yield from the Wailuku River to coastal waters. Overall, our results suggest that storms are important for delivering bioavailable DOM to coastal waters, where they may stimulate primary and secondary production.																	0024-3590					JUL	2009	54	4					1233	1242		10.4319/lo.2009.54.4.1233						WOS:000268325100017

Contrasting the influences of stream inputs and landscape position on bacterioplankton community structure and dissolved organic matter composition in high- elevation lake chains	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined bacterioplankton community composition (BCC; using polymerase chain reaction-based phylogenetic fingerprinting) and the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM; using scanning fluorometry) within lake chains in high-elevation catchments of the Sierra Nevada, California. We compared temporal BCC dynamics in two connected cirque lakes and their inlets and found that lake : inlet community similarity of both lakes declined with increasing residence time because of seasonal snowpack melting. However, for over 3 yr the headwater lake remained distinct from its inlet even during peak snowmelt (residence time < 5 d), whereas the downstream lake was consistently similar to both its inlet and the upstream lake. We subsequently sampled 17 lake chains (4-8 lakes each) throughout the Sierra Nevada longitudinally to examine how landscape position and catchment characteristics influenced the similarity in BCC and DOM among lakes and their connecting streams. Headwater lakes were significantly less similar to their inlet streams than were downstream lakes. BCC was heterogeneous throughout each catchment, but headwater inlet BCC was consistently distinct from all downstream samples. In contrast, DOM exhibited a trend of increasing homogeneity as water moved downstream: upstream and downstream waters were distinct but without clear headwater outliers. The similarity in BCC and DOM between any two lakes within a chain declined with geographic distance. Our results illustrate the contrasting roles of environmental selection and dispersal in structuring bacterioplankton communities, supporting both strong within-lake environmental selection for communities distinct from terrigenous inputs and a weaker effect of geographic dispersal differentiating communities among lakes linked by advective flow.																	0024-3590					JUL	2009	54	4					1292	1305		10.4319/lo.2009.54.4.1292						WOS:000268325100022

The environmental effect of these amendments on pesticide transport is ambiguous: on the one hand it could enhance their retention by increasing soil organic carbon content; on the other hand, dissolved organic matter (DOM) could facilitate their transport. Elutions were performed using columns packed with glass beads in order to investigate DOM-diuron interactions, and the possible co-transport of diuron and DOM. Four organic amendments (A, B, C and D) were tested; C and D were sampled at fresh (F) and mature (M) stages. An increase in diuron leaching was observed only for A and D(F) amendments (up to 16% compared to the DOM-free blank samples), suggesting a DOM effect on diuron transport. These results could be explained by the higher DOM leaching for A and D(F) compared to B, C(F), C(M) and D(M) increasing diuron-DOM interactions. These interactions seem to be related to the aromatic and aliphatic content of the DOM, determining formation of hydrogen and non-covalent bonds. The degree of organic matter maturity does not seem to have any effect with amendment C, while a reduction in diuron leaching is observed between DF and D(M). After equilibrium dialysis measurement of diuron-DOM complexes, it appeared that less than 3% of the diuron applied corresponded to complexes with a molecular weight > 1000 Da. Complexes < 1000 Da could also take part in this facilitated transport. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter transported by the Mackenzie River to the Beaufort Sea	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The photoreactivity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) transported to Arctic shelf environments by rivers has only recently been studied and its quantitative role in Arctic shelf biogeochemistry has received little attention. Sunlight exposure experiments were performed on CDOM collected over a three year period (2002 to 2004) from river, estuary, shelf, and gulf regions of the Western Canadian Arctic. Decreases in CDOM absorption, synchronous fluorescence (SF), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were followed after 3 days of exposure, and in two experiments, six optical cutoff filters were used to incrementally remove ultraviolet radiation incident on the samples. Apparent quantum yields for CDOM photobleaching (AQY(ble)) and for DOC photomineralization (AQY(min)) were computed. as were two AQY spectra (phi(ble) and phi(min)) for the Mackenzie River and a sample from the Mackenzie Shelf The photoreactivity of Mackenzie River CDOM was highest after break-up and peak discharge and lowest in late summer. The half-lives of CDOM and DOC were estimated at 3.7 days and 4.8 days, respectively. when Mackenzie River water was exposed to full sunlight. Photobleaching of Mackenzie River CDOM fluorescence after most UV-B wavelengths were removed increased the correlation between the river and offshore waters in the Beaufort Sea. When light attenuation from particle- and CDOM-rich river water was considered for the Mackenzie Shelf, our photodegradation models estimated around 10% loss of absorption and < 1% DOC loss, suggesting that sunlight exposure does not substantially degrade CDOM on Arctic shelves.

Impact of halides on the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Understanding absorbance photobleaching of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is important because DOM chromophores impact oceanic primary productivity by affecting the depth of the photic zone, absorb UV radiation and affect ocean color used in remote sensing. However, the fundamental mechanisms which account for this bleaching are largely unknown. Controlled laboratory studies demonstrated that the presence of seawater concentrations of chloride and bromide ions enhanced absorbance photobleaching reaction rates by similar to 40%, regardless of DOM source or the presence or absence of carbonate ions. In contrast, halide ions generally did not affect fluorescence bleaching rates. Variations in ionic strength did not alter the enhancement in absorbance photobleaching by halide ions. Accordingly, the enhancement in absorbance photobleaching was specific to halide ions, rather than a generalized salinity effect. We confirmed the formation of hydroxyl radical (HO(center dot)) in illuminated samples, and its significant scavenging in the presence of halide salts. Gamma-radiolysis experiments and associated modeling indicated that a small component (similar to 12%) of the photobleaching enhancement by halides was consistent with the hypothesis that halide scavenging of HO(center dot) will form reactive halogen radicals that target electron-rich chromophores within DOM more selectively than HO(center dot) The mechanism responsible for the major component of absorbance photobleaching rate enhancement by halides remains unresolved.

J	Sulzberger, B; Durisch-Kaiser, E				Sulzberger, Barbara; Durisch-Kaiser, Edith			Chemical characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM): A prerequisite for understanding UV-induced changes of DOM absorption properties and bioavailability	AQUATIC SCIENCES												UV-induced transformations of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM, which is part of dissolved organic matter, DOM) affect CDOM absorption properties resulting in the loss of color (referred to as photobleaching). CDOM photobleaching increases the penetration depths of the damaging UV-B radiation into water bodies and strongly depends on the wavelength of solar radiation and on the pH of aquatic systems. UV-induced transformations also affect DOM availability to bacterioplankton, often enhancing the bioavailability of terrigenous DOM and in turn microbial respiration. The combination of UV-induced enhancement of DOM bioavailability and increased export of terrigeneous DOM into estuaries and coastal waters due to climate-related changes in continental hydrology could result in a UV-mediated positive feedback of CO(2) accumulation in the atmosphere. The extent and type of CDOM photobleaching and of UV-induced changes in DOM bioavailability depend on (C)DOM chemical composition, which in turn undergoes drastic changes upon UV-induced transformations. Therefore, the chemical characterization of (C)DOM is key for rationalizing UV-induced transformations. In the second section (after the "Introduction"), we review important methods for the elucidation of the chemical composition of (C)DOM. However, this article is not intended to be comprehensive regarding (C)DOM chemical characterization. An important purpose is to provide photochemical bases for the understanding of UV-induced changes of (C)DOM absorption properties and bioavailability (mainly discussed in the sections "Pathways of DOM phototransformations" and "UV-induced changes of the absorption properties of CDOM").

In order to constrain those sources and processes, molecular variations of pore water DOM in surface sediments from the NW Iberian shelf were analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and compared to river and marine water column DOM. Weighted average molecular element ratios of oxygen to carbon ((O/C)(wa)) and hydrogen to carbon ((H/C)(wa)) provided general information about DOM sources. DOM in local rivers was more oxygenated ((O/C)(wa) 0.52) and contained less hydrogen ((H/C)(wa) 1.15) than marine pore water DOM (mean (O/C)(wa) 0.50, mean (H/C)(wa) 1.26). The relative abundance of specific compound groups, such as highly oxygenated aromatic compounds or nitrogen-bearing compounds with low H/C ratios, correspond to a high concentration of lignin phenols (160 mu g/g sediment dry weight) and a high TOC/TN ratio (13.3) in the sedimentary organic matter and were therefore assigned to terrestrial sources. The lower degree of unsaturation and a higher relative abundance of nitrogen-bearing compounds in the pore water DOM reflected microbial activity within the sediment. One sampling site on the shelf with a high sediment accumulation, and a humic-rich river sample showed a wide range of sulfur compounds in the DOM, accompanied by a higher abundance of lipid biomarkers for sulfate-reducing bacteria, probably indicating early diagenetic sulfurization of organic matter.

Water samples were taken from an Arctic seep adjacent the Oksrukuyik River (OKS) on the north slope of Alaska, USA, where DOM is derived primarily from allochthonous material and from a eutrophic mid-latitude wetland, Old Woman Creek (OWC), in northern Ohio, USA, where the DOM is formed from both allochthonous and autochthonous precursors. DOM-mediated TMP photolysis occurred for all samples, but was significantly faster in the OWC isolates. The method used to isolate DOM also influenced TMP photoreactivity, whereby the C-18 and XAD isolated material were typically more reactive than ultrafiltered DOM. Analysis of the isolates by spectroscopy revealed that the materials isolated by chromatography were relatively enriched in aromatic constituents, while the TFUF fraction had the lowest aromaticity based on molar absorptivity at 280 nm. The fluorescence index values revealed differences between OKS and OWC, but no discernable trends were observed among isolates. This study shows that both the manner in which DOM is isolated and the composition of its precursors will influence its triplet state photoreactivity.																	1541-5856					JUN	2009	7						391	398								WOS:000268838500002

Properties of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the Gironde Estuary	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The isolation, characterization and study of the properties of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) still represent a challenge because of the heterogeneity, complexity and low concentration of organic material in natural waters. Based on its ability to interact with contaminants and thus to modify their transport and bioavailability, DOM is of interest for environmental purposes. The objective of this work was to better characterize DOM in the Gironde Estuary (southwestern France). The estuary represents an exchange zone between the continent and the Atlantic Ocean and conditions the transfer of organic and inorganic substances from the continental to the oceanic environment. Several samples were collected along the estuary during three cruises in 2002 and 2006. They were analysed using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, a sensitive technique that allows direct analysis of water samples. Fluorescent DOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) did not behave conservatively in this estuarine system, i.e. the organic material did not undergo simple dilution from the upstream to the downstream part of the estuary. A seasonal variability in DOC content was pointed out, whereas few seasonal variations in DOM fluorescence were observed. DOM sources and processing in the estuary were further evaluated by determining two fluorescence indices - the humification index (HIX) and the index of recent autochthonous contribution (BIX). By applying these indices, the relative degree of humification (HIX) and autotrophic productivity (BIX) could be assessed. Based on the fluorescence and DOC results, the estuary was divided into three zones depending on salinity (S) and characterized by specific DOM: (i) A turbid zone of low salinity (S < 5) and high suspended particulate matter concentration with increase in the intensities of the alpha' and alpha fluorophores, characteristic of humic-like compounds. (ii) A mid-estuarine zone (5 < S < 25) characterized by low autortrophic productivity and containing strongly degraded organic material, as shown by the low values of BIX and high values of HIX. (iii) A higher salinity area (S > 25) characterized by increased autortrophic productivity and a marked marine influence, and associated with high and low values of BIX and HIX, respectively. The HIX and BIX indices were shown as useful tools for readily defining and classifying DOM characteristics in estuarine waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a soil solution influences the mobility and bioavailability of metals in soil. The present study examined the effects of plant growth on DOM-metal complexes in a rhizosphere soil solution using size exclusion chromatography combined with an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer system (SEC-ICP-MS) and an ultrafiltration technique. Humus-rich volcanic ash soil from the surface of an agricultural field was used in a pot cultivation experiment. Brassica rapa nothovar. was cultivated in a pot in which rhizosphere soil (R) was separated by a nylon net screen from non-rhizosphere soil (NR). Soil solutions were collected using a high-speed centrifugation method 3 weeks after sowing and analyzed using SEC-ICP-MS. Some peaks of DOM with a high molecular size were detected in the ultraviolet-absorbing chromatograph (280 nm) of the soil solution samples. Their concentrations were much higher in the R solution than in the NR solution. Metals including Al, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Y, La and U were detected at the ultraviolet peak positions of the DOM. The ultrafiltration experiment showed that the size distributions of the organic materials to which the metals were combined differed between the R and NR soil solutions. These results suggest that plant growth enhanced the dissolution of metals adsorbed with organic matter from the solid phase in rhizosphere soil.

Many researchers believe that hydrophobic natural organic matter is the main foulant. In this research, fulvic acid, tannin, and aniline were used to represent hydrophobic acid, neutral, and base, respectively, to investigate modified polyvinyl chloride ultrafiltration membrane fouling characteristics. Four kinds of cleaning methods were used in this study: flushing, backwashing, flushing and backwashing, and chemical cleaning with 0.5% sodium hydroxide. Each was performed on the three hydrophobic dissolved organic matters ( acid, neutral, and base) to identify the fouling mechanisms of polyvinyl chloride ultrafiltration membrane.

Organic acids were the most abundant fractions of DOM. Hydrophobic organics especially hydrophobic acids were found to have higher overall disinfection by-products formation potential (DBPFP). Moreover, the potential decreased as the sequence of acids, neutrals and bases. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry at 254 nm (UV(254)), fluorescence spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to characterize DOM fractions. And the relationship between the characteristics of DOM fractions and the related DBPFP was discussed in detail. It was found that UV(254) to DOC ratio (SUVA) exhibited a positive correlation with haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation potential whereas distinctive linear correlation was not observed between SUVA and trihalomethanes (THMs) formation potential. Of the fluorescence organics contained in DOM. humic acids exhibited higher chlorine reactivity than fulvic acids. Smaller molecules of humic acids produced more DBPs. Furthermore, a combination of aromatic moieties and aliphatic structures with v(C-O) groups contributed largely to the formation of DBPs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Production of bioavailable and refractory dissolved organic matter by coastal heterotrophic microbial populations	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by heterotrophic microbial communities isolated from Loch Creran (Scotland) was studied in time course incubations in which cells were re-suspended in artificial seawater amended with variable proportions of glucose, ammonium and phosphate. The incubation experiments demonstrated that microheterotrophs released part of the substrate as new DOM, with a production efficiency of 11 +/- 1% for DOC, 18 +/- 2% for DON and 17 +/- 2% for DOP. Estimating the impact of this production in Loch Creran, showed that from 3 +/- 1% (DOC) to 72 +/- 16% (DOP) of DOM could originate from the heterotrophic microbial community. The produced DOM (PDOM) was both bioavailable (BDOM) and refractory (RDOM). Bioavailability as assessed by the difference between the maximum and the end DOM concentration, was generally higher than found in natural systems, with DOP (73 +/- 15%, average +/- SD) more bioavailable than DON (70 +/- 15%), and DON than DOC (34 +/- 13%). The stoichiometry of PDOM was linked to both nutrient uptake and BDOM ratios. Absorption and fluorescence of DOM increased significantly during the incubation time, indicating that microheterotrophs were also a source of coloured DOM (CDOM) and that they produce both bioavailable protein-like and refractory humic-like fluorophores.

Chemical and isotopic composition of high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter from the Mississippi River plume	MARINE CHEMISTRY												In order to examine the source and transformation of high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM) in the mixing zone of the Mississippi River plume, HMW-DOM with sizes between 1 kDa and 0.2 mu m was collected along a salinity gradient using cross-flow ultrafiltration. Isolated OM samples were desalted, freeze-dried and characterized for elemental (C and N) and biochemical composition (proteins, carbohydrates and uronic acids), stable isotopic (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and radiocarbon (Delta C-14) signatures, and relative molecular composition using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The organic carbon content of HMW-DOM samples ranged from 31 to 36 wt.%, indicating that isolated colloids are mostly organic in nature. Contents of N ranged from 1.9% to 3.3%, resulting in a C/N ratio of 19-20 at lower salinity stations with a strong influence by terrestrial DOM and 12-15 at higher salinity stations with more freshly photosynthesized marine DOM. While OC-normalized protein contents decreased with increasing salinity, both carbohydrate and uronic acid contents increased with increasing salinity. Variations of pyrograms demonstrated that the proportion of furfural (an indicator of polysaccharides) in HMW-DOM also increased with increasing salinity, while the proportion of phenols decreased with increasing salinity. Changes in carbohydrate, (acid) polysaccharide and phenol contents of HMW-DOM samples reflect the variation in DOM sources along the salinity gradient, with higher phenol and low polysaccharide contents in lower salinity areas but higher polysaccharide and low phenol contents in coastal waters. Values of delta C-13 increased from -25.24 parts per thousand at the Mississippi River fresh water end-member station to -21.86 parts per thousand at an offshore station in the Gulf of Mexico. Changes in stable isotope composition resemble the changes in molecular composition from freshwater to coastal waters. Values of delta N-15, on the other hand, varied little, from 3.5 parts per thousand to 4.9 parts per thousand without a consistent trend, indicating that delta N-15 is a less sensitive source tracer. Measured radiocarbon signatures (Delta C-14) expressed as apparent C-14 ages ranged from > modern at lower salinity stations to 400-800 y BP at coastal stations. Results of isotopic mass balance revealed that, in addition to end-member organic matter from river and marine sources, at least 10-25% of the HMW-DOM could derive from reworked or regenerated DOM in the Mississippi River plume, most likely through sediment-water interactions and lateral transport. Thus, reworking processes are important in governing the chemical and isotopic composition of DOM in the estuarine mixing zone. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental methodology was based on the differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetric (DPASV) determination of labile copper species by titrating the sample using increments of copper additions uniformly distributed on the logarithmic scale. A classical at-equilibrium approach (determination of copper complexing capacity, CuCC) and a kinetic approach (tracing of equilibrium reconstitution) of copper complexation were considered and compared. A model of discrete distribution of organic ligands forming inert copper complexes was applied. For both approaches, a home-written fitting program was used for the determination of apparent stability constants (K(i)(equ)), total ligands concentration (L(iT)) and association/dissociation rate constants (k(i)(1),k(i)(-1)). A non-conservative behaviour of dissolved organic matter (DOC) and total copper concentration in a water column was registered. An enhanced biological activity at the freshwater-seawater interface (FSI) triggered an increase of total copper concentration and total ligand concentration in this water layer. The copper complexation in fresh water of Krka River was characterised by one type of binding ligands, while in most of the estuarine and marine samples two classes of ligands were identified. The distribution of apparent stability constants (log K(i)(equ): 11.2-13.0, log K(2)(equ):8.8-10.0) showed increasing trend towards higher salinities, indicating stronger copper complexation by autochthonous seawater organic matter. Copper complexation parameters (ligand concentrations and apparent stability constants) obtained by at-equilibrium model are in very good accordance with those of kinetic model. Calculated association rate constants (k(1)(1):6.1-20 x 10(3) (M s)(-1), k(2)(1) : 1.3-6.3 x 10(3) (M s)(-1)) indicate that copper complexation by DNOM takes place relatively slowly. The time needed to achieve a new pseudo-equilibrium induced by an increase of copper concentration (which is common for Krka River estuary during summer period due to the nautical traffic), is estimated to be from 2 to 4 h. It is found that in such oligotrophic environment (dissolved organic carbon content under 83 mu M(C). i.e. 1 mg(C)L(-1)) an increase of the total copper concentration above 12 nM could enhance a free copper concentration exceeding the level considered as potentially toxic for microorganisms (10 pM).

Using synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and principal components analysis to monitor dissolved organic matter dynamics in a glacier system	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The molecular characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) reflect both its source material and its biogeochemical history. In glacial systems, DOM characteristics might be expected to change over the course of a melt season as changes in the glacier drainage system cause the mobilization of DOM from different OM pools. To test this hypothesis we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of synchronous fluorescence spectra to detect and describe changes ill the DOM in meltwater from a glacier system in the Coast Mountains of northern British Columbia, Canada. For most of the melt season, the dominant component of subglacially routed meltwater DOM is characterized by a tyrosine-like fluorophore. This DOM component is most likely derived from supraglacial snowmelt. During periods of high discharge, a second component of DOM is present which is humic in character and similar to DOM sampled from a nearby non-glacial stream. This DOM component is inferred to be derived from a moss-covered soil environment that has been glacially overrun. It is probably entrained into glacial melt waters when the supraglacial meltwater flux exceeds the capacity of the principal subglacial drainage channels and water floods areas of the glacier bed that are normally isolated from the subglacial drainage system. Another source of DOM also appears to be mobilized during periods of high air temperatures. It is characterized by both humic and proteinaceous fluorophores and may be derived from the drainage of supraglacial cryoconite holes. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Soils, Ltd.

Chemical characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in rainwater	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR), UV absorbance and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy were used to define the chemical characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in whole and C(18) extracted rainwater. The average total recovery of fluorescence determined from the SLIM of extract and filtrate fractions relative to the whole was 86% Suggesting that 14% of fluorescent CDOM in rainwater is comprised of very hydrophobic material that cannot be eluted from the column. Half the fluorescence of rainwater was recovered in the filtrate fraction which is important because it suggests that 50% of the chromophoric material present in precipitation is relatively hydrophilic. The average spectral slope coefficient was smaller in extracted samples (16.3 +/- 9.0 mu m(-1)) relative to whole samples (18.9 +/- 2.8 mu m(-1)) suggesting that the extracted material contains larger molecular weight material. Approximately one-third of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rainwater exists in the extract fraction suggesting that a large percentage of the uncharacterized DOC in rainwater can be accounted for by these hydrophobic macromolecular species. The fluorescence of extracted samples is strongly correlated with total NMR integration and is most sensitive to aromatic protons suggesting that molecules in this region are the most important in controlling the optical properties of rainwater. The lower removal efficiency of CDOM in rainwater relative to surface waters or the water-soluble fraction of aerosols during solid phase extraction (SPE) suggests that rainwater contains significantly more hydrophilic chromophoric compounds which are compositionally different than found in these other aquatic matrices.

Temporal dynamics of dissolved combined neutral sugars and the quality of dissolved organic matter in the Northwestern Sargasso Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The dynamics of dissolved combined neutral sugars (DCNS) were assessed in the upper 250 m at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site between 2001 and 2004. Our results reveal a regular annual pattern of DCNS accumulation with concentrations increasing at a rate of 0.009-0.012 mu mol C L(-1) d(-1) in the surface 40 m from March to July and reaching maximum mean concentrations of 2.2-3.3 mu mol C L(-1). Winter convective mixing (between January and March) annually exported surface-accumulated DCNS to the upper mesopelagic zone (100-250 m), as concentrations increased there by 0.3-0.6 mu mol C L(-1). The exported DCNS was subsequently removed over a period of weeks following restratification of the water column. Vertical and temporal trends in DCNS yield (% of DOC) supported its use as a diagenetic indicator of DOM quality. Higher DCNS yields in surface waters suggested a portion of the DOM accumulated relatively recently compared to the more recalcitrant material of the upper mesopelagic that had comparably lower yields. DCNS yields and mol% neutral sugar content, together, indicated differences in the diagenetic state of the surface-accumulated and deep pools of DOM. Seasonally accumulated, recently produced DOM with higher DCNS yields was characterized by elevated mol% of galactose and mannose+xylose levels. Conversely, more recalcitrant DOM from depths > 100 m had lower DCNS yields but higher mol% of glucose. Lower DCNS yields and elevated mol% glucose were also observed in the surface waters during winter convective mixing, indicating an entrainment of a diagenetically altered DOM pool into the upper 100 m. A multivariate statistical analysis confirms the use of DCNS as an index of shifts in DOM quality at this site. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

INVESTIGATING AGGREGATION IN SUWANNEE RIVER, USA, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER USING DIFFUSION-ORDERED NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Aggregation of the Suwannee River (USA) dissolved organic matter (SRDOM) is studied using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy identifies two distinct bands, one corresponding to smaller components and the other to larger components. At lower concentrations (500 ppm), the dissolved organic matter (DOM) is present mainly as small components; however, with increasing concentration, the larger components become more pronounced as a result of aggregation. Calibrations indicate the small materials behave in a manner similar to that of maltodextrins of approximately 180 to 950 Da or proteins of 100 to 1,000 Da. The aggregated species show behavior similar to that of maltodextrins of approximately 1,000 to 21,000 Da or proteins of 1,050 to 70,000 Da. The mean diffusivity of the aggregated components in SRDOM is consistent with that of maltodextrins of approximately 4,500 Da and proteins of approximately 8,000 Da at the highest concentration measured. At the lowest concentration (closest to environmental concentrations), little to no aggregation is observed. Diffusion profiles show an increase in large-molecular-weight material, with a simultaneous decrease in small-molecular-weight components with increasing DOM concentration. This suggests aggregates in SRDOM may be weak dispersive associations of low-molecular-weight material. Additionally, with a decrease in temperature, aggregates show faster diffusion, suggesting a tighter, more condensed arrangement. Further evidence supports DOM aggregation as conglomerations of numerous components in DOM rather than a more organized self-association. Carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) play a prominent role in aggregation of SRDOM and, to a lesser extent, material-derived from linear terpenoids (MDLT). The role of lignin and carbohydrates is less clear, although at least some of the lignin is present as macromolecules and tends to show interactions with both the MDLT and CRAM components.																	0730-7268	1552-8618				MAY	2009	28	5					931	939								WOS:000265223600006	19102581

Understanding the enhanced aqueous solubility of styrene by terrestrial dissolved organic matter using stable isotope mass balance and FTIR	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We present a new stable isotope mass balance method for measuring the enhanced aqueous solubility of specific organic compounds in the presence of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM). It involves interfacing a standard dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analyzer with a stable isotope ratio monitoring system, is applicable to a wide range of model organic compounds and can be tuned to provide maximum precision for a given range of compound solubility and initial natural DOC concentration. Using (13)C-labeled styrene as a model compound, we applied the method to investigate the reactivity of Dismal Swamp DOM as a function of season, nominal molecular size and chemical composition as determined using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The solubility enhancement of styrene ranged from 23% to 118% relative to deionized water, while DOC-normalized enhancements varied from about 0.04 to 0.35 mu M styrene/mu M DOC as a function of season and nominal molecular weight. Statistical analysis of FTIR spectra reveals a strong positive correlation between the styrene concentration and the carboxyl content of the natural DOM. Reactivity differences between high molecular weight (HMW), low molecular weight (LMW) and total DOM samples are consistent with potential variations in their higher order structures.

Functional speciation of metal-dissolved organic matter complexes by size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and deconvolution analysis	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY												High performance size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HP-SEC-ICP-MS), in combination with deconvolution analysis, has been used to obtain multielemental qualitative and quantitative information about the distributions of metal complexes with different forms of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM). High performance size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry chromatograms only provide continuous distributions of metals with respect to molecular masses, due to the high heterogeneity of dissolved organic matter, which consists of humic substances as well as biomolecules and other organic compounds. A functional speciation approach. based on the determination of the metals associated to different groups of homologous compounds, has been followed. Dissolved organic matter groups of homologous compounds are isolated from the aqueous samples under study and their high performance size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry elution profiles fitted to model Gaussian peaks, characterized by their respective retention times and peak widths. High performance size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry chromatograms of the samples are deconvoluted with respect to these model Gaussian peaks. This methodology has been applied to the characterization of metal-dissolved organic matter complexes in compost leachates. The most significant groups of homologous compounds involved in the complexation of metals in the compost leachates studied have been hydrophobic acids (humic and fulvic acids) and low molecular mass hydrophilic compounds. The environmental significance of these compounds is related to the higher biodegradability of the low molecular mass hydrophilic compounds and the lower mobility of humic acids. In general, the hydrophilic compounds accounted for the complexation of around 50% of the leached metals, with variable contributions of humic and fulvic acids, depending on the nature of the samples and the metals.

The position, number and intensity of fluorescence peak in the spectra and the relations of the peaks were analyzed to determine the type, distribution and origin of the fluorescence dissolved organic matter. Seven types of fluorescence peaks were detected from the samples. There are protein-like fluorescence peaks B with Ex(max)/Em(max) = 275/300 nm, D with Ex(max)/Em(max) = 225/295-305 nm, T with Ex(max)/Em(max) = 280/345 nm, and S with Ex(max)/Em(max) = 225-240/320-350 nm, two humic-like peaks A with Ex(max)/Em(max) = 250-255/410-455 nm and C 335-345/410-440 ran, and marine humic peak M with Ex(max)/Em(max) = 305 nm/400-420 nm. Peaks B, S and A appeared in all surveyed area. Peaks T and D appeared in the north of the surveyed area. Peaks M and C only appeared in a few stations. In the surface layer, the source of the fluorescence dissolved organic matter might be the fresh water outflow of the Yangtze River, while the fluorescence dissolved organic matter in the middle layer had double sources from the Yangtze River and the phytoplankton.

The relationships between fluorescence peak intensity, and salinity and chlorophyll-a were discussed. The centers of protein-like fluorescence peaks dispersed at Ex(max)/Em(max) = 270-280/290-315 nm (Peak B), 220-230/290-305 nm (Peak D), 230-240/335-350 nm(Peak S)and 280/320 nm(Peak T). Two humic-like peaks appeared at 255-270/435-480 nm (Peak A) and 330-350/420-480 nm(Peak C). High tyrosine-like intensity was observed in diatom red tide dispersion area, and tryptophan-like fluorescence was also found which was lower. High FIB/FIS showed that diatom red tide produced much tyrosine-like matter during dispersion. Peaks S, A and C had positive correlation with one another, and their distributions were similar, which decreased with distance increasing away from the shore. Good negative correlations between peaks S, A and C and salinity suggested that Jiangsu-Zhejiang coastal water was the same source of then-L Correlations between fluorescence peak intensity and chlorophyll-a were not remarkable enough to clear the relationship between fluorescence and living algal matter. It was supposed that the living algal matter contributed little to the fluorescence intensity of algal dispersion seawater.																	1000-0593					MAY	2009	29	5					1349	1353		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2009)05-1349-05						WOS:000265756100046

The vertical distribution and seasonal changes of DOM and its fractions were evaluated. The concentrations of DOM, HoA and Hi in surface water samples from Lake Biwa tended to be high in the summer and low in the winter. In the Summer, the concentrations of DOM, HoA and Hi varied greatly in the lake thermocline (depth 10 similar to 20 m). The increase in the concentrations of DOM, HoA and Hi in Lake Biwa during the warm season may be attributed to algal DOM. The trihalomethane (THM) formation potential of water samples collected from Lake Biwa was high at a depth of 10 m and 35 similar to 40 mu g L(-1) at depths lower than 20 m. The THM formation potential per organic carbon unit of algal DOM was larger than that of soil humic Substances, and its order was as follows : Microcystis aeruginosa > Cryptomonas ovata > Staurastrum dorcidentiferum.																	0525-1931					APR	2009	58	4					231	240								WOS:000266967400006

This study was focused on the characterization of leachate dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its relationship with PAEs removal, through measures such as: three-dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy, UV/Vis absorbance and molecular weight (MW) fractionation of leachate. The results showed that less than 32% of the PAEs in the fresh leachate could be removed with a CF process. The removal of PAEs in the fresh leachate was related to the hydrophobicity of PAEs and the MW of the leachate DOM. For the partially stabilized leachate, the reduction of PAEs was about 50%. The decrease of the PAEs concentrations had a close relationship with the high aromaticity and large MW of the DOM present in the raw leachate. The humic-PAEs complex enhanced the PAEs removal in the CF process. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analytical intercomparison between type I and type II long-pathlength liquid core waveguides for the measurement of chromophoric dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												In the past decade, technological advances in optical sensors have facilitated an increased understanding of the relationship between optical characteristics and biogeochemistry of our oceans. In particular, long-pathlength liquid core waveguide cells (LCWs) are being used to "map" chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as a biogeochemical tracer, in various coastal and open ocean regions. At present, two LCW cell types are used in the study of marine CDOM, and concerns about discrepancies in data collected with the different cell types and problems with baseline offsets have arisen. We conducted a direct comparison of absorption coefficient spectra of a dissolved spectrophotometric standard, molecular weight standard (MWS), and dilution series of natural seawater obtained in type I and type II LCWs to assess data agreement and potential colloid-mediated biases. Although no statistical difference was observed for the dissolved standard, we found the type I to have a slight bias toward higher absorption coefficient values for MWS 14-150 kDa (within 95% confidence interval) and natural seawater. Seawater CDOM spectral slopes differed significantly between type I and type II LCWs, with a maximum difference in slope of 0.0006 nm(-1). Fastidious elimination of microbubbles from the capillary cells greatly reduced baseline offsets and markedly improved CDOM spectral slope precision.

The spatial distribution of CDOM in the German Bight shows a strong gradient towards the coast. Tidal and seasonal variations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) identify freshwater discharge via flood-gates at the coastline and pore water efflux from tidal flat sediments as the most important CDOM sources within the backbarrier area of the Island of Spiekeroog. However, the amount and pattern of CDOM and DOC is strongly affected by various parameters, e.g. changes in the amount of terrestrial run-off, precipitation, evaporation, biological activity and photooxidation. A decoupling of CDOM and DOC, especially during periods of pronounced biological activity (algae blooms and microbial activity), is observed in spring and especially in summer. Mixing of the endmembers freshwater, pore water, and open sea water results in the formation of a coastal transition zone. Whilst an almost conservative behaviour during mixing is observed in winter, summer data point towards non-conservative mixing.

Both samples were collected from the lower and middle salinity areas in Jiulong Estuary of Xiamen Bay, and then filtered by 0.2 mu m polycarbonate filters before the photobleaching incubation experiment. The results showed that three humic-like (C, A, M) and two protein-like (T, B) fluorescence peaks were observed in both samples, and the photobleaching didn't cause obvious shift of the positions of these fluorescence peaks. The fluorescence intensities of the,five peaks decreased with the increase in irradiation time and peak C demonstrated the fastest photobleaching rate. The photobleaching rate of low salinity sample was higher than that of middle salinity sample, consistent with its higher content of chromophores. All the five fluorophores could be distinguished into labile and refractory components based on their photobleaching dynamics. The increase in the intensity ratios of peak T and C (I(T)/I(C)) and peak T and C (I(A)/I(C)) after irradiation suggested that photobleaching can cause obvious change of the properties of dissolved organic matter in seawater, and it may partly account for the dominance of the protein-like fluorescence relative to the humic-like fluorescence in coastal area. The results suggest that EEMs was a useful toot to trace the transformation and removal processes of terrestrial CDOM entering the coastal regions.

Three fluorescence peaks could be identified from the EEM fluorescence spectra of the DOM samples in the MBR. Two peaks were associated with the protein-like fluorophores, and the third was related to the visible humic acid-like fluorophores. Only two main peaks were observed in the EEM fluorescence spectra of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) samples, which were due to the fluorescence of protein-like and humic acid-like matters, respectively. However, the EEM fluorescence spectra of membrane foulants were observed to have three peaks. It was also found that the dominant fluorescence substances in membrane foulants were protein-like substances, which might be due to the retention of proteins in the DOM and/or EPS in the MBR by the fine pores of the membrane. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence spectra including peak locations, fluorescence intensity, and different peak intensity ratios and the fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analysis were also carried out in order to better understand the similarities and differences among the EEM spectra of the DOM, EPS, and membrane foulant samples and to further provide an insight into membrane fouling caused by the fluorescence substances in the DOM in submerged MBRs.

J	Blodau, C; Bauer, M; Regenspurg, S; Macalady, D				Blodau, Christian; Bauer, Markus; Regenspurg, Simona; Macalady, Donald			Electron accepting capacity of dissolved organic matter as determined by reaction with metallic zinc	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Information about the chemical electron accepting capacity (EAC) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is scarce owing to a lack of applicable methods. We quantified the electron transfer from metallic Zn to natural DOM in batch experiments at DOC concentrations of 10-100 mg-C L(-1) and related it to spectroscopic information obtained from UV-, synchronous fluorescence, and FTIR- spectroscopy. The electron donating capacity of DOM and pre-reduced DOM was investigated using Fe(CN)(6)(3-) as electron acceptor. Presence of DOM resulted in release of dissolved Zn, consumption of protons, and slower release of hydrogen compared to reaction of metallic Zn with water at pH 6.5. Comparison with reaction stoichiometry confirmed that DOM accepted electrons from metallic Zn. The release of dissolved Zn was dependent on pH, DOC concentration, ionic strength, and organic matter properties. The reaction appeared to be completed within about 24 h and was characterized by pseudo first order kinetics with rate constants of 0.5 to 0.8 h(-1). EAC per mass unit of carbon ranged from 0.22 mmol g(-1) C to 12.6 mmol g(-1) C. Depending on the DOM, a calculated 28-127% of the electrons transferred from metallic Zn to DOM could be subsequently donated to Fe(CN)(6)(3-). EAC decreased with DOC concentration, and increased with aromaticity, carboxyl, and phenolic content of the DOM. The results indicate that an operationally defined EAC of natural DOM can be quantified by reaction with metallic Zn and that DOM properties control the electron transfer. Shortcomings of the method are the coagulation and precipitation of DOM during the experiment and the production of hydrogen and dissolved Zn by reaction of metallic Zn with water, which may influence the determined EAC.

J	Sanderman, J; Lohse, KA; Baldock, JA; Amundson, R				Sanderman, Jonathan; Lohse, Kathleen A.; Baldock, Jeffrey A.; Amundson, Ronald			Linking soils and streams: Sources and chemistry of dissolved organic matter in a small coastal watershed	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												To understand the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the age and recalcitrance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) found in stream waters, we combined hydrometric monitoring along a topographic gradient from ridge to channel with isotopic (C-13 and C-14) and spectroscopic (UV and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance) analyses of soil and stream water samples in a small coastal watershed in California. With increasing discharge, dissolved organic carbon concentrations increased from 2.2 to 10.9 mg C L-1, Delta C-14 values increased from -125 to +120 parts per thousand, delta C-13 values decreased from -24 to -29 parts per thousand, C:N ratios increased from 6.5 to 15.4, and specific UV adsorption increased from 1.4 to 3.8 L mg C-1 m(-1). These changes in DOM composition are consistent with a shift in source from old and recalcitrant soil organic matter (OM) sources found in deep soil horizons to young and relatively fresh OM sources found in the surface horizons. Results from this study suggest upland soils of the watershed become DOM production limited as indicated by a seasonal depletion and chemical shift in soil DOM, whereas highly productive soils in the hollow act as a near-infinite DOM source. Hydrologic connectivity of this DOM-rich riparian source region to the stream ultimately constrains DOM export, and the stream DOM composition reflects the combined influence of soil biogeochemical cycling of OM and hydrologic routing of water through the landscape.

Changes in the concentration, biodegradability, and fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter during stormflows in coastal temperate watersheds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport during storms is studied because it is important in the annual watershed export budget for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We sampled stream water from two watersheds (upland and wetland-dominated) and three subcatchments (bog, forested wetland, and mineral forest) located within the wetland-dominated watershed during a fall and summer storm to investigate changes in the magnitude and chemical quality of DOM during stormflows. Stormflow export of DOC ranged from 2.3 kg C ha(-1) in the upland watershed to 13.9 kg C ha(-1) in the bog subcatchment. Biodegradable DOC (BDOC) export for these same storms ranged from 0.6 kg C ha(-1) in the upland watershed to 4.2 kg C ha(-1) in the bog subcatchment. The percent BDOC decreased during both storms in the upland watershed, while percent BDOC increased in the three wetland streams. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices further showed that as stream water DOM concentrations increased during stormflows in the upland watershed, the contribution of protein-like fluorescence decreased and humic-like fluorescence increased. However, the contribution of protein-like fluorescence increased and humic-like fluorescence decreased slightly in the three wetland streams. These results indicate that shifts in the biodegradability and chemical quality of DOM are different for upland and wetland watersheds. Taken together, our findings suggest stormflows are responsible for substantial export of BDOC from coastal temperate watersheds. Moreover, we found that PARAFAC modeling of fluorescent DOM is an effective tool for elucidating shifts in the quality of stream water DOM during storms.																	0148-0227					MAR 20	2009	114								G01021	10.1029/2008JG000790						WOS:000264439900001

Utilizing chromophoric dissolved organic matter measurements to derive export and reactivity of dissolved organic carbon exported to the Arctic Ocean: A case study of the Yukon River, Alaska	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The quality and quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported by Arctic rivers is known to vary with hydrology and this exported material plays a fundamental role in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon at high latitudes. We highlight the potential of optical measurements to examine DOM quality across the hydrograph in Arctic rivers. Furthermore, we establish chromophoric DOM (CDOM) relationships to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and lignin phenols in the Yukon River and model DOC and lignin loads from CDOM measurements, the former in excellent agreement with long-term DOC monitoring data. Intensive sampling across the historically under-sampled spring flush period highlights the importance of this time for total export of DOC and particularly lignin. Calculated riverine DOC loads to the Arctic Ocean show an increase from previous estimates, especially when new higher discharge data are incorporated. Increased DOC loads indicate decreased residence times for terrigenous DOM in the Arctic Ocean with important implications for the reactivity and export of this material to the Atlantic Ocean.

J	Lapierre, JF; Frenette, JJ				Lapierre, Jean-Francois; Frenette, Jean-Jacques			Effects of macrophytes and terrestrial inputs on fluorescent dissolved organic matter in a large river system	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We studied the contribution of aquatic macrophytes and allochthonous sources to the pool of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in a large river system composed of several distinct water masses that flow alongside one another in the same riverbed. Using three dimensional fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), we characterized FDOM found in the St. Lawrence River (Lake Saint-Pierre, Qu,bec, Canada), and from macrophyte leaching experiments. Eight fluorescent components were identified, three of which were dominant in macrophyte experiments and were similar to protein-like, autochthonous fluorophores identified in previous studies. The remaining components corresponded to humic and fulvic acids, and a principal component analysis revealed that their distribution in Lake Saint-Pierre was different than that of protein-like fluorophores, suggesting a different origin. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were strongly associated with the distribution of the allochthonous components. The distribution of protein-like FDOM in Lake Saint-Pierre matched that of macrophytes in the lake and the abundance of allochthonous FDOM was explained by the connectivity with the terrestrial ecosystem. Nearshore water masses carrying large loads of newly imported organic matter from proximal tributaries showed the maximum abundances and the older water masses, from the center of the lake, carried smaller quantities of terrestrial organic matter, thus originated mainly from Lake Ontario, several hundred kilometers upstream of Lake Saint-Pierre. This study demonstrates that macrophytes are a net source of protein-like FDOM and could represent an important supply of autochthonous DOM in shallow, productive environments.

DOM in groundwater can undergo significant irradiation when drawn to the surface for agricultural purposes. DOM was generally photostable in lake and photolabile in groundwater, with a more elevated rate constant of DOM disappearance in groundwater samples with higher Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC). DOM in lake water became photolabile upon acidification. The parallel decrease of both Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and NPOC suggests that actual photomineralisation took place in the samples. The (OH)-O-aEuro cent radicals play a secondary role into DOM photomineralisation in lake water, despite the fact that their generation rate considerably increases at acidic pH. The role of (OH)-O-aEuro cent is also minor in the photomineralisation of DOM contained in nitrate-rich groundwater.

Nevertheless, little information is available on the interactions between DOM and other foulants such as inorganic scale. This study sought to gain a fundamental understanding of the complicated fouling phenomenon by scale formation in the presence of DOM. Experimental studies with model solutions were conducted in a small batch filtration device. Humic acid and calcium sulfate were used as model DOM and scale-forming salts. The fouling of RO/NF membranes by scale formation was observed to be greatly affected by DOM and there appeared to be a strong link between the rate of fouling and DOM concentrations. Although DOM itself is a foulant to membranes, it acted like an antiscalant to lessen fouling due to scale formation. It is likely that the adsorption of DOM on crystal-growing sites on membranes as well as crystal surfaces diminished the sites for crystal growth and subsequently retarded the rate of crystallization. linage analysis of crystal particles grown in the presence of DOM also supported this hypothesis.																	0011-9164					MAR	2009	238	1-3					109	116		10.1016/j.desal.2008.01.041						WOS:000263920000013

Facilitated Transport of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers by Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The exchange rate of hydrophobic organic chemicals between the aqueous phase and a sorbant (e.g., soil, organism, passive sampler) is relevant for distribution processes between environmental compartments, including organisms. Dissolved phases such as humic acids, proteins, and surfactants can affect the transfer of such chemicals between the aqueous and sorbent phases by sorption and desorption processes. In this study, the desorption of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers from a polymer phase to an aqueous medium was monitored at different humic acid concentrations. The rate of release of the chemical by the polymer phase demonstrates that the chemical sorbed to dissolved humic acid contributed significantly to the total mass transfer when the affinity for the humic acid was sufficiently high. This illustrates that environmentally relevant humic acid concentrations can facilitate transport of hydrophobic organic chemicals, The consequences of these facilitated transport mechanisms for uptake into passive samplers are discussed, in particular in situations where equilibration is very slow or when exposure varies in time or space.																	0013-936X					MAR 1	2009	43	5					1379	1385		10.1021/es802403v						WOS:000263758600027	19350907

A.; Chanton, Jeffrey			Tidal pumping drives nutrient and dissolved organic matter dynamics in a Gulf of Mexico subterranean estuary	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We hypothesize that nutrient cycling in a Gulf of Mexico subterranean estuary (STE) is fueled by oxygen and labile organic matter supplied by tidal pumping of seawater into the coastal aquifer. We estimate nutrient production rates using the standard estuarine model and a non-steady-state box model, separate nutrient fluxes associated with fresh and saline submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), and estimate offshore fluxes from radium isotope distributions. The results indicate a large variability in nutrient concentrations over tidal and seasonal time scales. At high tide, nutrient concentrations in shallow beach groundwater were low as a result of dilution caused by seawater recirculation. During ebb tide, the concentrations increased until they reached a maximum just before the next high tide. The dominant form of nitrogen was dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in freshwater, nitrate in brackish waters, and ammonium in saline waters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production was two-fold higher in the summer than in the winter, while nitrate and DON production were one order of magnitude higher. Oxic remineralization and denitrification most likely explain these patterns. Even though fresh SGD accounted for only similar to 5% of total volumetric additions, it was an important pathway of nutrients as a result of biogeochemical inputs in the mixing zone. Fresh SGD transported similar to 25%, of DOC and similar to 50% of total dissolved nitrogen inputs into the coastal ocean, with the remainder associated with a one-dimensional vertical seawater exchange process. While SGD volumetric inputs are similar seasonally, changes in the biogeochemical conditions of this coastal plain STE led to higher summertime SGD nutrient fluxes (40%, higher for DOC and 60% higher for nitrogen in the summer compared to the winter). We suggest that coastal primary production and nutrient dynamics in the STE are linked. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compared with the common methods where a single slope of CDOM absorption spectrum is determined over a broad spectral region, we estimate the variations in spectral slope as a function of wavelength from 200 to 700 nm. Hence, our results show a distribution of spectral slope, referred to as the spectral slope curve, S(lambda), which was used to identify similarities between lakes and standard solutions as well as to show the wavelength intervals in which photodegradation modifies spectral slope. In contrast to the plethora of wavelength intervals and ratios presented in the CDOM literature, a comparison of spectral slope curves between ecosystems provides a potentially important tool to examine the characteristics of CDOM in a consistent manner.

J	Yamashita, Y; Tanoue, E				Yamashita, Youhei; Tanoue, Eiichiro			Basin scale distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Pacific Ocean	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was surveyed along the 160 degrees W transect from the equatorial to the subarctic Pacific. CDOM characteristics were evaluated through the measurement of fluorescence intensity at 320 nm excitation and 420 nm emission and of absorption coefficient (a) at 320 nm, both indicative of marine humic-like CDOM. In the surface layer (similar to 200 m), different levels but similar optical characteristics of CDOM were found among the oceanic regions studied. In the mesopelagic (200-1000 m) and abyssal layers (1000 m-bottom), levels of fluorescence intensities were linearly correlated to those of absorption coefficients, with a similar slope between these layers. However, the intercept of the linear relationship between the two optical parameters was significantly lower for the mesopelagic layer than for the abyssal layer. Differences between intercepts were consistent with the transport of optically distinct CDOM to the mesopelagic layer through the formation of the North Pacific intermediate water (NPIW). At wavelengths shorter than 300 nm, the absorption coefficients of CDOM in the surface layer systematically deviated from the natural logarithmic relationships between absorption coefficients and wavelengths in the 320-350 nm range. This class of CDOM, estimated using absorption coefficient at 275 nm, was defined as surface-specific CDOM and may be derived from biocomponents. Surface-specific CDOM was higher in the relatively young mode water than in old NPIW, suggesting that this class of CDOM is semi-labile.

Complexing affinities of the so concentrated marine dissolved NOM (DNOM) towards major and trace cations were studied by potentiometric and voltammetric titration techniques. The potentiometric titration experiments fitted by models describing and characterising the DNOM-cation interactions, revealed four distinct classes of acidic sites (pKa of 3.6, 4.8, 8.6 and 12). A total acidic sites density of 445 meq/mol(C) was estimated, with a majority (60%) of carboxylic-like sites. Pseudopolarographic measurements revealed two distinct groups of copper complexes: labile, reducible at about -0.2 V; and inert, directly reducible at about -1.4 V. Simultaneous competition between copper, calcium and proton highlighted the presence of two classes of binding sites (density of 1.72 and 10.25 meq mol(C)(-1), respectively, corresponding to 3% of total acidic sites). The first class was more specific to copper (log K(CuL) 9-9, logK(CaL) 2.5, pKa 8.6), whereas stronger competition between copper and calcium occurred for the second class (log K(CuL) 6.9, log K(CaL) 5.5, pKa 8.2). The binding sites characterisation was validated by the very good matching of the non-concentrated seawater sample titration data with the simulated curves obtained using the binding parameters from the concentrated sample. Furthermore, this comparison also validated the applied preconcentration protocol, highlighting its negligible influence on organic matter properties when considering copper complexation.

However, if it was just this, life as we know it would not exist. In addition to this inorganic component, at least tens of thousands of organic molecules - collectively known as dissolved organic matter - exist in picomole amounts in each litre of sea water. Dissolved organic matter is important for aquatic food webs and, integrated over the entire volume of the world's oceans, contains roughly as much carbon as all living biota on land and in the ocean combined. Yet, the cycling of dissolved organic matter in the ocean is not well understood. Recent progress in analytical chemistry has allowed the characterization of dissolved organic matter at the molecular level in unprecedented detail, revealing that a significant proportion has been thermally altered, either in deep sediments or through combustion on land with later delivery to the sea. Thermal alteration may explain, at least in part, the resistance of oceanic dissolved organic matter to microbial decomposition.

J	Davis, J; Kaiser, K; Benner, R				Davis, Jenny; Kaiser, Karl; Benner, Ronald			Amino acid and amino sugar yields and compositions as indicators of dissolved organic matter diagenesis	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Microbial decomposition experiments were used to characterize changes in the amino acid and amino sugar yields and compositions of natural marine substrates during early diagenesis in seawater. On average, 63% of added carbon and 68% of added nitrogen were removed within the first 30 days of decomposition. In all cases, amino acid utilization accounted for a substantial fraction of the removed C and N. Carbon-normalized amino acid yields decreased to less than 50% of their starting values and most of this change occurred within the first 10 days of decomposition. Increases in the concentrations of amino sugars and decreases in the GIcN:GalN ratio in particulate organic matter (POM) illustrated the significance of microbial production during the decomposition of added substrates. Changes in the mol % composition of amino acids during early diagenesis were substantial but highly variable with Substrate. Previous survey data collected from the same region were used in conjunction with the experimental data to investigate the utility of several established amino acid-based indices of organic matter diagenesis. This comparison showed that a combination of these degradation indexes is most effective for describing the diagenetic state of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Carbon-normalized amino acid yields were found to be the most effective indicator for early diagenesis. Relative abundances of amino acids were effective indicators of intermediate stages of diagenesis and the mol % composition of the non-protein amino acid gamma-Aba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) was an effective indicator of advanced DOM diagenesis.

We present a data-set including catchments from four areas covering the major climate and land use gradients within Europe: a forested boreal zone (Finland), a temperate agricultural area (Denmark), a wet and temperate mountain region in Wales, and a warm Mediterranean catchment draining into the Gulf of Lyon. In all study areas, DOC (dissolved organic carbon) was a major fraction of DOM, with much lower proportions of DON (dissolved organic nitrogen) and DOP (dissolved organic phosphorus). A south-north gradient with highest DOC concentrations and export in the northernmost catchments was recorded: DOC concentrations and loads were highest in Finland and lowest in France. These relationships indicate that DOC concentrations/export are controlled by several factors including wetland and forest cover, precipitation and hydrological processes. DON concentrations and loads were highest in the Danish catchments and lowest in the French catchments. In Wales and Finland, DON concentrations increased with the increasing proportion of agricultural land in the catchment, whereas in Denmark and France no such relationship was found. DOP concentrations and loads were low compared to DOC and DON. The highest DOP concentrations and loads were recorded in catchments with a high extent of agricultural land, large urban areas or a high population density, reflecting the influence of human impact on DOP loads.

The results showed that the DOM production from straw decay decreased initially, then increased linearly as a function of time, and finally leveled off beyond 63 days. The biodegradation rates of DOM harvested at different decay times were adequately quantified using a two-compartment kinetics equation. The model fitting results showed that the relative content of the biologically resistant DOM fraction increased front 7% in the DOM obtained at Day 0 of decay to about 63% in the DOM at Day 180 of decay. The half lives of the labile and the resistant DOM fractions were 1.22 to 3.07 days and 36 to 630 days, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectra, (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicated that carbohydrates may be the major components of the labile DOM fraction, and that lignin-derived aromatic organic compounds may be the major components of the resistant DOM fraction. The increased resistance of DOM to further biodegradation may suggest enhanced carbon sequestration in soils.																	0038-075X					MAR	2009	174	3					143	150		10.1097/SS.0b013e31819c6e35						WOS:000264311500003

It was found that humic substances (HA and FA) composed 75% of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of the DOM, with an average molecular weight of about 1000 Da. Elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy and acid-base titration observations showed that the HA and FA of the DOM exhibited lower fractions of condensed aromatic functional groups but larger fractions of acidic groups compared with other aquatic DOMs. The properties of HA and FA were similar, but HA exhibited more complete humification, while the Hyl fraction had more acidic groups. An aminated polymeric adsorbent NDA-8 was used to adsorb the DOM in the wastewater along with primary coagulation. Results of bench-scale experiments indicated that the treatment process could effectively remove the DOM and heavy metals while desorption liquid was 10 times more condensed than raw wastewater, Results of desorption and reproducibility tests consolidated the strong application potential of this treatment process as an advanced landfill leachate treatment technology.

The humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA) and hydrophilic (HyI) were isolated and purified by the XAD-8 resin combined with the cation exchange resin method. The analytical results of fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) revealed that the fluorescence peaks were protein-like fluorescence for equalization basin and discharge of reverse osmosis (RO), while the fluorescence peaks for second sedimentation tank were humic-like and fulvic-like fluorescence. Moreover, the results also showed that protein-like organic matter are readily removed by biological process and HA and FA can be removed by RO process. Elemental analysis indicated that the nitrogen content in these isolated fractions followed: HA > HyI > FA. The information on the characteristics of DOM indicated important role in optimization of leachate treatment processes.

Water samples were collected during a 3.5 year period, from October 2001 until March 2005, in the vicinity of the Cape Fear River (CFR) outlet and in adjacent Onslow Bay (OB). During this study there were two divergent hydrological and meteorological conditions in the CFR drainage area: a severe drought in 2002, followed by the very wet year of 2003. CDOM was characterized optically by the absorption coefficient at 350 rim, the spectral slope coefficient (S), and by Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) fluorescence. Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was used to assess CDOM composition from EEM spectra and six components were identified: three terrestrial humic-like components, one marine humic-like component and two protein-like components. Terrestrial humic-like components contributed most to dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence in the low salinity plume of the CFR. The contribution of terrestrial humic-like components to DOM fluorescence in OB was much smaller than in the CFR plume area. Protein-like components contributed significantly to DOM fluorescence in the coastal ocean of OB and they dominated DOM fluorescence in the Gulf Stream waters. Hydrological conditions during the observation period significantly impacted both concentration and composition of CDOM found in the estuary and coastal ocean. In the CFR plume, there was an order of magnitude difference in CDOM absorption and fluorescence intensity between samples collected during the drought compared to the wet period. During the drought, CDOM in the CFR plume was composed of equal proportions of terrestrial humic-like components (ca. 60% of the total fluorescence intensity) with a significant contribution of proteinaceous substances (ca. 20% of the total fluorescence). During high river flow, CDOM was composed mostly of humic substances (nearly 75% of total fluorescence) with minor contributions by proteinaceous substances. The impact of changes in fresh water discharge patterns on CDOM concentration and composition was also observed in OB, though to a lesser degree. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bioavailability and bacterial degradation rates of dissolved organic matter in a temperate coastal area during an annual cycle	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The bioavailability and bacterial degradation rates of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were determined over a seasonal cycle in Loch Cretan (Scotland) by measuring the decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorous (DOP) concentrations during long-term laboratory incubations (150 days) at a constant temperature of 14 degrees C. The experiments showed that bioavailable DOC (BDOC) accounted for 29 +/- 11% of DOC (average SD). bioavailable DON (BDON) for 52 +/- 11% of DON and bioavailable DOP (BDOP) for 88 8% of DOP. The seasonal variations in DOM concentrations were mainly due to the bioavailable fraction. BDOP was degraded at a rate of 12 +/- 4% d(-1) (average +/- SD) while the degradation rates of BDOC and BDON were 7 +/- 2% d(-1) and 9 +/- 2% d(-1) respectively, indicating a preferential mineralization of DOP relative to DON and of DON relative to DOC. Positive correlations between concentration and degradation rate of DOM suggested that the higher the concentration the faster DOM would be degraded. On average, 77 +/- 9% of BDOR 62 +/- 14% of BDON and 49 +/- 19% of BDOC were mineralized during the residence time of water in Loch Creran, showing that this coastal area exported C-rich DOM to the adjacent Firth of Lorne. Four additional degradation experiments testing the effect of varying temperature on bioavailability and degradation rates of DOM were also conducted throughout the seasonal cycle (summer, autumn, winter and spring). Apart from the standard incubations at 14 degrees C, additional studies at 8 degrees C and 18 degrees C were also conducted. Bioavailability did not change with temperature, but degradation rates were stimulated by increased temperature, with a Q(10) of 2.6 +/- 1.1 for DOC and 2.5 +/- 0.7 for DON (average +/- SD).

In this study, fulvic acid, tannin, aniline, citric acid, polysucrose and oligopeptide were selected to represent fractions of DOM with different hydrophobicity and acid/base properties. The impact of each model compound as well as their mixture on the fouling and cleaning behavior of a modified polyvinyl chloride UF membrane was investigated. The results show that the interplay of molecular size/structure, charge, hydrophobicity, and functionality determines the membrane rejection and fouling potential of individual DOM compounds, although rejection is not directly related to the fouling potential. Furthermore, the overall fouling and cleaning behavior of DOM mixtures, e.g., natural water, cannot be simply predicted from fouling behavior of individual DOM compounds. Significant synergy exists presumably due to interactions between DOM compounds, leading to significantly greater fouling rate compared to the additive sum of contributions from individual DOM compounds.

Spectroscopic characterization of dissolved organic matter isolated from rainwater	CHEMOSPHERE												Rainwater is a matrix containing extremely low concentrations (in the range of mu M C) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and for its characterization, an efficient extraction procedure is essential. A recently developed procedure based on adsorption onto XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins in series was used in this work for the extraction and isolation of rainwater dissolved organic matter (DOM). Prior to the isolation and fractionation of DOM, and to obtain sufficient mass for the spectroscopic analyses, individual rainwater samples were batched together according to similar meteorological conditions on a total of three composed samples. The results of the isolation procedure indicated that the resin tandem procedure is not applicable for rainwater DOM since the XAD-4 resin caused samples contamination. On the other hand, the XAD-8 resin allowed DOM recoveries of 39.9-50.5% of the DOC of the original combined samples. This recovered organic fraction was characterized by UV-visible. molecular fluorescence, FTIR-ATR and (1)H NMR spectroscopies. The chemical characterization of the rainwater DOM showed that the three samples consist mostly of hydroxylated and carboxylic acids with a predominantly aliphatic character, containing a minor component of aromatic structures. The obtained results suggest that the DOM in rainwater, and consequently in the precursor atmospheric particles, may have a secondary origin via the oxidation of volatile organic compounds from different origins.

The growth of algae was gradually increased on the addition of dissolved organic ligands, but markedly declined at high concentrations, due to reduced bioavailable iron concentrations (e.g., Fe3+ and Fe'-inorganic ferric iron). The results demonstrated that the high growth rates of P. subcapitata were correlated with the hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, DOM from five lakes, spiked under the nutrients-controlled conditions. This was attributed to the role of DOM in controlling the bioavailable iron due to complexation of Fe(III) with -COOH and -OH functional groups on the hydrophobic DOM. Therefore, the hydrophobic DOM, as chelating agent, is a biologically important component in the lake waters, which affects the algal growth by interacting with bioavailable iron in the lake water and can change the results of bioassay experiments.

Photochemically Induced Changes in Dissolved Organic Matter Identified by Ultrahigh Resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sunlight-induced molecular changes have been observed in two samples of dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected in the Cape Fear River system, North Carolina, USA. The molecular composition of a water sample collected in the Black River (sample B210, salinity 0) and another water sample collected within the Cape Fear River estuary (sample M61, salinity 13.7) were analyzed using an ultrahigh resolution 9.4 Tesla (T) electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Additionally, the Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/vis) absorbance as well as the excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra were determined to identify changes in the optical properties associated with photochemical reactions of the chromophoric DOM (CDOM). The molecular formulas for the Cape Fear River Estuary(M61) sample before the irradiation experiments indicated the presence of highly aromatic compounds which were not present in the unirradiated Black River sample (B210). These aromatic compounds,with oxygen-subtracted double bond equivalents (DBE-0) values greater than nine, are more photoreactive and readily photodegraded relative to saturated compounds. Compounds with DBE-O values below nine are less photoreactive. The UV/vis absorbance and EEM fluorescence results supported this different photodegradation behavior, suggesting that the photoreactivity of CDOM is highly dependent on the molecular composition of the CDOM.

J	Bauer, M; Blodau, C				Bauer, Markus; Blodau, Christian			Arsenic distribution in the dissolved, colloidal and particulate size fraction of experimental solutions rich in dissolved organic matter and ferric iron	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Due to the widespread contamination of groundwater resources with arsenic (As), controls on As mobility have to be identified. In this study we focused on the distribution of As in the dissolved, colloidal and particulate size fraction of experimental solutions rich in ferric iron, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and As(V). Size fractions between <5 kDa and >0.2 mu m were separated by filtration and their elemental composition was analyzed. A steady-state particle size distribution with stable element concentration in the different size classes was attained within 24 h. The presence of DOM partly inhibited the formation of large Fe-(oxy)hydroxide aggregates, thus stabilized Fe in complexed and colloidal form, when initially adjusted molar Fe/C ratios in solution were <0.1. Dissolved As concentrations and the quantity of As bound to colloids (<0.2 mu m) increased in the presence of DOM as well. At intermediate Fe/C ratios of 0.02-0.1, a strong correlation between As and Fe concentration occurred in all size fractions (R(2) = 0.989). At Fe/C ratios <0.02, As was mainly present in the dissolved size fraction. These observations indicate that As mobility increased in the presence of DOM due to (1) competition between As and organic molecules for sorption sites on Fe particles-, and (11) due to a higher amount of As bound to more abundant Fe colloids or complexes <0.2 mu m in size. The amount of As contained in the colloidal size fractions also depended strongly oil the initial size of the humic substance, which was larger for purified humic acids than for natural river or soil porewater samples. Arsenic in the particle size fraction >0.2 mu m additionally decreased in the order of pH 4 >> 6 > 8. The presence of DOM likely increases the mobility of As in iron rich waters undergoing oxidation, a finding that has to be considered in the investigation of organic-rich terrestrial and aquatic environments.

Effects of nutrients and dissolved organic matter on the response of phytoplankton to ultraviolet radiation: experimental comparison in spring versus summer	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effects of nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the response of phytoplankton community structure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was studied using natural phytoplankton assemblages from Lake Giles (Northeastern Pennsylvania), a temperate, oligotrophic, highly UVR-transparent lake. Microcosm experiments were conducted in 1-l bags in the spring and summer. A factorial design was used, with two UVR treatments (ambient and reduced), two nutrient treatments (control with no nutrients added, and nitrogen and phosphorus addition together), and two DOM treatments (control of 1 mg l(-1) and doubled). In April, UVR affected the overall phytoplankton community structure, causing a shift in the dominant species. Significant interactive effects of UVR x nutrients and UVR x DOM were found on total phytoplankton biovolumes. In July, all taxa responded positively to the N + P addition, and were affected differentially by the UVR treatments. The initial communities varied in April and July, but Synura sp. and Chroomonas sp. were present in both seasons. Synura sp. responded positively to the addition of DOM in April and the reduction of UVR in July. Chroomonas sp. responded positively to the reduction of UVR in April and the addition of nutrients in July. The differential sensitivity of these two species suggests that changing environmental factors between spring and summer promoted differences in the relative importance of UVR in changing phytoplankton community structure.																	0018-8158					FEB	2009	619						155	166		10.1007/s10750-008-9608-5						WOS:000261751000012

Photodegradation of estuarine dissolved organic matter: a multi-method assessment of DOM transformation	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												A multi method approach was applied to Study changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) at three estuarine sites with varying salinity, as well as changes resulting from experimental photodegradation. Following measurement of ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra of bulk samples, DOM was isolated using C(18) solid phase extraction. The extract was characterized using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) and molecular level characterization was conducted via direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The molecular weight distribution of DOM as determined from HP-SEC and ESI-MS varied between techniques, but generally decreased down estuary and with photodegradation for both approaches. Relative differences in molecular weight were significantly correlated with the ratio of absorption coefficients at 2541365 nm. Additionally, photobleaching was significantly correlated with mass spectral characteristics from both DT-MS and ESI-MS. Principal component analysis of DT-MS spectra showed that photo-exposure removed different mass spectral characteristics depending on sampling site: however, upon photodegradation, the mass spectral characteristics of both marine DOM and terrestrially dominated DOM approached a common spectrum, We interpret this spectrum, characterized by fragments from aromatic and carbohydrate-like precursors, as photochemically refractory DOM. Our results show that multiple approaches that characterize different aspects of DOM can provide complementary information about its sources and transformation. More specifically, photobleaching results in decreased light absorbance, decreased molecular weight and shifts in the relative abundance of classes of compounds (and broad shifts in m/z values); moreover, these transformations result in photodegraded samples from a low-salinity site which are compositionally similar to samples collected from a mid-salinity site further downstream.

Metal leaching from MSWI bottom ash as affected by salt or dissolved organic matter	WASTE MANAGEMENT					5th Asian-Pacific Landfill Symposium	OCT 22-24, 2008	Sapporo, JAPAN					In order to manage municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash safely, risk assessments, including the prediction of leaching under different field conditions, are necessary. In this study, the influence of salt or dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the influent on metal leaching from MSWI bottom ash was investigated in a column experiment. The presence of salt (0.1 M NaCI) resulted in a small increase of As leaching, whereas no impact on leachate concentration was found when lakewater DOM (35.1 mg/I dissolved organic carbon) was added. Most of the added DOM was retained within the material. Further, X-ray spectroscopy revealed that Cu(II) was the dominating form of Cu and that it probably Occurred as a CuO-type mineral. The CU(2+) activity in the MSWI bottom ash leachate was most likely determined by the dissolution of CuO together with the formation of Cu-DOM complexes and possibly also by adsorption to (hydr)oxide minerals. The addition of lake DOM in the influent resulted in lower saturation indices for CuO in the leachates. which may be due to slow CuO dissolution kinetics in combination with strong Cu-DOM complexation.

J	Lin, CF; Lin, AYC; Chandana, PS; Tsai, CY				Lin, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Angela Yu-Chen; Chandana, Panchangam Sri; Tsai, Chao-Yuan			Effects of mass retention of dissolved organic matter and membrane pore size on membrane fouling and flux decline	WATER RESEARCH												Ultrafiltration (UF) fouling has been attributed to concentration polarization, gel layer formation as well as outer and inner membrane pore clogging. It is believed that mass of humic materials either retained on membrane surface or associated with membrane inner pore surface is the primary cause for permeate flux decline and filtration resistance buildup in water supply industries. While biofilm/biofouling and inorganic matter could also be contributing factors for permeability decline in wastewater treatment practices. The present study relates UF fouling to mass of dissolved organic matter (DOM) retained on membrane and quantifies the effect of retained DOM mass on filtration flux decline. The results demonstrate that larger pore membranes exhibit significant flux decline in comparison with the smaller ones. During a 24-h period, dissolved organic carbon mass retained in 10 kDa membranes was about 1.0 gm(-2) and that in 100 kDa membranes was more than 3 times higher (3.6 gm(-2)). The accumulation of retained DOM mass significantly affects permeate flux. it is highly likely that some DOMs bind or aggregate together to form surface gel layer in the smaller 10 kDa UF system; those DOMs largely present in inner pore and serving as pore blockage on a loose membrane (100 kDa) are responsible for severe flux decline.

To determine the biological transformation of DOM, biodegradability tests using a biodegradation-column system were conducted. DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into S fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was removed by 70% during SAT, and the sorption and anaerobic biodegradation in SAT led to a DOC reduction of 27.4%. The significant changes in fluorescence properties of DOM were observed during SAT. However, the sorption and anaerobic biodegradation in SAT seemed to have no significant effect on the chemical structure of fluorescing constituents in DOM. The DOM fractions exhibited different changes in Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra characteristics during SAT. Biodegradation resulted in the enrichment of aromatic structures and the decreased content of the oxygen-containing functional groups, such as C=O and C-O, in DOM. On the other hand, the production of G-O and amide-2 functional groups occurred as a result of the sorption combined with anaerobic biodegradation in SAT. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Atrazine removal from water by polycation-clay composites: Effect of dissolved organic matter and comparison to activated carbon	WATER RESEARCH												Atrazine removal from water by two polycations pre-adsorbed on montmorillonite was studied, Batch experiments demonstrated that the most suitable composite poly (4-vinylpyridine-co-styrene)-montmorillonite (PVP-co-S90%-mont.) removed 90-99% of atrazine (0.5-28 ppm) within 20-40 min at 0.367% w/w. Calculations employing Langmuir's equation could simulate and predict the kinetics and final extents of atrazine adsorption. Column filter experiments (columns 20 x 1.6 cm) which included 2 g of the PVP-co-S90%-mont. composite mixed with excess sand removed 93-96% of atrazine (800 ppb) for the first 800 pore volumes, whereas the same amount of granular activated carbon (GAC) removed 83-75%. In the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM; 3.7 ppm) the efficiency of the GAC filter to remove atrazine decreased significantly (68-52% removal), whereas the corresponding efficiency of the PVP-co-S90%-mont. filter was only slightly influenced by DOM. At lower atrazine concentration (7 ppb) the PVP-co-S90%-mont. filter reduced even after 3000 pore volumes the emerging atrazine concentration below 3 ppb (USEPA standard). in the case of the GAC filter the emerging atrazine concentration was between 2.4 and 5.3 mu g/L even for the first 100 pore volumes. Thus, the PVP-co-S90%-mont. composite is a new efficient material for the removal of atrazine from water. (C)2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In spring, without any addition of NO(3)(-), the exposure of 0.2 mu m filtered seawater (DOM-solution) to natural solar radiation (i.e. Full Sun [FS], including photosynthetically available [PAR: 400-700 nm], ultraviolet-A [UVAR: 315-400 nm] and ultraviolet-B [UVBR: 280-315 nm] radiations) stimulated bacterial production (BP) and abundance (BA) in natural assemblages (0.8 mu m filtered seawater) by 80 and 20% as compared to unexposed (Dark) DOM-solutions, respectively. This stimulation resulted primarily from the exposure to PAR. When NO(3) (30 mu M) was added to DOM-solution before irradiation, BP and BA increased by 150 and 65% in FS compared to Dark, respectively, due to both PAR and UVBR. By contrast, in Summer, the exposure of DOM-solution caused a decrease in BP by 30% but an increase in BA by 23% in FS compared to Dark, regardless of the NO(3)(-) addition before irradiation. The inhibition of BP resulted mainly from UVAR, whereas the stimulation or BA resulted from PAR. These results Suggest contrasting effects along seasons of solar radiation and NO(3)(-) on DOM bioavailability, depending on its initial chemical composition. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Isotopic tracers are important tools that can help to unravel the source of DOM from different terrestrial compartments in the landscape. Here we demonstrate the spatial and seasonal variation of delta S-34 of DOM in 70 boreal streams to test if the tracer could provide new insights into the origin of DOM. We found large spatial and seasonal variations in stream water delta S-34-DOM values ranging from -5.2 parts per thousand to + 9.6 parts per thousand with an average of +4.0 +/- 0.6 (N=62; average and 95% confidence interval). Large seasonal variations were found in stream water delta S-34-DOM values: for example, a shift of more than 10 parts per thousand during the spring snowmelt in a wetland-dominated stream. Spatial differences were also observed during the winter base flow with higher delta S-34-DOM values in the fourth-order Krycklan stream at the outlet of the 68 km(2) compared to the small (<1 km(2)) headwater streams. Our data clearly show that the delta S-34-DOM values have the potential to be used as a tracer to identify and generate new insights about terrestrial DOM sources in the boreal landscape.

J	Day, DA; Faloona, I				Day, Douglas A.; Faloona, Ian			Carbon monoxide and chromophoric dissolved organic matter cycles in the shelf waters of the northern California upwelling system	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												An annual program of approximately bimonthly seawater sampling was conducted off the coast of the Bodega Marine Laboratory in the California Current upwelling system (CCUS) to investigate controls on dissolved carbon monoxide ( CO) and its photochemical parent, chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( CDOM). A diel steady state model was developed to quantify CO sources and sinks throughout the day. Observed midday CO spanned 2.7-17 nmol L-1, and correlated strongly with coincident CDOM absorption; however, rapid microbial consumption rates (0.05-0.80 h(-1)) were such that similar to 95% of the CO generated was metabolized within the ocean surface. Further indication of the dominant influence of the microbial ecosystem was the persistent observation of a strong "dark production,'' which contributed similar to 25% of the diurnal source strength within the top 17 m of the ocean. The dark source correlated strongly with biological oxidation rates and CDOM, suggesting that it is the result of incomplete respiration of biologically labile DOM. CDOM was lowest in recently upwelled waters, implying that its origin is from the induced primary production and not from shelf sediment resuspension. The estimated CO air-sea flux was highly variable ( average of 5 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)), and most likely inconsequential to the atmospheric budget in coastal regions. The photolytic source strength of CO2 from CDOM (2.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was estimated by scaling to modeled CO photoproduction rates. This photolytic remineralization rate represents similar to 2.5% of the net primary production in the CCUS, implying that CDOM photobleaching may play a significant role in the carbon cycling of upwelling systems.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JAN 13	2009	114								C01006	10.1029/2007JC004590						WOS:000262628700001

The results demonstrate that multivariate analysis facilitates the complex data treatment and spectral sorting processes, and also enhances the probability to reveal otherwise hidden information concerning the chemical characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). The distribution of different water samples as revealed by multivariate results has been used to track the movement of DOM material in the study area, and the interpretation is supported by the results obtained from the numerical simulation model of substance tracing technique, which show that the substance discharged by Haibo River can be distributed in Jiaozhou Bay.																	0253-505X						2009	28	2					60	72								WOS:000266647100007

Some pitfalls in PAGE-LA-ICP-MS for quantitative elemental speciation of dissolved organic matter and metalomics	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY					4th International Conference on Trace Element Speciation in Biomedical, Nutritional and Environmental Sciences	MAY 25-29, 2008	Munich, GERMANY					An experimental approach to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for quantitative elemental speciation is presented. Two metalloproteins (superoxide dismutase, containing Cu and Zn, and thyroglobulin, containing I) with high binding affinity for metals, and metal-dissolved organic matter (DOM) complexes (from a compost leachate sample) which show different types of metal binding are studied. Iodine can be quantitatively detected in thyroglobulin after PAGE-LA-ICP-MS using either sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) PAGE or native PAGE. However, detection of Cu and Zn in superoxide dismutase after PAGE-LA-ICP-MS depends on the conditions of the PAGE method because possible metal losses can occur (either with SDS-PAGE or with native PAGE). The use of PAGE-LAICPMS to study the contribution of DOM to the mobilization of metals from environmental samples is possible, but it depends also on the PAGE separation conditions owing to disequilibrium effects of metal-DOM complexes.

J	Shimotori, K; Omori, Y; Hama, T				Shimotori, Koichi; Omori, Yuko; Hama, Takeo			Bacterial production of marine humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter and its biogeochemical importance	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacterial production of humic-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM(H)) was examined in a 90 d culture experiment using a bacterial assemblage collected from coastal water with artificial seawater amended by glucose. A rapid decrease in dissolved organic carbon concentration was noticed during Days 1 to 5, and this coincided with an increase in bacterial numbers. The increase in FDOM(H), which was determined by Excitation-Emission Matrix Spectroscopy (EEMS), was observed by Day 20, showing the production of FDOM(H) by bacteria. This increase lagged behind the increase in bacterial numbers, suggesting that the production of FDOM(H) was accompanied by an alteration of bacterial biomolecules. After Day 30, the fluorescence intensity showed no significant decrease, and 63% of the maximum intensity on Day 20 remained at the end of the experiment. This high remaining percentage likely reflects the recalcitrant properties of bacteria-derived FDOM(H) (BAC-FDOM(H)). High-performance size-exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detection (Excitation/Emission = 335/410 nm) revealed that most of BAC-FDOM(H) is composed of 3 molecular weight (MW) groups having similar fluorescent properties. The MWs of these were all <1.8 kDa relative to standards with known MW. A photodegradation experiment of BAC-FDOM(H) demonstrated that the photodegradability of fluorophores varied among the MW groups. Measurements of the MW composition of coastal seawater showed that a recalcitrant fraction of BAC-FDOM(H) resistant to solar irradiance constituted a part of FDOM(H) in ambient seawater.																	0948-3055						2009	58	1					55	66		10.3354/ame01350						WOS:000273539500005

Bacterial community composition and colored dissolved organic matter in a coastal upwelling ecosystem	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The aim of the present study was to correlate changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, as characterized through humic- and protein-like fluorescence, with changes in the abundance of major bacterial groups (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes) and bacterial activity in an upwelling system during the season of low productivity. Sampling was conducted under 2 contrasting periods characterized by low (February) and high (October) precipitation. In October, the mean humic-like DOM fluorescence in surface waters (3.1 ppb equivalents of quinine sulphate [ppb QS]) was higher than the annual average for this coastal zone (2.2 ppb QS), which was attributed to enhanced continental runoff. Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant groups, accounting for about 13 and 16% of total bacterial abundance, respectively. Betaproteobacteria were detectable only during the rainy period, accounting for 2 to 9% of total bacterial abundance. The bulk dissolved organic carbon concentration similarly explained the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (ca. 50% of total variability). By contrast, a strong correlation was found between the humic-like DOM fluorescence and the relative abundance of the Betaproteobacteria group, explaining 68% of the total variability. Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that the relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria has the greatest influence on bacterial carbon fluxes, explaining 61 and 65% of bulk bacterial activity and biomass variability, respectively. Despite their relatively low abundance, Betaproteobacteria might play a relevant biogeochemical role in this coastal transition ecosystem during the low productivity period as allochthonous DOM consumers.

A factorial discriminant analysis, performed using the parameters selected (ex/em pairs of wavelength), succeeded in a better discrimination of seasons than stations, and clearly showed the presence of two fluorophores. Fluorophore 1, with two absorption bands: ex=260-320nm and 330-390nm for em=440-500nm, and Fluorophore 2, with one absorption band: ex=300-360nm for em=410nm, which are attributed to humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA), respectively. Variations of DOM relative contents downstream in the River Tet, according to seasons and stations, showed high amounts of DOM (pedogenic character) along the river in the humid period, with the highest value obtained in the mountain section. In contrast, in summer, the DOM contents were low (aquagenic character). Moreover, DOM presents a relatively constant composition with a percentage of FA ranging from 40% at the mountain station to 48% at the mouth river, whatever the season.

Six fluorophores with multiple EEM peaks (fluorophore A-F) were identified based on the collected EEM spectra and validated by bi-variate analysis, principal component analysis, and parallel factor analysis, as follows (excitation wavelength Ex and emission wavelength Em): (Ex 240, 310, 360nm, Em 460 nm), (Ex 220, 280nm, Em 340 nm), (Ex 220,270 nm, Em 300 nm), (Ex 220,280nm, Em 360nm), (Ex 230,320 nm, Em 420 nm) and (Ex 220, 310 nm, Em 400 nm). The spectral characteristics of these fluorophores were discussed using fractional EEM and apparent molecular weight (AMW) data obtained via SEC analysis. The triple peak flurophore A was pointed at a hydrophobic acid or hydrophobic neutral compound with a pyrenyl functional group of AMW 2500-3500 Da, which displayed an excitation wavelength at 360nm and a fluorescence intensity ratio of 6.70(+/-1.79):1.70(+/-0.41):1 (fluorescent intensities of Ex 240:Ex 310:Ex 360nm at Ex: 460 nm). This compound is observed to be refractory in landfilling or in anoxic/aerobic treatments, and is specific to this leachate contamination. This paper revealed that the coupling of SEC and EEM can be useful to track the fluorescent DOM fraction in landfill leachate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

NO(2)(-) photodegradation was considerably faster in lake water compared with ultra-pure water. A key issue was the presence in lake water of hydroxyl radical ((center dot)OH) scavengers that inhibited the reaction between NO(2)(-) and (center dot)OH. Such a reaction, while causing additional NO(2)(-) transformation, produced nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)(center dot)) that was subsequently involved into the regeneration of NO(2)(-) by dimerisation or the reaction with nitric oxide (NO(center dot)). The scavenging of (center dot)OH by compounds different from NO(2)(-) (mainly dissolved organic matter, DOM) prevented the regeneration reactions from taking place, and enhanced the phototransformation of NO(2)(-). Model calculations for the direct photolysis of NO(2)(-), applied to the lake water samples, yielded a NO(2)(-) half-life time of around three weeks in the mixing layer of the lakes because of photodegradation. Therefore, we conclude that photodegradation is a potentially important process to control the concentration of NO(2)(-) in shallow lakes, or in deeper ones under stratification conditions.

Partial 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that over 80% of all the strains were highly similar to the Polynucleobacter cluster. Essential medium components for effective cultivation are pyruvate, yeast extract and peptone, whereas soluble starch and glucose are not necessary. Isolate KF001 (affiliated with Polynucleobacter subcluster D) has a strict requirement for organic acids as carbon sources, and we hypothesize that the Polynucleobacter cluster of bacteria could utilize compounds formed via photochemically dissolved organic matter (DOM) degradation for growth. Because organic acids form from solar radiation of DOM in aquatic environments, carbon sources that are typical products of DOM photochemical degradation were added to the medium. These compounds were readily utilized by KF001 in this study. Finally, we observed the stimulation of strain KF001 activity by photochemical degradation of natural lake water. Our findings suggest a carbon flow of DOM photoproducts to Polynucleobacter in the freshwater microbial loop.																	0168-6496					JAN	2009	67	1					57	68		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00606.x						WOS:000261622000006	19049496

CDOM regulates the penetration of UV light into the sea and therefore plays an important role in many hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the sea surface layer including primary productivity. In the framework ADRICOSM-STAR it was possible to investigate the Boka Kotorska Bay during May and June 2008 in order to increase an understanding of optical and chemical characteristics and their evolution during these periods. In both periods station KO (located furthest from the open sea) presented different physical, chemical and biological characteristics with respect to the other stations inside the Boka Kotorska Bay. A positive correlation was found between CDOM and chlorophyll alpha (R = 0.7, P < 0.001, n = 15) and this implies that in this area, similarly to the open sea, the primary source of CDOM should be the biological production from phytoplankton. This is probably due to the fact that the rivers entering the Boka Kotorska Bay are not severely impacted by man.

Mapping coloured dissolved organic matter concentration in coastal waters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Optical properties of the Baltic Sea are dominated by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). High concentration of CDOM is probably one of the reasons why standard chlorophyll-retrieval algorithms fail badly in the Baltic Sea. Our aim was to test can CDOM be mapped by remote sensing instruments in coastal waters of relatively CDOM-rich environments like the Baltic Sea. The results show that sensors with high radiometric resolution, such as Advanced Land Imager (ALI), can be used for mapping CDOM in a wide concentration range. The ALI image also showed that optical properties of coastal waters are extremely variable. CDOM concentration may vary 4-5-fold in two adjacent 30 m pixels. This indicates a need for relatively high spatial resolution (30 m or less) remote sensing data in monitoring coastal environments.

Much longer time was required for equilibration of a solution of mixed HSs with pyrene as a probe, than for a solution comprising a single HS. Restructuring processes were responsible for the difference in equilibration kinetics and included conformational changes and aggregation. A major factor found controlling these processes was intermolecular interactions between components of HSs, although the concentration and hydrophobicity of the HSs were also important. In addition, the fluorescence quenching method yielded the binding constant (KDOC) of the HSs with pyrene. The KDOC of pyrene with binary humic mixtures was found to follow the conservative mixing rule. The findings of this study are applicable to studies of other hydrophobic organic pollutants and HSs and, will assist in modeling of the transport and fate of pollutants in aquatic environments.																	1093-4529						2009	44	2					170	178	PII 907330872	10.1080/10934520802539814						WOS:000262149400007	19123097

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the characteristics of DOM influence the DBPs formation mechanism. A study was, therefore, initiated to investigate the effects of DOM fractions on DBPs formation mechanism. In the chlorination process, organic acids are dominant precursors of total thihalomethanes (TTHM) because of the nu(C-O) and unsaturated structures. Furthermore, the TTHM formation of organic acids was affected by pH more greatly. Based on the fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, DOM fractions contained several fluorescence substances. During chlorination, humic acid-like substances were found to exhibit high chlorine reactivity and hydrophobic organics decomposed to smaller molecules faster than hydrophilic organics even at lower chlorine dosages. Unlike hydrophobic fractions, hydrophilic organics showed no toxicity following chlorination, suggesting that the toxic structures in hydrophilic organics showed high chlorine reactivity during chlorination.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2009	21	1					54	61								WOS:000262568800011	19402400

Among the 6 fractions, FA was predominant and accounted for 51% of the total DOM. The weight-average (M-w) and number-averaged (M-n) molecular weight of these fractions ranged from 1688 to 2355 Da and from 1338 to 1928 Da, respectively. A strong correlation was observed between specific UV absorbance at 280 nm, E-2/E-3 (absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm), and the molecular weight for DOM fractions. UV-Vis fulvic-like fluorescence peaks were found in all fractions. Protein-re fluorescence peaks existed in HON may indicate that microbial activity was severely in Lake Hongfeng. There was a significant relationship between fluorescence intensities and specific UV absorbance at 254 nm for those DOM fractions, suggesting their similar luminescence characteristics. The values of fluorescence index (f(450/500)) indicated that hydrophobic fractions may derive from terrestrial sources, and the hydrophilic fractions from microbial and terrestrial origins. Those results suggest that there were inter-relationships between molecular weight, fluorescence and absorbance characteristics, and also subtle consistencies between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties and the sources for these 6 fractions from Lake Hongfeng.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2009	21	5					581	588		10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62311-6						WOS:000266020800004	20108658

An aminated polymeric adsorbent NDA-8 with tertiary amino groups and sufficient mesopore was synthesized, which exhibited high adsorption capacity to the DOM (raw water after coagulation). Resin NDA-8 performed better in the uptake of the DOM than resin DAX-8 and A100. Electrostatic attraction was considered as the decisive interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate. Special attention was paid to the correlation between porous structure and adsorption capacity. The mesopore of NDA-8 played a crucial role during uptake of the DOM. In general, resin in chloride form performed a higher removal rate of DOC. According to the column adsorption test, total adsorption capacity of NDA-8 was calculated to 52.28 mg DOC/mL wet resin. 0.2 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution could regenerate the adsorbent efficiently.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2009	21	8					1089	1095		10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62386-4						WOS:000269139100010	19862922

Increases in the longwave photobleaching of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in coastal waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Salinity effects on the photobleaching of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) due to coastal mixing were investigated through a comparative study of surrogate and surface-water CDOM. Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and ultrafiltered river dissolved organic matter (UDOM) added to mixtures of river and seawater permeates (<1 kDa) that varied in salinity from 0 to 33 to mimic coastal mixing. Surface-water CDOM was collected from the Chesapeake Bay in January, June, and September 2002. Shortwave CDOM absorption loss (e.g., 280 nm) did not change with salinity; however, longwave CDOM absorption loss (e.g., 440 nm) often decreased by 10% to 40% with salinity. Apparent quantum yields for average absorption loss from 280 to 550 nm (phi(avg)) increased with salinity for both surrogate and surface-water CDOM, providing evidence for an effect of salinity independent of light absorption among different samples. Further, hydrogen peroxide photoproduction from UDOM increased from 15 to 368 nmol L(-1) h(-1) with salinity, even though pH values were circumneutral. A kinetic model demonstrated that, at circumneutral pH and iron concentrations expected for the Chesapeake Bay, photo-Fenton chemistry could not explain the increase in hydrogen peroxide production quantum yields (phi(hp)) with salinity. Using phi(avg) for the SRHA and UDOM surrogates, a model of the change in surface-water CDOM photoreactivity in the Chesapeake Bay as a function of salinity suggested additional CDOM inputs for the lower Chesapeake Bay. Because estuarine mixing increases photobleaching of longwave CDOM absorption, the modeling of absorption coefficients above 400 nm may underestimate dissolved organic matter in coastal waters.

Here we describe a method useful for quantifying fluxes and analyzing dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics. The method uses coupled optical and acoustic measurements that provide robust quantitative estimates of concentrations and constituent characteristics needed to investigate processes and calculate fluxes of DOM in tidal and other lotic environments. Data were collected several times per hour for 2 weeks or more, with the frequency and duration limited only by power consumption and data storage capacity. We assessed the capabilities and limitations of the method using data from a winter deployment in a natural tidal wetland of the San Francisco Bay estuary. We used statistical correlation of in situ optical data with traditional laboratory analyses of discrete water samples to calibrate optical properties suited as proxies for DOM concentrations and characterizations. Coupled with measurements of flow velocity, we calculated long-term residual horizontal fluxes of DOC into and out from a tidal wetland. Subsampling the dataset provides an estimate for the maximum sampling interval beyond which the error in flux estimate is significantly increased.

Dissolved organic matter release in a Posidonia oceanica meadow	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We examined annual nutrient changes (nitrate, phosphate and ammonium) and the net dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) release using in situ benthic incubations in a Posidonia oceanica meadow and in unvegetated sediments of Magalluf Bay (Mallorca Island, Spain) at monthly intervals. We also examined the role of the P. oceanica meadow in the C:N:P ratio transformations by comparing the ratios between the inorganic and dissolved organic fluxes in the seagrass ecosystem and those in the plant material. Our results indicate that P. oceanica communities enhance DOC fluxes relative to adjacent unvegetated sediments. The net DOC release from the P. oceanica meadow represents 71 % of the net community production. The C:N:P ratio in the flux of dissolved organic material (DOM) from the P. oceanica community (1450:69:1) exceeded the C:N:P ratio in the DOM flux of unvegetated sediment communities. The high flux of DOC release from this seagrass community might be enriched in carbon compounds, as these plants produce nonstructural carbohydrates in excess.

J	Wilson, HF; Xenopoulos, MA				Wilson, Henry F.; Xenopoulos, Marguerite A.			Effects of agricultural land use on the composition of fluvial dissolved organic matter	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Nearly 40% of the Earth's ice-free surface area is cropland or pasture(1). Agricultural land use can increase the delivery of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to fluvial ecosystems(2), but the impact of farming on riverine dissolved organic carbon is still largely unknown, despite increasing recognition that rivers act as important modifiers in the global carbon cycle(3,4). Here, we examine the character of riverine dissolved organic matter in 34 watersheds along a gradient of agricultural land use. We show that changes in the character of dissolved organic matter are related to agricultural land use, nitrogen loading and wetland loss. Specifically, we find that the structural complexity of dissolved organic matter decreases as the ratio of continuous croplands to wetlands increases. At the same time, the amount of microbially derived dissolved organic matter increases with greater agricultural land use. Furthermore, we find that periods of soil dryness are associated with a decrease in the structural complexity of dissolved organic matter. We suggest that these effects of land use and climate on the character of riverine dissolved organic matter have important implications for global carbon cycling, owing to their potential to control rates of microbial carbon processing ( for example, uptake, retention and outgassing) in agricultural systems.																	1752-0894					JAN	2009	2	1					37	41		10.1038/NGEO391						WOS:000262638500018

Direct Fourier transform mass spectral analysis of natural waters with low dissolved organic matter	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												A major obstacle for characterizing dissolved organic matter (DOM) with ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry has been its low concentrations in natural waters. Many previous mass spectrometric studies of both terrestrial and marine DOM typically have isolated and concentrated the DOM using solid phase C(18) extraction disks, ultrafiltration, or XAD resins, all of which are known to discriminate against many different classes of compounds. We have, for the first time, developed an approach to directly analyze natural water samples with less than 6 mg/l DOC (dissolved organic carbon), using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS). We demonstrate the sensitivity and ability of sequential selective ion accumulation (SSIA) to detect the thousands of components in a single freshwater DOM sample without any significant pretreatment. By utilizing SSIA, the baseline noise decreases while signal to noise ratios of the peaks increase, allowing for approximately 40% more formulas to be assigned to peaks in the mass spectra.

On two occasions during the austral summer, bacteria-free water of the lagoon was exposed to different regions of the solar spectrum (full solar radiation, UV-A + PAR, PAR) or kept in the dark. Subsequently, dilution cultures were established with bacterioplankton from the lagoon that were incubated in the pre-exposed water for 5 h in the dark. Cell abundance, activity, and community composition of bacterioplankton were assessed before and after incubation in the different treatments. Changes in absorption, fluorescence, and DOC concentration were used as proxies for CDOM photoalteration. We found a significant CDOM photobleaching signal, DOC loss, as well as a stimulation of bacterial activity in the treatments pre-exposed to UV radiation, suggesting increased bioavailability of DOM. Bacterial community analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that this stimulation was mainly accompanied by the specific enrichment of Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria. Thus, our results suggest that CDOM photoalteration not only stimulates bacterioplankton growth, but also induces rapid changes in bacterioplankton composition, which can be of relevance for ecosystem functioning, particularly considering present and future changes in the input of terrestrial CDOM to aquatic systems.

Based on the measured absorption of CDOM data, it was found that the band combination of R667/R410 has the ability to retrieve the CDOM. A local algorithm for estimation of CDOM was developed. The application of the algorithm shows that the estimated CDOM absorption is in close agreement with that measured values. The relative error of the estimated CDOM absorption is generally less 30%. The distributions of CDOM indicating the river water is a main source of CDOM in this estuary.																			978-1-4244-4130-3				2009							2988	2990								WOS:000280804301284

THMs and HAAs are the most common and have diverse toxicological effects. The formations of THMs and HAAs by chlorination with chlorine and chloramine at several DOM concentrations and pH's were investigated. Water sample was obtained from Istanbul Omerli Dam, isolated using a laboratory scale membrane system used for chlorination study at different organic matter concentrations. Diluted isolate samples were chlorinated according to UFC protocol. 24 hours after chlorination THM formation was in lower level at acidic pH, whereas at neutral or basic pH, higher concentrations of THMs formed. For all DOC conditions ultimate DBP levels were reached at 24 hours. Chloraminated samples slightly acidic (6) and slightly basic (8) pH resulted in lower THM from neutral pH. HAA formation in pH 6 and 7.2 were equal while lower at pH 8. Despite strong fluctuations ultimate levels were reached in the first 8 hours after chloramination. All formed DBPs except BF were considerably higher in chlorination. Effect of pH in the range of 6 to 8 was approximately the same in both disinfectants. Chloramination completes DBP formation reactions earlier and results in much lower quantities in terms of total THMs and HAAs.																			978-960-474-057-4				2009							180	185								WOS:000265334600029

Sewage sludge samples were collected at different municipal wastewater treatment plants in Spain. Monitoring the evolution of the organic matter in the sludge by NMR can be a very useful tool in order to avoid environmental pollution problems. NMR can show molecular information about the composition of the SOM and, in this way, different chemometric tools can offer the possibility of finding markers for the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge. With an appropriate use of algorithms is possible to resolve the molecular complexity of SOM.				paredes, concepcion/C-9325-2012; Bustamante, Maria Angeles/H-9171-2013; Moral, Raul/C-7473-2009; Jorda, Juana Dolores/F-6354-2016	Bustamante, Maria Angeles/0000-0001-9931-1711; Moral, Raul/0000-0002-4881-480X; 														978-7-03-024459-8				2009							1204	1208								WOS:000271258000210

Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter Cycling during a Ross Sea Phaeocystis antarctica Bloom	SMITHSONIAN AT THE POLES: CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL POLAR YEAR SCIENCE					Smithsonian Poles Symposium 2007	MAY 03-04, 2007	Smithsonian Inst, Washington, DC		Smithsonian Inst			Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is ubiquitous in the oceans, where it is an important elemental reservoir, a key photoreactant, and a sunscreen for ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter is generally the main attenuator of UV radiation in the water column, and it affects the remote sensing of chlorophyll a (chl a) such that corrections for CDOM need to be incorporated into remote sensing algorithms. Despite its significance, relatively few CDOM measurements have been made in the open ocean, especially in polar regions. In this paper, we show that CDOM spectral absorption coefficients (a(lambda)) are relatively low in highly productive Antarctic waters, ranging from approximately 0.18 to 0.30 m(-1) at 300 run and 0.014 to 0.054 m(-1) at 443 nm. These values are low compared to coastal waters, but they are higher (by approximately a factor of two to three) than a(lambda) in oligotrophic waters at low latitudes, supporting the supposition of a poleward increase in a(CDOM) in the open ocean. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter a(lambda) and spectral slopes did not increase during the early development of a bloom of the colonial haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, even though chl a concentrations increased more than one-hundred-fold. Our results suggest that Antarctic CDOM in the Ross Sea is not coupled directly to algal production of organic matter in the photic zone during the early bloom but is rather produced in the photic zone at a later time or elsewhere in the water column, possibly from organic-rich sea ice or the microbial degradation of algal-derived dissolved organic matter exported out of the photic zone. Spectral a(lambda) at 32S nm for surface waters in the Southern Ocean and Ross Sea were remarkably similar to values reported for deep water from the North Atlantic by Nelson et al. in 2007. This similarity may not be a coincidence and may indicate long-range transport to the North Atlantic of CDOM produced in the Antarctic via Antarctic Intermediate and Bottom Water.																			978-0-9788460-1-5				2009							319	333		10.5479/si.097884601X.24						WOS:000264705700024

J	Zhang, CX; Wang, YX				Zhang, Caixiang; Wang, Yanxin			Removal of dissolved organic matter and phthalic acid esters from landfill leachate through a complexation-flocculation process	WASTE MANAGEMENT												Dissolved organic macromolecules (DOM) and micropollutants, such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs), are often enriched in landfill leachate. PAEs were detected in 10 leachate samples from three landfills in Hubei province, central China. In particular, di-(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) concentration was higher than 70 mu g L(-1) in most samples, and the highest DEHP concentration was in the colloid fraction (1000 Da-0.45 mu m). Use of flocculants may result in flocculation and precipitation of colloids and associated contaminants, such as DEHP. Biodegradation is not effective for long chain PAEs or the landfill leachate, given the low ratio of BOD(5)/COD (less than 0.2) and deficient phosphorus content. Complexation-flocculation is therefore proposed as an alternative process for removing DOM and PAEs. jar-test experiments were employed to investigate the mechanism and feasibility of the process. Among tested coagulants (ferric chloride, aluminum sulfate and poly aluminum chloride (PAC)), PAC was the most efficient. Hydrophobic contaminants with log K(OC) greater than 4 and DOM in wastewater can be removed simultaneously through the complexation-flocculation process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen enriched dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolates and their affinity to form emerging disinfection by-products	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Increased contributions from wastewater discharges and algal activity in drinking water supplies can lead to elevated levels of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), which can increase the likelihood for the formation of emerging nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) of health concern. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from five waters, using a newly developed DOM isolation method specific to DON fractionation, produced thirty-four isolates of suitable mass. Each isolate was treated with free chlorine or chloramines under formation potential conditions. The DBP yields were determined for three halogenated DBPs (trichloromethane, dichloroacetonitrile, and trichloronitromethane) and one non-halogenated DBP (N-nitrosodimethylamine [NDMA]). Halogenated DBP yields were greater during the application of free chlorine, however chloramination produced significant levels of halogenated N-DBPs for some isolates. NDMA was only observed to form from selected nitrogen-enriched isolates (DOC/DON ratio, 20 mg/mg), especially those isolated from treated wastewater. Other results indicated that nitrogen-enriched DOM resulted in increased yields of the other N-DBPs studied.

Acquiring reproducible fluorescence spectra of dissolved organic matter at very low concentrations	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A method that would allow for fast and reliable measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM), both at low and high concentration levels would be a valuable tool for online monitoring of DOM. This could have applications in a variety of areas including membrane treatment systems for drinking water applications which is of interest to our group. In this study, the feasibility of using fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring DOM at very low concentration levels was demonstrated with an emphasis on optimizing the instrument parameters necessary to obtain reproducible fluorescence signals. Signals were acquired using a cuvette or a fibre optic probe assembly, the latter which may have applications for on-line or in-line monitoring. The instrument parameters such as photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage, scanning rate and slit width were studied in detail to find the optimum parameter settings required. The results showed that larger excitation and emission slit widths were preferred, over larger PMT voltage or lower scanning rates, to obtain reproducible and rapid measurements when measuring very low concentration levels of DOM. However, this approach should be implemented with caution to avoid any reduction of the signal resolution.

However, the mechanism by which the dissolved organic matters (DOMs) affect soil properties or interact with other substances in soils is largely unknown. In this study, a batch equilibrium experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of two types of DOMs on the behavior of prometryne (a herbicide) in soils. Two sorts of DOMs were derived from lakebed sludge (SL) and rice straw (ST), respectively. The results show that sorption capacity in one soil for prometryne was significantly reduced by application of DOMs, whereas desorption of prometryne was promoted by DOM treatments. To understand the mobility behavior of prometryne in soils with DOMs, a column leaching experiment was carried out. It is shown that both DOMs enhanced the solubility and migration of prometryne in soils. To confirm the role of DOMs in regulating the mobility of prometryne in soils, a soil thin-layer chromatography was performed. The migration of prometryne was promoted by DOMs, which were used as a developing solvent or directly incorporated in the soil thin layer. The data indicate that DOM extracts can modify the mobility of prometryne in soil.																	0021-8561					DEC 24	2008	56	24					11933	11940		10.1021/jf8023134						WOS:000261802400053	19053378

Therefore, determining the factors shaping spatial and temporal patterns is particularly essential in the most susceptible, low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lakes. We analyzed spatiotemporal variations in dissolved organic carbon concentration and dissolved organic matter optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) in 11 transparent lakes located above tree line in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain), and we assessed potential external (evaporation and atmospheric deposition) and internal (bacterial abundance, bacterial production, chlorophyll a, and catchment vegetation) drivers of DOM patterns. At spatial and temporal scales, bacteria were related to chromophoric DOM (CDOM). At the temporal scale, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in dust deposition and evaporation were found to have a significant influence on DOC and CDOM in two Sierra Nevada lakes studied during the ice-free periods of 2000-2002. DOC concentrations and absorption coefficients at 320 nm were strongly correlated over the spatial scale (n = 11, R(2) = 0.86; p < 0.01), but inconsistently correlated over time, indicating seasonal and interannual variability in external factors and a differential response of DOC concentration and CDOM to these factors. At the continental scale, higher mean DOC concentrations and more CDOM in lakes of the Sierra Nevada than in lakes of the Pyrenees and Alps may be due to a combination of more extreme evaporation, and greater atmospheric dust deposition.

The production rate, Q(co), decreased seaward horizontally and downward vertically. Q(co) exhibited a positive, linear correlation with the abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Terrestrial DOM was more efficient at producing CO than marine DOM. The temperature dependence of Q(co) can be characterized by the Arrhenius equation with the activation energies of freshwater samples being higher than those of salty samples. Q(co) remained relatively constant between pH 4-6, increased slowly between pH 6-8 and then rapidly with further rising pH. Ionic strength and iron chemistry had little influence on Q(co). An empirical equation, describing Q(co) as a function of CDOM abundance, temperature, pH, and salinity, was established to evaluate CO dark production in the global coastal waters (depth < 200 m). The total coastal CO dark production from DOM was estimated to be from 0.46 to 1.50 Tg CO-C a(-1) (Tg carbon from CO a(-1)). We speculated the global oceanic (coastal plus open ocean) CO dark production to be in the range from 4.87 to 15.8 Tg CO-C a(-1) by extrapolating the coastal water-based results to blue waters (depth > 200 m). Both the coastal and global dark source strengths are significant compared to the corresponding photochemical CO source strengths (coastal: similar to 2.9 Tg CO-C a(-1); global: similar to 50 Tg CO-C a(-1)). Steady state deepwater CO concentrations inferred from Q(co) and microbial CO uptake rates are < 0.1 nmol L-1.

J	Traversa, A; D'Orazio, V; Senesi, N				Traversa, Andreina; D'Orazio, Valeria; Senesi, Nicola			Properties of dissolved organic matter in forest soils: Influence of different plant covering	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The nature of different forest plant litters and the effect of their degradation processes on the properties of soil dissolved organic matter is a very important environmental issue in protected areas such as the "Natural Oriented Reserve Bosco delle Pianelle" in Southern Italy, Chemical and spectroscopic techniques were used to evaluate the influence of four different tree covers on the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from litter and surface soil layers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that all litter samples feature a prevalent aromatic character. Ligninolitic components of litters produced by Pinus halepensis L. and a mixture of Quercus trojana Webb. and Q ilex L. were more degraded than those produced by either Q ilex or a mixture of Carpinus betulus L. and C. orientalis Miller. The larger C/N ratios of the former litters might account for the greater degradation. Further, a lesser lignin decomposition was shown also for the latter samples, likely due to adverse topographical factors, such as less intense sunlight and greater moisture content. Spectroscopic analysis of litter DOM showed that easily degraded components, such as water-soluble compounds and carbohydrates, were preferentially degraded resulting in DOM that was enriched in lignin-derived compounds. Fluorescence analysis data of all litter DOM samples showed the occurrence of fluorescent units qualitatively similar regardless of plant covering, which suggests that in all cases simple structural components of low-molecular weight and small degree of aromatic polycondensation and content of conjugated chromophores are present. Soil DOM featured several numerous fluorescent units that differ as a function of the parent litter and/or its decomposition processes. Along the soil profiles water-soluble aliphatic compounds of low-molecular weight are found down to the deepest layer, whereas aromatic-ligninolitic compounds are decreasing with depth, probably because of their adsorption by mineral soil components. A greater amount of aromatic units, likely lignin-derived compounds, was found in the DOM from P. halepensis L., which suggested a more extended lignin decomposition. Further, with increasing soil depth, DOM was characterized by a decrease of low-molecular weight organic molecules and lower degree of humification. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We traced sources of water, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) using stream water samples collected at high frequency during spring snowmelt. Hydrochemistry, isotopic tracers, and end-member mixing analyses suggested the timing, sources, and source areas from which water and nutrients entered the stream. Although stream-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) both originated from leaching of soluble organic matter, flushing responses between these two DOM components varied because of dynamic shifts of hydrological flow paths and sources that supply the highest concentrations of DOC and DON. High concentrations of stream water nitrate originated from atmospheric sources as well as nitrified sources from catchment soils. We detected nitrification in surficial soils during late snowmelt which affected the nitrate supply that was available to be transported to streams. However, isotopic tracers showed that the majority of nitrate in upslope surficial soil waters after the onset of snowmelt originated from atmospheric sources. A fraction of the atmospheric nitrogen was directly delivered to the stream, and this finding highlights the importance of quick flow pathways during snowmelt events. These findings indicate that interactions among sources, transformations, and hydrologic transport processes must be deciphered to understand why concentrations vary over time and over space as well as to elucidate the direct effects of human activities on nutrient dynamics in upland forest streams.

Tracing groundwater flow and sources of organic carbon in sandstone aquifers using fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The fluorescence properties of groundwaters from sites in two UK aquifers, the Penrith Sandstone of Cumbria and the Sherwood Sandstone of South Yorkshire, were investigated using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Both aquifers are regionally important sources of public supply water and are locally impacted by pollution. The Penrith Sandstone site is in a rural setting while the Sherwood Sandstone site is in suburban Doncaster. Fluorescence analysis of samples from discrete sample depths in the Penrith Sandstone shows decreasing fulvic-like intensities with depth and also shows a good correlation with CFC-12, an anthropogenic groundwater tracer. Tryptophan-like fluorescence centres; in the depth profile may also provide evidence of rapid routing of relatively recent applications of organic slurry along fractures. Fluorescence analysis of groundwater sampled from multi-level piezometers installed within the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer also shows regions of tryptophan-like and relatively higher fulvic-like signatures. The fluorescence intensity profile in the piezometers shows tryptophan-like peaks at depths in excess of 50 m and mirrors the pattern exhibited by microbial species and CFCs highlighting the deep and rapid penetration of modern recharge due to rapid fracture flow. Fluorescence analysis has allowed the rapid assessment of different types and relative abundances of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and the fingerprinting of different sources of organic C within the groundwater system. The tryptophan:fulvic ratios found in the Penrith Sandstone were found to be between 0.5 and 3.0 and are characteristic of ratios from sheep waste sources. The Sherwood Sandstone has the lowest ratios (0.2-0.4) indicating a different source of DOM, most likely a mixture of terrestrial and microbial sources, although there is little evidence of pollution from leaking urban sewage systems. Results from these two studies suggest that intrinsic fluorescence may be used as a proxy for, or complementary tool to, other groundwater investigation methods in helping provide a conceptual model of groundwater flow and identifying different sources of DOM within the groundwater system.

Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) distribution dynamics in this LSL were analyzed using Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) fluorescence and UV/Vis absorption measurements. The levels of CDOM in surface water in Doubtful Sound were much higher than previously reported for coastal zones. CDOM analyzed by UV/Vis absorbance and EEM fluorescence decreased by about 90% within the first 5 m depth. In the first 5 m, the salinity gradient was extreme (5 - 34 salinity), creating a vertical mixing gradient, which appeared to be stable over time. The spectral slope S and the fluorescence index increased during vertical mixing within the first 5 m depth indicating changes in the CDOM chromophores. Observations during a strong rain event revealed that CDOM in a freshwater stream initially increased, but decreased with additional rain (same flow rate), which is an indication that most CDOM was quickly exported within these catchments. Furthermore, the lower CDOM input after substantial rain diluted the surface CDOM level and created a subsurface CDOM maximum. However, shortly after the rain event (< 24 h) the surface CDOM maximum with a steady decrease with depth was restored. The combination of extreme rainfall, pristine temperate rain forest and steep mountains with distinct watersheds creates a highly dynamic environment with very high terrestrial CDOM input. These CDOM dynamics and the high degree of scatter in the linear correlations between CDOM levels and salinity cannot be explained solely in terms of conservative mixing, but suggest that biophysical controls in the catchments and mixing with marine derived CDOM are involved in the dynamics of CDOM in this system.

Relating dissolved organic matter fluorescence and functional properties	CHEMOSPHERE												The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix properties of 25 dissolved organic matter samples from three rivers and one lake are analysed. All sites are sampled in duplicate, and the 25 samples include ten taken from the lake site, and nine from one of the rivers, to cover variations in dissolved organic matter composition due to season and river flow. Fluorescence properties are compared to the functional properties of the dissolved organic matter; the functional assays provide quantitative information on photochemical fading, buffering capacity, copper binding, benzo[a]pyrene binding, hydrophilicity and adsorption to alumina. Optical (absorbance and fluorescence) characterization of the dissolved organic matter samples demonstrates that (1) peak C (excitation 300-350 nm; emission 400-460 nm) fluorescence emission wavelength; (2) the ratio of peak T (excitation 220-235 nm; emission 330-370 nm) to peak C fluorescence intensity; and (3) the peak C fluorescence intensity: absorbance at 340 nm ratio have strong correlations with many of the functional assays. Strongest correlations are with benzo[a]pyrene binding. alumina adsorption, hydrophilicity and buffering capacity, and in many cases linear regression equations with a correlation coefficient >0.8 are obtained. These optical properties are independent of freshwater dissolved organic carbon concentration (for concentrations < 10 mg L(-1)) and therefore hold the potential for laboratory. field and on-line monitoring and prediction of organic matter functional properties.

Phenanthrene binding with polymerin was investigated. Moreover, the effect of addition of micro and nanoscale aluminum oxides (Al(2)O(3)) was studied, as well as sorption of polymerin on the oxides. Phenanthrene binding capacity by polymerin was notably higher than the sorption capacities for both types of Al(2)O(3) particles. Polymerin sorption on nanoparticles was nearly 100 times higher than microparticles. In a three-phase system, using microparticles, higher phenanthrene sorption was found by adding into water polymerin, oxides and phenanthrene simultaneously. In contrast, using nanoparticles, a considerable enhancement of phenanthrene sorption was shown by adding phenanthrene to a pre-formed and dried polymerin-oxide complex. These findings support the application of polymerin, especially associated with Al(2)O(3) nanoparticles, in remediation of water contaminated with HOCs. This work highlights the significant role of nanoparticles. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The UV-absorbance of dissolved organic matter predicts the fivefold variation in its affinity for mobilizing Cu in an agricultural soil horizon	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												It is well established that dissolved organic matter (DOM) mobilizes copper (Cu) in soils but it is unknown to what extent variable DOM quality affects this. During a 5 month period, 250 leachates of an uncontaminated agricultural soil were sampled at 45 cm depth using passive capillary wick samplers. The dissolved Cu and organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied sevenfold and were weakly correlated (r = 0.56). The [Cu] : [DOC] ratio varied fivefold and exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.77) with the specific UV-absorbance of DOM at 254 nm (SUVA), indicating that the more aromatic DOM had higher Cu affinity. The dissolved Cu concentrations were predicted by an assemblage model in WHAM6 using the composition of the solid phase above the wick samplers and that of the solution, including DOC. The predicted [Cu] : [DOC] ratio was almost constant when assuming default DOM properties with 65% of all DOM active as fulvic acid (%AFA). The %AFA was subsequently varied proportionally to the SUVA of DOM and using the SUVA of pure FA (SUVA(FA)) as a fitting parameter. In that case, the variation in the predicted [Cu] : [DOC] ratio was much larger and the predicted Cu concentrations were within a factor of 1.4 of the measured values for 90% of the samples. The fitted SUVA(FA) was 38 l g(-1) cm(-1), in excellent agreement with that of Suwannee River FA (SUVA(FA) = 37 l g(-1) cm(-1)). It is concluded that the DOM quality, e.g. the aromaticity, should be taken into account when estimating Cu mobility in soils.

Stabilization of dissolved organic matter by aluminium: a toxic effect or stabilization through precipitation?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Carbon mineralization in acidic forest soils can be retarded by large concentrations of aluminium (Al). However, it is still unclear whether Al reduces C mineralization by direct toxicity to microorganisms or by decreased bioavailability of organic matter (OM) because dissolved organic matter (DOM) is precipitated by Al. We conducted an incubation experiment (6 weeks) with two DOM solutions (40 mg C litre(-1)) derived from two acidic forests and possessing large differences in composition. Aluminium was added to the solutions in realistic ranges for acidic soils (1.6-24 mg Al litre(-1)) at pHs of 3.8 and 4.5, to achieve differences in Al speciation. We determined different Al species, including the potentially toxic Al(3+), by Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) to evaluate toxic effects on microorganisms. Precipitation of OM increased with larger amounts of added Al and higher pH, and we measured a larger fraction of dissolved 'free' Al at pH 3.8 than at pH 4.5. Organic matter degradation decreased significantly with Al addition, and we found more organic matter degraded at pH 3.8 than at pH 4.5 for the respective Al additions. Consequently, the observed reduction in OM degradation (i.e. stabilization) cannot be explained by toxic effects of 'free' Al. However, C stabilization correlated significantly with C precipitation. The pH did not influence C stabilization directly, but determined the amount of C being precipitated. Phosphorus was removed along with OM by precipitation, which possibly also affected C stabilization. We conclude that C stabilization upon Al addition did not result from toxic effects, but was caused by reduced bioavailability of OM after its precipitation. The reduction in OM degradation by 65% is of great relevance for the overall C stabilization in acidic forest soils. Increasing pH and decreasing Al concentrations upon recovery from acidic deposition should therefore not result in decreased stabilization of precipitated OM.

Several studies have investigated the effects of known organic compounds on phytoplankton growth, however, the role of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) in phytoplankton nutrition remains understudied at the compound level. This lack of research is due in part to analytical limitations for the characterization of DOM compounds. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) provides an unprecedented level of chemical information on thousands of organic compounds that comprise the bulk DOM pool. In this paper we provide a brief overview of some of the benefits and caveats of using ESI to investigate DOM in natural freshwater and marine systems and show an example of ESI-MS DOM characterization for a natural bloom of the raphidophyte Chattonella cf. verruculosa.

It was found that organic acids dominated in reclaimed water and the ratios Of UV(254) (absorbance at 254 nm) to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (SUVA(254)) ratio exhibited a common relationship: HoA > reclaimed water > HiA. The influences of chemical structures and experimental conditions on the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) were investigated, respectively. SUVA254 was found to exhibit a positive and statistically significant correlation with DBPs formation potential. The specific trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation potential decreased as the same sequence: acids, neutrals and bases. The formation of DBPs depended more on a combination of aromatic moieties and aliphatic structures such as hydroxy acids. Furthermore, THMs formed more easily at alkaline conditions; however, hydrophobic organics formed HAAs more easily at acidic conditions. whereas hydrophilic organics achieved relatively high HAAs at both acidic and strong alkaline conditions. Moreover, the observed rate constant for HAAs formation was larger than the rate constant for THMs formation. Addition of ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)-N) changed chlorine to chloramines with lower oxidation potential, and correspondingly influenced the formation of DBPs especially at the chlorination breakpoint.

Responses to N and P fertilization in a young Eucalyptus dunnii plantation: Microbial properties, enzyme activities and dissolved organic matter	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												The short-term effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application on soil microbial properties, dissolved organic matter and enzyme activity were examined in a young Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden plantation at Huitong county, southern China. The objectives of the study were to understand how N and P addition impacts microbial activity and dissolved organic matter in subtropical plantation forest ecosystems. Treatments in this study included 100 kg N ha(-1) (N1), 200 kg N ha(-1) (N2),75 kg P ha(-1) (P1), 150 kg P ha(-1) (P2) and the control without any fertilizer application (CK). N application significantly increased soil microbial biomass N, mineralized N, dissolved organic N, and invertase, urease and acid phosphatase activities, but decreased microbial biomass carbon (C) and P, basal respiration, metabolic quotient and dissolved organic P in comparison with the control. P application decreased microbial biomass N, mineralized N, urease and acid phosphatase activities, whereas it increased dissolved organic P, microbial biomass P and metabolic quotient. We conclude that the influences of N and P addition on microbial activity, soil enzyme activities and dissolved organic matter were different in the studied E. dunnii plantation.

Linking allochthonous dissolved organic matter and boreal lake sediment carbon sequestration: The role of light-mediated flocculation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured flocculation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water from a humic lake (DOC = 14.9 mg C L(-1)) and from an adjacent mire (DOC = 25.7 mg C L(-1)), in in situ enclosure experiments with different light regimes. Light stimulated the formation of organic particles in both waters, and organic particle formation was observed at all incubation depths, even in the dark controls. Production of phytoplankton biomass was negligible, and allochthonous DOC was the most important precursor of the sinking particles. 8-22% and 25-60% of the loss of DOC in lake and mire water, respectively, could be accounted for by flocculation. Depth-integrated flocculation based on the enclosure experiments was 14.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Lake-water DOC concentration and water color has been increasing during the last decade, and sediment trap studies show that gross sedimentation of organic carbon also increased. Thus flocculation of allochthonous DOC, stimulated by light, constitutes a pathway for the sequestration of carbon in lake sediments.

J	Minor, E; Stephens, B				Minor, Elizabeth; Stephens, Brandon			Dissolved organic matter characteristics within the Lake Superior watershed	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Within the aquatic carbon cycle, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays key roles: as a link between terrestrial and aquatic systems, a major food source for biota, a player in photochemical reactions and a sunscreen/competitor for light for aquatic organisms. The molecular-level composition of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) is believed to determine the efficacy of DOM in these roles. While much detailed compositional information is available on selected DOM isolates from both freshwater and marine systems, relatively few studies have presented molecular information for multiple sites within the same system and few of these have focused upon large lakes. Therefore, we present an initial study of surface water DOM characteristics in a temperate large lake (Lake Superior, USA) and selected tributaries. UV-visible spectroscopy, electrospray mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses of bulk DOM, along with FTIR and direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry analyses of C-18 extracts, illustrate a shift from higher molecular weight organic matter enriched in protein and lignin at the tributary sites toward compositionally different material in the open lake. Differences in optical characteristics and DOC concentration between tributary and open lake sites are consistent with possible photodegradation of tributary DOM. Comparison of our FTIR data with those from a previous Chesapeake Bay study indicates that DOM in both the freshwater tributaries and the open lake contain a wider range of aromatic and carbohydrate components than that in the saltwater tributary and bay. This highlights the need for further cross system comparisons of natural organic matter composition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a modified Leenheer fractionation scheme, dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from landfill leachate of three different ages was fractioned according to their polarities and charge characteristics by using XAD-8 resin, and the fractions of hydrophobic acid AOA), neutral (HON) and hydrophilic matter (HIM) were obtained, Then the fluorescence and UV spectra of DOM fractions were determined. The fluorescence synchronous scan spectra of DOM fractions exhibited a primary peak at 280 rim for 0-year-old, while the primary peak exhibited at 340nm for 5 and 10 year-old, suggesting that DOM fractions contained mainly protein-like matter at initial stage of landfill, and with the increase in landfill ages, aromatic structures of DOM fractions in leachate were enriched. Among the DOM fractions of HOA, HON and HIM at different ages of landfill leachate, the fluorescence and UV spectra all indicated that the molecular weight, content of aromatic compounds and degree of condensation were all in the order of HOA>HON>HIM. The ratio of U`V absorbance at 253 run to that at 203 nm.

The fluorescence synchronous scan spectra of DOM in 0-year-old leachate exhibited a primary peak at 335 ran, a secondary peak at 455 nm, and a shoulder peak at 385 nm. While the fluorescence intensities of DOM at different peaks were decreased for 5-year-old leachate especially those of the peaks at shorter wavelengths (335 and 385 nm) which may be ascribed that the simpler structural components were decreased sharply. Compared with 5-year-old leachate, the fluorescence intensity of DOM in 10-year-old leachate decreased slightly. Three-dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra (3DEEM) of DOM in 0-year-old leachate exhibited two peaks at Ex/Em wavelength pairs of 270/355 and 220/350, respectively, which were all associated with protein-derived compounds, while the peaks of protein-like disappeared in 5-year-old leachate, and new peaks of complex structural fulvic acid-like were formed at Ex/Em wavelength pair of 330/412. 5 and 250/416.5, respectively. This indicated the component of DOM in the leachate of 5-year-old landfill led to a decrease in low molecular compound, and an increase in high molecular compound compared to that of the 0-year-old. 3DEEM of DOM of 10-year-old leachate was similar to that of DOM in the 5-year-old, but the fluorescence intensity of the peaks of fulvic acid-like in DOM was different, and compared with that of 5-year-old leachate, the peak of DOM in 10-year-old leachate shifted from Ex/Em wavelength pair of 250/416. 5 to 250/427.5. This indicated that the DOM formed similar structures, but the structure of fulvic acid-like in DOM of 10-year-old leachate had a greater degree of aromatization and quantity than that of 5-year-old leachate. The results obtained from fluorescence synchronous scan spectroscopy and 3DEEM indicate that aromatic structures of DOM are enriched with the age of landfill leachate.																	1000-0593					NOV	2008	28	11					2605	2608		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2008)11-2605-04						WOS:000261459900034		
J	De La Rocha, CL; Nowald, N; Passow, U				De La Rocha, Christina L.; Nowald, Nicolas; Passow, Uta			Interactions between diatom aggregates, minerals, particulate organic carbon, and dissolved organic matter: Further implications for the ballast hypothesis	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Correlations of particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral fluxes into sediment traps in the deep sea have previously suggested that interactions between organic matter and minerals play a key role in organic matter flux to the deep. Here experiments were carried out in rolling tanks to observe the incorporation of suspended biogenic minerals ( calcium carbonate coccoliths or silica diatom frustules) into diatom aggregates and examine their influence on aggregate character. Addition of higher concentrations of suspended minerals to tanks resulted in a decrease in aggregate volume and mass and in an increase in aggregate number. POC to dry weight ratios also declined as mineral concentrations increased, saturating at 2-5 weight percent POC. Large amounts of suspended particulate material, consisting of miniscule aggregates of both inorganic material and organic matter, formed during the experiments. This suggested sizable scavenging of dissolved organic matter into the particulate phase during the experiment in general, and in particular associated with the presence of suspended minerals. Some of the increase in particulate inorganic matter may have been tied to cation crosslinking of the polymerized organic matter. The C to N ratio of this scavenged material was lower in the opal experiments than in the calcium carbonate experiments, suggesting differences in the compounds being formed.																	0886-6236					OCT 18	2008	22	4							GB4005	10.1029/2007GB003156						WOS:000260177700001

Combining reverse osmosis and pulsed electrical current electrodialysis for improved recovery of dissolved organic matter from seawater	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the oceans is one of the largest dynamic reservoirs of carbon on earth. comparable in size to the atmospheric reservoir of carbon (as CO2) in the atmosphere, or to the amount of carbon in all terrestrial and aquatic biota. The concerted efforts of earth scientists, atmospheric scientists, and biologists who study global biogeochemical cycles and the earth's climate have yielded a rather detailed understanding of carbon in the atmosphere and in biota. Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is far less well characterized, principally because it exists as a highly diluted mixture of perhaps millions of organic compounds in a highly saline aqueous solution. Prior to 2007, only around 1/3 of marine DOM was typically recovered from seawater for research purposes, regardless of the method of isolation. In 2007, reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED) were coupled to achieve recoveries of 64-93% of marine DOM. The level of residual salts in the concentrated samples, however, still precluded the characterization of marine DOM by solid-state NMR, mass spectrometry, or even elemental analysis. This paper describes a major improvement to the RO/ED method, in which pulsed ED is used (at sea) to reach roughly 100-fold greater removal of salts compared to non-pulsed ED while maintaining comparable recoveries of DOM.

Seasonal and spatial variability in dissolved organic matter quantity and composition from the Yukon River basin, Alaska	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The seasonal and spatial variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and chemical composition were investigated in the Yukon River basin of Alaska, United States, and northwestern Canada. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chromophoric DOM (CDOM), and dissolved lignin phenols were measured across a range of source waters and the seasonal hydrograph. Strong relationships were determined between CDOM and both DOC and lignin phenols, highlighting the potential for deriving detailed spatial and temporal distributions of DOM composition from CDOM monitoring. Maximum concentrations of measured parameters were observed during the spring flush, when DOM had a remarkably high content of aromatic vascular plant material derived from surface soil and litter layers. A larger portion of riverine DOM was attributed to vascular plant sources than previously believed by utilizing representative vegetation leachates and a soil pore water as end-members. In combination with recent studies highlighting export of young, labile DOM during the spring flush in northern high-latitude river systems, our results suggest riverine DOM is less degraded and more labile than previously thought with clear ramifications for its biomineralization or photo-oxidation in marine environments.																	0886-6236	1944-9224				OCT 3	2008	22	4							GB4002	10.1029/2008GB003231						WOS:000259803500001		
J	Yamashita, Y; Jaffe, R				Yamashita, Youhei; Jaffe, Rudolf			Characterizing the interactions between trace metals and dissolved organic matter using excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is composed of a variety of organic compounds, which can interact with metals in aquatic environments. The interactions between DOM and two metals of environmental concern (Cu(II) and Hg(II)) were studied using fluorescence quenching titrations combined with excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). This allowed characterizing the specific interactions between eight fluorescent components in DOM and two metals. Triplicate titration experiments showed good reproducibility when assessing the interactions between humic-like components with Cu(II). Our data show clear differences in metal-DOM interaction for samples of different DOM composition and between two different metals. The results demonstrate that the combination of fluorescence quenching titrations with EEM-PARAFAC was reproducible and sensitive to determine the binding properties of humic-like components with trace metals. The enhancement in fluorescence intensity after its initial decrease for the protein-like components with addition of Cu(II) was observed at mangrove-dominated sites, suggesting changes in the molecular environments of protein-like components due to increased Cu(II) interaction. The application of EEM-PARAFAC in fluorescence quenching studies is a useful tool to evaluate intermolecular DOM and DOM-trace metals interactions.

Removal of dissolved organic matter by anion exchange: Effect of dissolved organic matter properties	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Ten isolates of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) were evaluated to determine the effect that chemical properties of the DOM, such as charge density, aromaticity, and molecular weight, have on DOM removal by anion exchange. The DOM isolates were characterized as terrestrial, microbial, or intermediate humic substances or transphilic acids. All anion exchange experiments were conducted using a magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) resin. The charge density of the DOM isolates, determined by direct potentiometric titration, was fundamental to quantifying the stoichiometry of the anion exchange mechanism. The results clearly show that all DOM isolates were removed by anion exchange; however, differences among the DOM isolates did influence their removal by MIEX resin. In particular, MIEX resin had the greatest affinity for DOM with high charge density and the least affinity for DOM with low charge density and low aromaticity. This work illustrates that the chemical characteristics of DOM and solution conditions must be considered when evaluating anion exchange treatment for the removal of DOM.

J	Flynn, KJ; Clark, DR; Xue, Y				Flynn, Kevin J.; Clark, Darren R.; Xue, Yao			Modeling the release of dissolved organic matter by phytoplankton	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Three models describing dissolved organic matter (DOM) flux and phytoplankton death, each of different levels of complexity, were constructed and tested against experimental data for a cyanobacterium, a chlorophyte, two diatoms, two dinoflagellates, and two prymnesiophytes. The simplest model described only bulk carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) forms of DOM (DOMC and DOMN) and employed a fixed relationship between phytoplankton nutrient status and DOM release and death rate. The most complex model described fractions of DOM as low molecular weight dissolved organic carbon (DOC; saccharides, low molecular weight carbohydrates [DOCs]), low molecular weight nitrogenous material (comprising C and N as DOC associated with low molecular weight compounds containing amino acids and/or nucleic acids [DOCa] and N associated with DOCa [DONa], which included dissolved free amino acids [DFAA]), and more complex materials (DOC associated with high molecular weight compounds typically requiring extracellular degradation prior to uptake or use by microbes [DOCx] and N associated with DOCx [DONx]). It also employed descriptions of DOM flux and cell death related to nutrient status and growth rates. In all instances, material lysed from dead cells contributed to the DOM pool. All three models captured the gross dynamics of the primary data (dissolved inorganic C [DIC], dissolved inorganic N [DIN], particulate organic carbon [POC], particulate organic N [PON], DOC, dissolved organic N [DON]), but there was little or no improvement of the fit with increasing model complexity. However, the simplest models tended to employ excessively high growth rates to compensate for high fixed death rates. While the proportion of newly fixed C being liberated as DOMC (DOCs plus DOCa) increased as nutrient status declined, the actual rate of release typically did not do so and often declined. The most complex model gave predictions for changes in released saccharides and DFAA in keeping with expectations. The major obstacle to future progress is the lack of suitable, mass balanced data sets for further model testing.

Here, we test the hypothesis that freezing and thawing triggers N and dissolved organic matter (DOM) release from a forest soil after thawing and that low freezing temperatures enhance the effect. Undisturbed soil columns were taken from a soil at a Norway spruce site either comprising only O horizons or O horizons + mineral soil horizons. The columns were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing at temperatures of -3 degrees C, -8 degrees C, and -13 degrees C. The control columns were kept at constant +5 degrees C. Following the frost events, the columns were irrigated for 20 d at a rate of 4 mm d(-1). Percolates were analyzed for total N, mineral N, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The total amount of mineral N extracted from the O horizons in the control amounted to 8.6 g N m(-2) during the experimental period of 170 d. Frost reduced the amount of mineral N leached from the soil columns with -8 degrees C and -13 degrees C being most effective. In these treatments, only 3.1 and 4.0 g N m(-2) were extracted from the O horizons. Net nitrification was more negatively affected than net ammonification. Severe soil frost increased the release of DOC from the O horizons, but the effect was only observed in the first freeze-thaw cycle. We found no evidence for lysis of microorganisms after soil frost. Our experiment did not confirm the hypothesis that soil frost increases N mineralization after thawing. The total amount of additionally released DOC was rather low in relation to the expected annual fluxes.																	1436-8730					OCT	2008	171	5					699	706		10.1002/jpln.200700154						WOS:000260442500006

Spatial and temporal distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence and its contribution to light attenuation in UK waterbodies	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Vertical attenuation of light through the water column (K-d) is attributable to the optically active components of phytoplankton, suspended particulate material (SPM) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Of these, CDOM is not routinely monitored and was the main focus of this study. Concentrations and spatio-temporal patterns of CDOM fluorescence were investigated between August 2004 and March 2006, to quantify the correlation coefficient between CDOM and salinity and to better characterise the contribution of CDOM to Kd. Sampling was conducted at a broad range of UK and Republic of Ireland locations; these included more than 15 estuaries, 30 coastal and 70 offshore sites in the southern North Sea, Irish Sea, Liverpool Bay, Western Approaches and the English Channel. An instrument package was used; a logger with multi-sensor array was deployed vertically through the water column and concurrent water samples were taken to determine salinity, CDOM fluorescence and SPM. Surface CDOM fluorescence values ranged between 0.05 and 16.80 S.Fl.U. (standardised fluorescence units). A strong, negative correlation coefficient of CDOM to salinity (r(2) = 0.81) was found. CDOM absorption (aCDOM lambda) was derived from fluorescence measurements and was in the range 0.02-2.2 m(-1) with mean 0.15 m(-1). These results were comparable with direct measurements of aCDOM lambda in the same geographic regions. as published by other workers. Spatial differences in CDOM fluorescence were generally explicable by variation in salinity, in local conditions or catchment areas; e.g. CDOM at the freshwater end was 3.54-11.30 S.Fl.U., reflecting the variety of rivers sampled and their different catchments. Temporal changes in CDOM fluorescence were related to salinity. A significant and positive correlation was found between CDOM and K-d, and although CDOM was found to be less influential than SPM on K-d, it was still of significance particularly in coastal and offshore waters of lower turbidity.

The three key characteristics of the RP method are: (a) The C18-RP column chosen provides enhanced separation when the aqueous phase is 100% buffer-free water. and it does not degrade over time; (b) the water eluent adjusted to pH 7 significantly improves the resolution of water soluble compounds; (c) the initial flow maintained at low levels improves the separation of polar compounds. In samples, containing "fresh" DOM, specific peaks were detected, which were absent in "old" DOM samples. The combination with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) also demonstrated the relation between polarity and molecular size of DOM. FT-ICR-MS was applied to evaluate the quality of separation on a molecular scale demonstrating that physico-chemical characteristics of DOM can be related to molecular formulas. Sample extracts were separated into 4 preparative fractions, and a large suite of the identified molecular formulas only occurred in specific fractions. This is an important basis for the application of further analytical techniques in order to perform a more target-oriented analysis aiming at the determination of source and process biomarkers for DOM.

Three fractions: hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPI) and hydrophilic (HPI) accounting respectively for 35%, 20% and 45% of extracted carbon, are isolated from effluents of a major French wastewater treatment plant. This atypical DOC distribution, in comparison with natural water where the HPO fraction dominates, shows the significance of HPI fraction which often gets neglected because of extraction difficulties. A number of analytical techniques (elemental, spectroscopic: UV, FTIR) allow highlighting the weak aromaticity of wastewater effluent DOM (EfOM) due to fewer degradation and condensation processes and the strong presence of proteinaceous structures indicative of intense microbial activity. Copper toxicity in the presence of DOM is estimated using an acute toxicity test on Daphnia Magna (Strauss). Results reveal the similar protective role of each EfOM fraction compared to reference Suwannee river fulvic acid despite lower EfOM aromaticity (i.e. specific UV absorbance). The environmental implications of these results are discussed with respect to the development of site-specific water quality criteria. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among the causes of desertification, salinization induced by different factors is raising the greatest concern in the Mediterranean area. In the present research, hydrophilic (HI) and hydrophobic (HO) fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from soils at different degrees of salinization have been investigated by means of spectroscopic techniques such as tridimensional fluorescence spectroscopy in the mode of emission excitation matrix (EEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The FT-IR spectra were distinctive in differentiating HI from HO fractions and each DOM fraction as a function of soil salinity. The EEM spectra of HO fractions exhibited a shift toward longer emission wavelengths and higher fluorescence intensity (FI) values as compared to that of the HI fractions. These results could be ascribed to the different molecular complexities of HI and HO fractions. Further, a marked quenching effect was observed in the FI of both the DOM fractions with increasing soil salinity, which allowed to obtain immediate information on the soil salinity degree by comparing the fluorescence intensity.																	1863-0650					SEP	2008	36	9					748	753		10.1002/clen.200800033						WOS:000259523800004

Utilization of Spartina- and Phragmites-derived dissolved organic matter by bacteria and ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) from Delaware Bay salt marshes	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Phragmites australis has been invading Spartina-alterniflora-dominated salt marshes throughout the mid-Atlantic. Although, Phragmites has high rates of primary production, it is not known whether this species supports lower trophic levels of a marsh food web in the same manner as Spartina. Using several related photochemical and biological assays, we compared patterns of organic matter flow of plant primary production through a key salt marsh metazoan, the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa), using a bacterial intermediate. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was derived from plants collected from a Delaware Bay salt marsh and grown in the laboratory with (14)C-CO(2). Bacterial utilization of plant-derived DOM measured as carbon mineralization revealed that both species provided bioavailable DOM to native salt marsh bacteria. Total carbon mineralization after 19 days was higher for Spartina treatments (36% (14)CO(2)+/- 3 SE) compared with Phragmites treatments (29% +/- 2 SE; Wilcoxon-Kruskal-Wallis rank sums test, P < 0.01). Pre-exposing DOM to natural sunlight only enhanced or decreased bioavailability of the DOM to the bacterioplankton during initial measurements (e.g., 7 days or less) but these differences were not significant over the course of the incubations. Mixtures of (14)C-labeled bacterioplankton (and possibly organic flocs) from (14)C-DOM treatments were cleared by G. demissa at similar rates between Spartina and Phragmites treatments. Moreover, (14)C assimilation efficiencies for material ingested by mussels were high for both plant sources ranging from 74% to 90% and not significantly different between plant sources. Sunlight exposure did not affect the nutritional value of the bacterioplankton DOM assemblage for mussels. There are many possible trophic and habitat differences between Spartina- and Phragmites-dominated marshes that could affect G. demissa but the fate of vascular plant dissolved organic carbon in the DOM to bacterioplankton to mussel trophic pathway appears comparable between these marsh types.

Dissolved Organic Matter in the Great Lakes: Role and Nature of Allochthonous Material	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and the modifying influence of light on DOM bioavailability were investigated along a natural gradient of allochthonous influence in the lower Great Lakes. Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), three DOM fluorophores were identified. One fluorophore, previously identified as peak C, was of allochthonous (component 1) origin and two previously uncharacterized fluorophores were identified as autochthonous (components 2 and 3). Component I was photoreactive and the dominant form in creek water samples while components 2 and 3 were dominant in Hamilton Harbour and lake water samples. Components 2 and 3 showed limited photo reactivity. Exposure to full spectrum irradiance decreased the average molecular weight of DOM (i.e., increased the absorbance ratio (a254:a365)) for all water samples. DOM bioavailability was lowest in creek and highest in lake water samples and was inversely related to DOM average molecular weight. Photomodification of DOM resulted in higher bacterial activity although these differences were not significantly different. This suggests that light plays a significant role in the cycling of terrestrially-derived DOM and to a certain extent autochthonous DOM, potentially increasing metabolism of both terrestrially and microbially derived DOM in the Great Lakes aquatic ecosystems.																	0380-1330					SEP	2008	34	3					383	394		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[383:DOMITG]2.0.CO;2						WOS:000259885100001

Three terrestrial humic-like, one marine humic-like, and three non-humic-like fluorescent components were identified by PARAFAC, and the environmental dynamics of individual fluorescent components in the bay area were evaluated. The observed linear relationships between salinity and abundance of two of the three humic-like components in the bay area indicate a terrestrial origin and conservative mixing behavior of these components. On the other hand, nonconservative mixing for the other terrestrial and the marine humic-like components was observed, indicating that the sources of these were other than solely riverine inputs. Thus, in addition to riverine sources, this terrestrial humic-like component may receive inputs from biogeochemical reworking of terrestrial DOM and/or particulate organic matter, while the most likely sources for the marine humic-like component are estuarine biological activity and/or microbial reworking of plankton-derived DOM. From the spatial distributions in the bay area as well as their relationships with salinity, two of the non-humic-like components were suggested to be of autochthonous estuarine origin and likely represent biologically labile components. Microbial degradation processes were suggested to be important factors driving the dynamics of another non-humic-like component. This study exemplifies the potential applicability of EEM-PARAFAC in studies of fluorescent DOM dynamics in estuaries.

Spatial and temporal variability of solar ultraviolet exposure of coral assemblages in the Florida Keys: Importance of colored dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation can have deleterious effects on coral assemblages in tropical and subtropical marine environments, but little information is available on UV penetration into ocean waters surrounding corals. Here we provide an extensive data set of optical properties in the UV domain (280[en] 400 nm) that were obtained during 1998-2005 at sites located in the Lower and Middle Keys and the Dry Tortugas. Absorption coefficients of the colored component of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC; colored dissolved organic matter [CDOM]) were 63 to 253 larger than particulate absorption coefficients in the UV region, indicating that CDOM controls UV penetration in the inshore coastal waters and reef tract. CDOM absorption coefficients (a(CDOM)) and DOC were highly correlated to diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-d) in the UV spectral region. Measurements using moored sensors showed that UV penetration at the reef tract in the Lower Keys varies significantly from day to day and diurnally. The diurnal variations were linked to tidal currents that transport CDOM over the reef tract. Summertime stratification of Case 1 bluewaters near the reef tract during periods of low wind resulted in higher temperatures and UV penetration than that observed during well-mixed conditions. This result suggests that higher UV exposure accompanying ocean warming during low-wind doldrums conditions significantly contributes to coral bleaching. Modeling results indicate that changes in underwater sunlight attenuation over the coral reefs can affect UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and inhibition of coral photosynthesis much more strongly than changes in the stratospheric ozone layer.

Salt marshes as a source of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to Southern California coastal waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To determine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) sources in Southern California coastal waters, optical properties of a river outlet and adjacent tidally flushed salt marshes were monitored (dry season; June July 2001). Average absorption coefficients doubled at ebb vs. flood tides (4.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.9 m(-1); 300 nm), suggesting significant salt marsh CDOM inputs into coastal waters. Average spectral slopes were not statistically different for any sites or tides (0.010 +/- 0.002 nm(-1)), consistent with salt marsh CDOM dominating coastal waters. Three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) at ebb tide showed contributions from terrestrial, protein, and marine humic-like peaks, suggesting production and output of these materials from the marsh. A marine humic signal at the river outlet during an offshore upwelling event indicated an additional sporadic nonmarsh marine humic-like source. EEMs of six common salt marsh plant leachates showed protein, terrestrial, and marine humic-like peaks. To estimate CDOM photodegradation in the marsh, fluorescence intensity decays from photobleaching experiments were fit to first-order kinetics. Most humic peaks degraded with a half-life of t(1/2) = 10-20 h, which overlaps the estimated residence time of water in the marshes (similar to 12 h). Most protein peaks were resistant to photodegradation, suggesting that the low levels of protein vs. humic-like material measured in natural waters was due to rapid bioutilization of proteinaceous material. The rapid photodegradation of plant leachate humic material and the low spectral slopes for the field sites suggest that marsh sediments would be an important source of CDOM.

J	Yamashita, Y; Tanoue, E				Yamashita, Youhei; Tanoue, Eiichiro			Production of bio-refractory fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the ocean interior	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Dissolved organic matter in the ocean constitutes one of the largest pools of reduced carbon on the Earth's surface(1,2), but its role in the global carbon cycle is poorly understood. A large part of this pool is thought to be of marine origin(2-4) and to be composed of constituents that are resistant to biological degradation(3-6). It is not clear how this refractory fraction of the carbon pool is produced in the ocean. Here, we analyse observations of fluorescence intensity and apparent oxygen utilization in the interior of the Pacific Ocean, and find that the two parameters are linearly related in the mesopelagic and abyssal layers. We conclude that fluorescent dissolved organic matter is produced in situ in the ocean interior as organic matter is oxidized biologically, and that it is resistant to biological degradation on centennial to millennial timescales. The rate of production of bio-refractory fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the ocean interior is larger than the riverine input of terrestrial humic substances, suggesting that its in situ production is one of the key processes in maintaining the oceanic pool of refractory dissolved organic matter.

Eleven sites representative of these habitats were sampled on six dates to encompass seasonal variability. Using a suite of qualitative analyses, including specific DBP formation potential, absorbance, fluorescence, lignin content and composition, C and N stable isotopic compositions, and structural groupings determined using CPMAS (cross polarization, magic angle spinning) C-13 NMR, we applied a geochemical fingerprinting approach to characterize the DOM from different Delta habitats, and infer DOM and DBP precursor sources and estimate the relative contribution from different sources. Although river input was the predominant source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), we observed that 13-49% of the DOC exported from the Delta originated from Sources within the Delta, depending on season. Interaction with shallow wetlands and subsided islands significantly increased DOC and DBP precursor concentrations and affected DOM composition, while deep open water habitats had little discernable effect. Shallow wetlands contributed the greatest amounts of DOM and DBP precursors in the spring and summer, in contrast to island drains which appeared to be an important source during winter months. The DOM derived from wetlands and island drains had greater haloacetic acid precursor content relative to incoming river water, while two wetlands contributed DOM with greater propensity to form trihalomethanes. These results are pertinent to restoration of the Delta. Large scale introduction of shallow wetlands, a proposed restoration strategy, could alter existing DOC and DBP precursor concentrations, depending on their hydrologic connection to Delta channels.

J	Scelza, R; Rao, MA; Gianfreda, L				Scelza, Rosalia; Rao, Maria Antonietta; Gianfreda, Liliana			Response of an agricultural soil to pentachlorophenol (PCP) contamination and the addition of compost or dissolved organic matter	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												The response of a fresh, agricultural soil when contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP) and supplemented with compost (C) or dissolved organic matter (DOM) was studied in the laboratory. The concentration of PCP and the changes in various functionally related properties (i.e. microbial biomass, basal respiration, soil hydrolase and oxidoreductase activity) were measured over 150 d. Variations in the main physical and chemical properties of the soils were also monitored. Two different doses of compost (C1=0.27% and C2 = 0.83%, corresponding to 10 and 30 t ha(-1). respectively) or DOM (D1 = 0.07% and D2=0.2%) equivalent to the carbon content of the two compost doses C1 and C2 were used and the following five systems were investigated: soil (S), soil-compost (S-C1 and S-C2) and soil-DOM (S-D1 and S-D2). PCP concentrations declined progressively and significantly with time. This effect was most pronounced for the soils amended with the lower compost dose CI (S-Cl) and with the two DOM (S-D1 and S-D2) amounts. Significantly reduced amounts of PCP were extracted after its 500-d residence in the various systems. Higher amounts of the residual PCP were extracted from the humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and humin-mineral (HU) fractions of the 500 d aged samples than from the same unfractionated samples, indicating that the residual PCP preferentially accumulated in the organic fractions of soil. The soil showed an endogenous microbial activity as indicated by basal respiration, microbial biomass and all the enzymatic activities tested (dehydrogenase, glucosidase, phosphatase, arylsulphatase and urease). Addition of the PCP severely depressed some of the tested biochemical properties suggesting an inhibitory effect on microbial activity. Conversely, higher basal respiration, and similar beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activities were measured in comparison with the controls. No significant effects were observed following the addition of two doses of the compost or the DOM. Fungal colonies belonging to the taxonomic group of Ascomycetes and identified as Byssochlamys fulva developed with time in all the PCP-contaminated samples. Growth of B. fulva in vitro in the presence of PCP showed that the isolate was tolerant to 12.5 and 25 mg l(-1) PCP and degraded 20% of its initial concentration in 8 d. Overall, the results indicate that many complex processes occurred in the contaminated soil and combinations of these determined the response to PCP contamination. The sorption of PCP to the soil matrix (which increased with time) and its degradation/transformation by indigenous soil microbial activity were likely involved. Both the processes appeared to be favoured by the presence of dissolved organic matter. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dissolved organic matter accumulation, reactivity, and redox state in ground water of a recharge wetland	WETLANDS												Ground water beneath the seasonal swamp of the Okavango Delta, a recharge wetland in northwestern Botswana, is known to be a sink for solutes. In this study, measurements of organic carbon and inorganic ion concentrations, as well as UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy, were used to examine dissolved organic matter (DOM) storage and redox state of fulvic acids in ground water beneath an island and riparian woodland. Increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations along the ground-water flowpath suggests an accumulation of DOM in ground water, especially beneath island centers. However, the increase in DOC concentration was relatively less than the increase in chloride and sulfate concentrations, indicating non-conservative behavior of DOM in ground water beneath wetland islands. In combination with a decrease in fulvic acid content and specific UV absorbance, this result suggests that preferential sorption or destabilization of more aromatic organic compounds may be occurring under conditions of high pH and salinity. Finally, the increase in reduced fluorescence components (semiquinone- and hydroquinone-like components) along the ground-water flowpath strongly supports the transition to reduced fulvic acids in ground water of island centers. The reactivity and potential electron-shuttling function of fulvic acids may play an important role in the dissolution of metal oxides and associated DOM-iron-arsenic interactions in ground water of this recharge wetland.

J	Xue, S; Zhao, QL; Wei, LL; Jia, T				Xue, Shuang; Zhao, Qing-Liang; Wei, Liang-Liang; Jia, Ting			Effect of bromide ion on isolated fractions of dissolved organic matter in secondary effluent during chlorination	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												The role of bromide ion in the trihalomethane (THM) formation and structure of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during chlorination of the secondary effluent taken from the Wenchang Wastewater Treatment Plant (Harbin, China) was investigated. DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The patterns of individual THM species with increased bromide concentrations were similar for all DOM fractions. The THM speciation as well as halogen fraction for these five fractions followed similar trends with the Br-/C12 ratio. Chlorination resulted in decreased ultraviolet (UV) absorbance across wavelengths from 250 to 280 nm for DOM fractions whether bromide ions existed or not, and bromide addition led to lower differential UV absorbance values. Fouri er-trans form infrared (FT-11R) results indicated that chlorination, whether bromide ions existed or not, resulted in the near elimination of aromatic C-H and amide peaks, increased C-0 absorption intensity and occurrence of C=O and C-Cl peaks for HPO-A. HPO-N, TPI-A and TPI-N. Furthermore, bromide addition in chlorination led to the occurrence of C-Br peak for all four fractions. (c) 2007 Elsevier 13N.

The proton, curium, and europium binding properties of the OPA pore water and the extracted DOM of both rocks were studied with acid-base titrations, time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), and voltammetry, respectively. Protons were mostly buffered by inorganic compounds. DOM contributed to the total proton buffering capacity of the samples only to a small extent. Significant complexation of curium by DOM was observed for OPA pore water by TRFLS in contrast to little complexation by DOM detected in the OPA and COx extracts. The data on europium binding in OPA pore water were described by the presence of 14.3 mu M organic ligands exhibiting a conditional affinity constant of log beta = 6.50. Calculations of europium speciation under in situ conditions indicated that carbonates largely controlled the speciation of europium in OPA and COx. In the OPA formation, the presence of DOM may enhance the solubility of europium by 5 x 10(-8) M, representing about one-third of total dissolvable europium.

Sedimentation in boreal lakes - The role of flocculation of allochthonous dissolved organic matter in the water column	ECOSYSTEMS												We quantified sedimentation of organic carbon in 12 Swedish small boreal lakes (< 0.48 km(2)), which ranged in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from 4.4 to 21.4 mg C l(-1). Stable isotope analysis suggests that most of the settling organic matter is of allochthonous origin. Annual sedimentation of allochthonous matter per m(2) lake area was correlated to DOC concentration in the water (R(2) = 0.41), and the relationship was improved when sedimentation data were normalized to water depth (R(2) = 0.58). The net efflux of C as CO(2) from the water to the atmosphere was likewise correlated to DOC concentration (R(2) = 0.52). The losses of organic carbon from the water column via mineralization to CO(2) and via sedimentation were approximately of equal importance throughout the year. Our results imply that DOC is a precursor of the settling matter, resulting in an important pathway in the carbon cycle of boreal lakes. Thus, flocculation of DOC of terrestrial origin and subsequent sedimentation could lead to carbon sequestration by burial in lake sediments.

J	Song, NH; Chen, L; Yang, H				Song, Ning Hui; Chen, Liang; Yang, Hong			Effect of dissolved organic matter on mobility and activation of chlorotoluron in soil and wheat	GEODERMA												Chlorotoluron is a pesticide that is moderately absorbed and fairly mobile and leaching in soils. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a critical role in affecting the environmental behavior of pesticides. In this study, we report the effect of DOM extracted from sludge (SL) and straw (ST) on chlorotoluron sorption/desorption and mobility using several techniques including batch experiment, soil column, soil thin-layer chromatography and bioefficacy estimation. Application of DOM (SL and ST) at 50 and 150 mg DOC L(-1) decreased the sorption of and increased desorption of chlorotoluron in soils. Freundlich constant K(f) values (sorption) of chlorotoluron for SL1 (50 mg DOC L(-1) sludge extract) and SL2 (150 mg DOC L(-1) sludge extract) treatments were 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, which were significantly lower than the value (0.29) for the control. The respective values for treatments of M (50 mg DOC L(-1) straw extract) and ST2 (150 mg DOC L(-1) straw extract) were 0.04 and 0.02. Mobility of chlorotoluron was tested in packed soil columns and soil plate. Addition of DOM to both systems significantly increased the mobility of chlorotoluron and the total concentration of chlorotoluron in the leachate in columns. Biological analysis with wheat plant revealed that application of DOM reduced the chlorotoluron accumulation in tissues at lower concentration of chlorotoluron and increased its accumulation at higher level of chlorotoluron. Finally, we analyzed FT-IR spectral and fluorescence for DOMs and found that more unsaturated components and amine were present in DOM-ST than in DOM-SL These results may help our understanding of the general role of DOMs in regulating the activation and mobility of organic chemicals (e.g. herbicide and contaminants) in the ecosystem.

Here we describe the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from OM-rich sedimentary rocks under simulated weathering conditions. Results from column experiments demonstrate slow, sustained release of DOM from ancient sedimentary rocks under simulated weathering conditions. (1)H-NMR analysis of shale-derived DOM reveals a highly aliphatic, carbohydrate-poor material distinct from other natural DOM pools. Shale-derived DOM is rapidly assimilated and biodegraded by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. Consequently, no compositional signature of shale-derived DOM other than (14)C-depletion is likely to persist in rivers or other surface reservoirs. Combined, these efforts show that dissolution provides a mechanism for the conversion of refractory kerogen into labile biomass, linking rock weathering with sedimentary OM oxidation and the delivery of aged OM to rivers and ocean margins.																	0886-6236					JUL 3	2008	22	3							GB3002	10.1029/2007GB002980						WOS:000257431400001

In several studies it had been demonstrated that factors such as vegetation and substrates type affected the treatment efficiency of DOM, while very few studies discerned their influence on the transformations of DOM. Thus three pilot-scale HSSF CWs, i.e. reed (Phragmites australis)lgravel bed (W1), hybrid vegetation {cattail (Typha latifolia), bulrush (Scirpus validus), reed)/gravel bed (W2) and reed/hybrid substrates bed (gravel, zeolite, slag) (W3), were designed, and were operated continuously to investigate soluble COD (SCOD) removal and DOM transformations affected by vegetation and substrate type, and to explore the correlation between SCOD and biodiversity. The results showed that cattail and bulrush contributed to higher SCOD removal than common reed, and that gravel, zeolite and slag did not show significant influence on SCOD removal. The composition of the dissolved. organic carbon (DOC) could undergo a considerable shift in composition due to metabolism and senescence from plant and microorganism. Nonlabile aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl hydrocarbons in the effluent were a significant portion compared with labile alcoholic and alkene in the influent. It was also observed that the type of vegetation and substrate had great influence on the structure of bacteria, and the Shannon-Wiener Index increased linearly with the decrease of SCOD concentration along water flow in W2 and W3 (R(2) = 0.96).

Over 99% of the DOM in fresh leachate was removed upon 3-7 years of landfill, leaving only DOM with strong fluorescent activity. Anoxic or aerobic treatment of landfill leachate can further degrade DOM of MW < 300 Da and transform those with fluorescent activity of MW > 10(5) Da to those of 2000-10(5) Da. Neither landfilling nor storage in anoxic pond effectively removed estrogenic potential of leachate. Fractionation test revealed that residual organic matters of MW 3000-14000 Da and of < 600 Da with high UV254 contributed most of the estrogenic activities in leachate.

We studied adsorption and fractionation of hydrophobic acid (HoA) and hydrophobic neutral (HoN) fractions of DOM on Cu(2+)- and Fe(3+)-montmorillonite. Adsorption of both samples was higher on Fe(3+)-montmorillonite than on Cu(2+)-montmorillonite. A pH increase of about one unit was recorded followed by HoA adsorption by Fe(3+)-montmorillonite. This suggested exchange of negatively charged DOM groups on surface hydroxyl groups of Fe(3+)-montmorillonite surfaces. Adsorption of HoA on Cu(2+)-montmorillonite and HoN on Fe(3+)- and Cu(2+)-montmorillonites was governed mainly by van der Waals interactions. Spectroscopic analyses showed a distinct HoA fractionation by molecular size and aromaticity only by Fe(3+)-montmorillonite. On the basis of the pH measurements (increase in pH following adsorption of acid components) and enhanced DOM fractionation by molecular size and aromaticity we suggest that DOM reacted with Fe(3+)-montmorillonite similar to goethite.																	0013-936X					JUL 1	2008	42	13					4797	4803		10.1021/es8003602						WOS:000257220600034	18678008

J.; Ortega-Calvo, Jose-Julio			Enhanced kinetics of solid-phase microextraction and biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The uptake kinetics of fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[e]pyrene by solid-phase microextraction fibers was studied in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) obtained from sediment pore water and resulted in increased fiber absorption and desorption rate coefficients. Compared to the control without DOM, these rate coefficients were increased at a DOM concentration of 36.62 mg/L by a factor of 1.27 to 2.21 and 1.31 to 2.10 for fluorene and benzo[e]pyrene, respectively. The calculated values for the fiber absorption and desorption rate coefficients show that diffusion through an unstirred boundary layer (UBL) surrounding the fiber probably forms the rate-limiting step of the process. The mineralization of aqueous-phase phenanthrene and pyrene by a representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacterium (Mycobacterium gilvum VM552) also was found to be enhanced by DOM. The initial degradation rates of phenanthrene (9.03 mu g/L) and pyrene (1.96 mu g/L) were significantly higher compared to the control values and were enhanced by a factor of 1.32 and 1.26 at a DOM concentration of 43.14 and 42.15 mg/L, respectively. We suggest that such an enhancement results from the combination of faster uptake kinetics of the water-dissolved compounds in the UBL surrounding microbial cells and direct access of the bacteria to DOM-associated PAHs. These enhanced kinetic effects of DOM may have strong implications in sediment processes like desorption, nonequilibrium exposure, and biodegradation.

Using XAD-8/XAD-4 resins, DOM was fractionated into five classes: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). Subsequently, the water quality parameters of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), absorbance of ultraviolet light at 254 nm (UV-254), specific ultraviolet light absorbance (SUVA) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) were analyzed for the unfractionated and fractionated water samples. The results showed that the order of the DOC removal with respect to DOM fractions was observed to be HPI > HPO-A > HPO-N > TPI-A > TPI-N. During the GAC treatment, the THMFP of the unfractionated water samples decreased from 397.4 mu g/L to 176.5 mu g/L, resulting in a removal efficiency of 55.6%. The removal order of the trihalomethanes (THMs) precursor was as follows: HPO-A > TPI-A > TPI-N > HPO-N > HPI. By the GAC treatment, the specific THMFP of HPO-A, TPI-A, TPI-N and the original unfractionated water samples had a noticeable decrease, while that of HPO-N and HPI showed a converse trend. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results showed that the hydroxide groups, carboxylic acids, aliphatic C-H were significantly reduced by GAC treatment.																	1673-565X					JUL	2008	9	7					994	1003		10.1631/jzus.A071508						WOS:000257464500017

Long-term photochemical and microbial decomposition of wetland-derived dissolved organic matter with alteration of C-13 : C-12 mass ratio	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the long-term photochemical and microbial decomposition of biologically recalcitrant humic-like dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from a vascular wetland plant, the common rush (Juncus effusus). Although the leachate would have been characterized as biologically recalcitrant by short-term (<14 d) bioassays, microbes decomposed 51% of its organic carbon in 898 d with a first-order biological decomposition coefficient of 0.0008 d(-1) in darkness. Solar radiation exposure accelerated the decomposition of leachate. Under 459-d exposure to surface solar radiation, up to 90% of organic carbon was mineralized. During the exposure, the photochemical reactions preferentially mineralized the C-12 fraction of organic carbon and enriched the C-13 of organic carbon by 6% in the residual leachate. Solar radiation also decomposed nearly completely (up to 99.7%) chromo- and fluorophores of DOM. A 439-d bioassay following the solar radiation exposure resulted in up to 97.3% mineralization of organic carbon. Solar radiation together with microbial metabolism can completely mineralize at least some forms of wetland-derived DOM in surface waters with sufficiently long residence times.																	0024-3590					JUL	2008	53	4					1387	1392		10.4319/lo.2008.53.4.1387						WOS:000257773700017		
J	Arye, G; Hoffman, Y; Chen, Y				Arye, Gilboa; Hoffman, Yasmin; Chen, Yona			Reciprocal relation of surface tension and dissolved organic matter originating from top soil layer leachates	SOIL SCIENCE												The surface-active characteristics of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM) was studied in DOM solutions leached out from four OM-containing topsoils. A reciprocal relationship was obtained between the leaching dynamics of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the surface tension (gamma(L)) of these solutions: when the DOC decreased with cumulative leachate pore volumes, the gamma(L) increased and approached gamma(L) of the displacing solution (i.e., water). For all soil solutions, the corresponding gamma(L) versus log(DOC) exhibited a linear relationship, from which the surface excess (Gamma) and the average surface area (A, square nanometer) occupied by the surface-active DOM molecules were calculated based on the Gibbs equation. The calculated A values were of the same order of magnitude as those reported for some humic acids, but smaller. The nature of the displaced DOM solutions was further examined in terms of the effect of pH on the gamma(L), which exhibited a sigmoidal reduction with decreasing pH. From the E-2/E-3 ratio, it was deduced that with decreasing pH, the molecular size of the DOM molecules decreases, and consequently, so does A. Accordingly, the reduction in gamma(L) with increasing pH was explained by the protonation of acid functional groups, which imparts a more hydrophobic nature to the DOM molecules, but also by the reduction in molecular size, and consequently, in A.																	0038-075X					JUL	2008	173	7					480	488		10.1097/SS.0b013e318178e76f						WOS:000257731400006

Spectrophotometric properties of surface water dissolved organic matter in an afforested upland peat catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Many upland catchments in the UK have undergone afforestation; their characteristic waterlogged soils require extensive pre-plantation ground drainage to allow tree establishment. In peatland areas this can result in very highly coloured runoff and enhanced dissolved organic matter (DOM) export in rivers of naturally high concentrations. In 1966, the Coalburn Experimental Catchment, northern England, was established to investigate the impact of afforestation on an upland peat catchment. Here we report the variations in DOM spectrophotometric properties of streamflow in the catchment at canopy closure, especially with respect to potential carbon sources within the artificial drainage ditches. Drainage ditches are characterized by water that has higher absorption coefficients and which is more highly coloured than in the catchment tributaries. Ditched, afforested areas produce more highly-coloured runoff waters that are more fluorescent and absorbent normalized to carbon concentration compared to ditches in open moorland. Ditches that had been experimentally re-excavated have organic matter of different spectrophotometric character, with higher dissolved organic carbon concentration and less aromatic or lower molecular weight material. It is hypothesized that this is due to the exposure of bare peat faces within and adjacent to the ditches that are more susceptible to drying compared to vegetated areas. The large extent of this drainage network acts as both a rapid transport network increasing hydrological connectivity and a pool for the storage of DOM, which is of different spectrophotometric character under low flow conditions, depending on management conditions.

Measurements performed at increased concentrations of copper(II) ions showed successive saturation of active DOM sites which indicate possible partition of copper between (i) free or labile complexes, (ii) reduced and released within the potential window of the method, and (iii) electroinactive copper complexes. Pseudopolarograms measured at pH 4 indicate a release of copper which was bound to the active sites of DOM that formed non-labile complexes. Variation of the peak position and half-peak width along the scanned deposition potentials and with the increasing concentration of copper bear the information about the complex electrochemical processes at the electrode surface and in the bulk of the solution. Pseudopolarograms of zinc showed a strong dependence of the peak current and the peak position along the scanned deposition potentials on pH values, indicating preferentially complexation of zinc with carboxylic-like active sites of DOM in the measured sample. Pseudopolarography is a valuable method in the trace metal complexation and speciation studies, serving as a fingerprint of the analysed sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Molecular characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along a river to ocean transect of the lower Chesapeake Bay by ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry	MARINE CHEMISTRY												In this study, electrospray ionization coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) is utilized to molecularly characterize DOM as it is transported along a river to estuary to ocean transect of the lower Chesapeake Bay system. The ultrahigh resolving power (greater than 500,000) and mass accuracy of FTICR-MS allow for the resolution of the thousands of components in a single DOM sample, and can therefore elucidate the molecular-level changes that occur during DOM transformation from a terrestrial location to the marine environment. An important feature of FTICR-MS is that its sensitivity allows for direct analysis of low salinity samples without employing the traditional concentration approaches involving C-18 extraction or ultrafiltration. To evaluate the advantages of using direct analysis, a C-18 extract of riverine water is compared to its whole, unfractionated water, and it was determined that the C-18 extraction is selective in that it eliminates two major series of compounds. One group is aliphatic amines/amides that are not adsorbed to the C-18 disk because they exist as positive ions prior to extraction. The second group is tannin-like compounds with higher oxygen contents and a more polar quality that also allow them not to be adsorbed to the C-18 disk. This direct approach could not be used for brackish/saline waters, so the C-18 method is resorted to for those samples. Along the subject transect, a significant difference is observed in the molecular composition of DOM, as determined from assigned molecular formulas. The DOM tends to become more aliphatic and contain lower abundances of oxygen-rich molecules as one progresses from inshore to the offshore. A considerable amount of molecular formula overlap does exist between samples from sites along the transect. This can be explained as either the presence of refractory material that persists throughout the transect, due to its resistance to degradation, or that the assigned molecular formulas are the same but the chemical structures are different. ESI-FTICR-MS is a powerful technique for the investigation of DOM and has the ability to detect compositional variations along the river to ocean transect. Visualization tools such as two dimensional and three dimensional van Krevelen diagrams greatly assist in highlighting the shift from the more aromatic, terrestrial DOM to the more aliphatic, marine DOM.

Effect of undesalted dissolved organic matter from composts on persistence, adsorption, and mobility of cyhalofop herbicide in solis	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												The effect of undesalted dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from composts on the degradation, adsorption, and mobility of cyhalofop herbicide in soils was studied. A paddy-field sediment poor in organic matter (OM), an OM-rich forest soil, and DOM from agroindustrial or municipal waste compost were used. DOM increased the cyhalofop-acid but not the cyhalofop-butyl solubility in water. The degradation of cyhalofop-butyl in the sediment was slow, giving cyhalofop-acid as the only metabolite, whereas in forest soil, the process was faster, and three byproducts were detected. Soil pretreatment with DOM did not modify the degradation pattern but only reduced the adsorption of cyhalofop-butyl by soil, whereas it increased the adsorption of cyhalofop-acid. Among the. cationic components of DOM solutions, the potassium ion seems to be related to the increased adsorption of the cyhalofop-acid in both OM-poor and OM-rich soils, yielding reversible complexes with the former and favoring hydrophobic interactions with the latter.																	0021-8561					JUN 11	2008	56	11					4102	4111		10.1021/jf7036906						WOS:000256445300031	18476694

Understanding both chemical and physical characteristics of DOM in source waters is key to better water treatment. In this study, the DOM from four typical source waters in China was fractionated by XAD resin adsorption (RA) and ultrafiltration (UF) techniques. The trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of all fractions in the DOM were investigated to reveal the major THM precursors. The fraction distributions of DOM could be related to their geographical origins in a certain extent. The dominant chemical fraction as THM precursors in the DOM from south waters (East-Lake reservoir in Shenzhen and Peal rivers in Guangzhou) was hydrophobic acid (HoA). The size fraction with molecular weight (MW) < 1 kDa in both south waters had the highest THMFP. The results of cluster analysis showed that the parameters of fractions including DOC percentage (DOC%), UV(254)%, SUVA(254) (specific UV(254) absorbance) and THMFP were better for representing the differences of DOM from the studied waters than specific THMFP (STHMFP). The weak correlation between SUVA(254) and STHMFP for either size or XAD fractions suggests that whether SUVA(254) can be used as an indicator for the reactivity of THM formation is highly dependent on the nature of organic matter.				wei, qunshan/A-2352-2012	wei, qunshan/0000-0002-5484-4087												0167-6369					JUN	2008	141	1-3					347	357		10.1007/s10661-007-9901-1						WOS:000255627200030	17849227

This study determined the concentration of stable Cs and Sr, and U in the soil solution, under plant growing conditions. The leafy vegetable komatsuna (Brassica rapa L.) was cultivated for 26 days in pots, where the rhizosphere soil was separated from the non-rhizosphere soil by a nylon net screen. The concentrations of Cs and Sr in the rhizosphere soil solution decreased with time, and were controlled by K + NH4+ and Ca, respectively. On the other hand, the concentration of U in the rhizosphere soil solution increased with time, and was related to the changes of DOC; however, this relationship wits different between the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil.

The method does not require major instrumentation and can be performed in the field. Modified styrene divinyl benzene polymer type sorbents ( Varian PPL and ENV) and sorbents of a silica structure bonded with different hydrocarbon chains ( Varian C8, C18, C18OH, and C18EWP) were considered. Except for C18OH, which heavily contaminated the samples, none of the sorbents leached significant amounts of dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) or nitrogen ( DON). Samples from the North Brazil shelf with strong mixing gradients of terrigenous and marine DOM were used to compare the various sorbents. PPL was the most efficient - on average, 62% of DOC was recovered as salt-free extracts. C18 was found to be most efficient among the silica-based sorbents, but it showed only two- thirds of the extraction efficiency of PPL. As indicated by [ H-1] NMR, C/ N, and delta C-13 analyses, PPL extracted a more representative proportion of DOM than C18. Therefore, PPL was used for comparative studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Antarctica. From brackish marsh and river waters, 65% and 62% of total DOC, respectively, could be extracted. For purely marine DOM in Antarctica and the deep sea, the extraction efficiency was lower ( 43% on average). The efficiency of the new method to isolate marine DOM is better than or similar to highly laborious methods. A further advantage is the complete desalination of the sample. The isolation of a major DOM fraction, which is salt- free, offers many possibilities to further characterize DOM by advanced analytical techniques.

Naturally present fatty acids as internal calibrants for Fourier transform mass spectra of dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The analysis of dissolved organic matter ( DOM) by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ( FTICR- MS) has gained wide interest recently, driven primarily by its ultrahigh resolving power and mass accuracy. Accurate calibration of mass spectra is a key step to successfully decipher the DOM components. We propose a simple and accurate method to internally calibrate the peaks in the complex spectra without the need to add a calibrant. Mass spectra of DOM samples from the Dismal Swamp, Virginia, and the lower Chesapeake Bay display the presence of naturally occurring fatty acids which can be readily recognized and calibrated with accuracies < 0.1 ppm. Once calibrated with fatty acids, approximately 80% of all peaks in the DOM mass spectra can be assigned unique molecular formulas with accuracies < 0.4 ppm. Although the formula errors for the assigned molecular formulas do increase with increasing m/z, the dynamic range of the fatty acids used as calibrants is sufficient because high m/z values (> 600) have formulas with an average error of < 0.6 ppm. Because fatty acids are ubiquitous components of most DOM, this approach is applicable to a large variety of DOM samples.

This paper presents the concept of the newly developed DOM modules implemented in the DAISY model with focus on the quantification of DOM sorption/desorption and microbial-driven DOM turnover. The kinetics of DOM sorption/desorption is described by the deviation of the actual DOM concentration in solution from the equilibrium concentration, C-eq. The C-eq is Soil specific and estimated from pedotransfer functions taking into account the soil content of organic matter, Al and Fe oxides. The turnover of several organic matter pools including one DOM pool are described by first-order kinetics. The DOM module was tested at field scale for three soil treatments applied after cultivating grass-clover swards. Suction cups were installed at depths 30, 60 and 90 cm and soil solution was sampled for quantification of dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved organic N (DON). In the topsoil, the observed fluctuations in DOC were successfully simulated when the sorption/desorption rate coefficient k was low. In the subsoil, the observed concentrations of DOC were steadier and the best simulations were obtained using a high k. The model shows that DOC and DON concentrations are levelled out in the subsoils due to soil buffering. The steady concentration levels were based on the C-eq for each horizon and the kinetic concept for sorption/desorption of DOC appeared a viable approach. If C-eq was successfully estimated by the pedotransfer function it was possible to simulate the DOC concentration in the subsoil. In spite of difficulties in describing the DOC dynamics of the topsoil, the DOM module simulates the subsoil concentration level of DOC well, and also-but with more uncertainty-the DON concentration level.

Reduction of dissolved organic matter and trihalomethane formation potential during laboratory-scale soil-aquifer treatment	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in recovered groundwater from soil-aquifer treatment (SAT) has the potential to generate harmful disinfection by-products. This study investigated the reduction of mass and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of DOM fractions from secondary effluent during laboratory-scale SAT. Using XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins, DOM was fractionated into three fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), transphilic acid (TPI-A) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). HPO-A was removed by 61.1%, TPI-A by 54.9% and HPI by 75.0% as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during the laboratory-scale SAT, respectively. The reduction of THMFP from HPO-A, TPI-A and HPI was 27.24, 26.24 and 36.08%, respectively. Specific THMFP for each DOM fraction increased across the soil columns. HPO-A was found to be the major precursor of THMs. THMFP was strongly correlated to ultraviolet light at 254 nm (UV-254) for HPO-A and HPI, while the relationship between THMFP and UV-254 for TPI-A was significantly poor.																	1747-6585					JUN	2008	22	2					148	154		10.1111/j.1747-6593.2007.00093.x						WOS:000256157800009

Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) represents a major portion of the total DOM and has often been used as a tracer to identify the source or track the movement of DOM in aquatic environment. In this work, we have applied Excitation/Emission Matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) to study the distribution and characteristics of FDOM in seawater of Bohai Sea in Northern China. Hierarchical Cluster method has been used to assess the similarities and dissimilarities of the entire EEMs data sets of seawater samples collected from different regions of the Bohai Sea. The distribution of different seawater samples as revealed by multivariate results has been used to track the movement of DOM material in the Bay, and the results from such analysis are in good agreement with those obtained from seawater circulation and dynamics models.

There are still several million people suffering from drinking arsenic contaminated water. This work studied the performance of coupled chitosan/UF for arsenic removal and the influence of dissolved organic matter on arsenic removal with UF operation. Humic acid representing dissolved organic matter was fractionated into five groups of molecular sizes by gel filtration chromatography. Arsenic rejection by UF under the experimental condition is only 10%. In the presence of humic compounds, the arsenic removal of 22% is obtained. DOM with apparent molecular weight > 35,000 Da is the principle component responsible for chelating arsenic and thereafter being rejected by UF membrane. The combined interactions of humic compounds, chitosan, and arsenic enable a 65% arsenic rejection by UF. The results presented here enable our understanding of the complicated mechanisms involved in chitosan/UF/DOM/arsenic system. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Caplanne, S; Laurion, I				Caplanne, Sophie; Laurion, Isabelle			Effect of chromophoric dissolved organic matter on epilimnetic stratification in lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Empirical studies on lake thermal regimes have shown that stratification is correlated with the concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Thermal stratification has implications for photosynthesis, photoinhibition, photobleaching and carbon cycling. The objectives of this study were to quantify the role of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) on epilimnetic thermal structure and to estimate the contribution of ultraviolet (UV), visible and infrared radiation (IR) to the near-surface warming of lakes as a function of their DOM content. A simplified thermal model was applied, assuming all energy absorbed by the system is converted to heat and excluding mixing and heat losses. For the upper 0.5 m of the water column, the model generated a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees C after one hour of noon irradiance in a strongly humic lake, as compared to 1 degrees C in pure water. UV, visible light and IR contributed 6, 32 and 62% of warming in the humic lake, compared to 0, 5 and 95% in pure water. As CDOM absorption coefficient increases, UVA and especially visible light play an increasing role in stratification. Field data also support the significant role of CDOM absorption on near-surface thermocline occurrence. Near-surface stratification was a common feature during summer in a lake with a moderate DOC content (4.8 mg L(-1)) and color (a(320) = 16.4 m(-1) ). Based on a temperature-stability criterion of 0.2 degrees C m(-1) , this lake had a stable epilimnion 64% of the time, compared to 53% for a lake that had much lower DOC concentration (1.8 mg L(-1)) and color (3 m(-1)).																	1015-1621					MAY	2008	70	2					123	133		10.1007/s00027-007-7006-0						WOS:000256426400003		
J	Shoji, R				Shoji, Ryo			Effect of dissolved organic matter source on phytotoxicity to Lemna aequinoctialis	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on metal toxicity to aquatic organisms has been reported. Biotic ligand model (BLM) can account for this factor to predict metal toxicity. However, few attempts have been made to assess the effect of the DOM on metal phytotoxicity to duckweeds. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of DOM on copper toxicity to the duckweed Lemna aequinoctialis, and to determine if DOM concentration alone, regardless of DOM source, is an acceptable input parameter for the BLM for copper. Nine different DOM isolates from nine different sites in Japan were used in this study. A significant difference was observed between the lowest and the highest copper binding capacity. Phytotoxicity for copper decreased with increasing DOM concentration. These observations support use of the copper biotic Ligand model (BLM) with AFA% (active fulvic acid percent) as a regulatory tool to predict copper phytotoxicity on duckweeds. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

HSs were isolated from lakes, rivers, marsh, and ocean. Inclusion of humic,fulvic, hydrophobic organic, and hydrophilic organic acid fractions from these environments provided samples diverse in source and isolation protocol. In spite of these major differences, HS absorption coefficients (a) and photo re activities (a bleaching and CO production) were strongly dependent upon HS aromaticity (r(2) > 0.90; n = 11), implying aromatic moieties are the principal chromophores and photoreactants within HSs, and by extension, DOM. Carbonyl carbon and CO photoproduction were not correlated, implying that carbonyl moieties are not quantitatively important in CO photo production. CO photoproduction efficiency of aqueous solutions of monomeric aromatic compounds that are common constituents of organic matter varied with the nature of ring substituents. Specifically, electron donating groups increased, while electron withdrawing groups decreased CO photoproductivity, supporting our conclusion that carbonyl substituents are not quantitatively important in CO photo production. Significantly, aromatic CO photoproduction efficiency spanned 3 orders of magnitude, indicating that variations in the CO apparent quantum yields of natural DOM may be related to variations in aromatic DOM substituent group chemistry.

Batch cultures with lake-water bacteria and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) extracted from a humic boreal river were arranged in an experimental matrix of three levels of exposure to simulated sunlight and three levels of phosphorus concentration. We measured an increase in bacterial biomass, a decrease in DOC and bacterial respiration as CO2 production and O-2 consumption over 450 h. These measurements were used to calculate bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). Bacterial degradation of DOC increased with increasing exposure to simulated sunlight and availability of phosphorus and no detectable growth occurred on DOC that was not pre-exposed to simulated sunlight. The outcome of photochemical degradation of DOC changed with increasing availability of phosphorus, resulting in an increase in BGE from about 5% to 30%. Thus, the availability of phosphorus has major implications for the quantitative transfer of carbon in microbial food webs.

Two distinct spectral slope regions ( 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm) within log-transformed absorption spectra were used to compare DOM from contrasting water types, ranging from wetlands (Great Dismal Swamp and Suwannee River) to photobleached oceanic water ( Atlantic Ocean). On the basis of DOM size-fractionation studies ( ultrafiltration and gel filtration chromatography), the slope of the 275-295- nm region and the ratio of these slopes (S-R; 275-295- nm slope : 350-400- nm slope) were related to DOM molecular weight ( MW) and to photochemically induced shifts in MW. Dark aerobic microbial alteration of chromophoric DOM ( CDOM) resulted in spectral slope changes opposite of those caused by photochemistry. Along an axial transect in the Delaware Estuary, large variations in S-R were measured, probably due to mixing, photodegradation, and microbial alteration of CDOM as terrestrially derived DOM transited through the estuary. Further, SR varied by over a factor of 13 between DOM-rich wetland waters and Sargasso Sea surface waters. Currently, there is no consensus on a wavelength range for log-transformed absorption spectra. We propose that the 275-295- nm slope be routinely reported in future DOM studies, as it can be measured with high precision, it facilitates comparison among dissimilar water types including CDOM-rich wetland and CDOM-poor marine waters, and it appears to be a good proxy for DOM MW.

Fluxes of dissolved organic matter in larch forests in the cryolithozone of central Siberia	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in larch biogeocenoses and its export from the drainage basin have been studied in the zone of continuous permafrost. A comparative assessment of DOM input into the soil has been made on slopes of northern and southern exposures (as variants reflecting the current state and warming). The dynamics of DOM export in a creek depending on the increasing depth of the active soil horizon in the drainage area have been revealed. It is concluded that an increase in the depth of the seasonally thawing layer induced by global warming will not have any significant effect on the amount of annual DOM export. Reduction of DOM export may be expected upon a decrease in litter stocks under the effect of their mineralization and forest fires.																	1067-4136					MAY	2008	39	3					151	159		10.1134/S1067413608030016						WOS:000255747600001

At 307 sites sampled in various coastal marine environments, the ratio between CDOM and the total absorption coefficient ([a(CDOM/)a(t)]) at 412 nm was found to vary over a wide range, from 0.20 to 0.95. An empirical algorithm was developed to retrieve [a(CDOM)/a(t)](412) from satellite remote sensing reflectance. The absolute uncertainty on the [a(CDOM)/a(t)] retrieval was 0.14. As exemplified with the data from the Baltic and North Seas, the algorithm provides a means to distinguish the contribution of CDOM to the absorption coefficient of colored detrital material (i.e., CDM = CDOM + nonalgal particles) at the regional scale. The implications of the variability in the magnitude and spectral shape of [a(CDOM)/a(t)] for the assessment of depth-integrated production of any photoproducts involving CDOM photolysis are discussed in details. We applied the algorithm to a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) image of the Southeastern Beaufort Sea where terrestrial inputs are abundant. The spatial variability in the [a(CDOM)/a(t)] reaches as much as threefold over the continental shelf and beyond. These results clearly show that it is necessary to account for the spatial variability of [a(CDOM)/a(t)] when quantifying CDOM-related photochemical processes in the ocean.																	0148-0227					APR 24	2008	113	C4							C04027	10.1029/2007JC004436						WOS:000255460700002

Bioavailable Cu species were operationally defined as those species that were able to induce gene expression in a Cu-specific Pseudomonas fluorescens biosensor. Biosensor measurements were backed by analysis of total Cu in soil and of total Cu and free CU2+ ion activity in solution. Cu bioavailability relative to the total Cu concentration increased dramatically with increasing Cu loading of manure and with increasing manure amendment to soil. In both cases, the immediate increase in bioavailability could be explained in part by increased Cu concentration in solution and in part by an increased bioavailability of dissolved Cu species. In contrast to Cu bioavailability, Cu2+ ion activity decreased progressively with increasing manure loading. Cu bioavailability declined rapidly during the weeks after manure amendment concomitant with a marked slow-down of C mineralization indicating a shift from initially bioavailable Cu-dissolved organic matter (Cu-DOM) complexes to nonavailable Cu-DOM complexes over time. Our data do not support the conventional view of metal bioavailability being primarily related to the free metal ion activity and strongly suggest differential bioavailability of Cu-DOM complexes in manure-amended soils.

Tanya; Haettenschwiler, Stephan			Elevated atmospheric CO(2) fuels leaching of old dissolved organic matter at the alpine treeline	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM), the mobile form of soil organic matter (SOM), plays an important role in soil C cycling and in nutrient transport. We investigated the effects of 5 years of CO(2) enrichment (370 versus 570 mu mol CO(2) mol(-1)) on DOM dynamics at the alpine treeline, including the analysis of fast-cycling components such as low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) biodegradability, and the decomposition of (14)C-labeled oxalate. Concentrations of DOC in canopy throughfall were 20% higher at elevated CO(2), probably driven by higher carbohydrate concentrations in leaves. In the organic soil layer, 5 years of CO(2) enrichment increased water-extractable organic C by 17% and soil solution DOC at 5 cm depth by 20%. The (13)C tracing of recently assimilated CO(2) revealed that the input of recent plant-derived C (< 15% of total DOC) was smaller than the CO(2)-induced increase in DOC. This strongly suggests that CO(2) enrichment enhanced the mobilization of native DOC, which is supported by significant increases in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). We mainly attribute these increases to a stimulated microbial activity as indicated by higher basal and soil respiration rates (+27%). The (14)C-labeled oxalate was more rapidly mineralized from high CO(2) soils. The concentrations of LMWOAs, but also those of "hydrophilic'' DOC and biodegradable DOC (6% of total DOC), were, however, not affected by elevated CO(2), suggesting that production and consumption of "labile'' DOC were in balance. In summary, our data suggest that 5 years of CO(2) enrichment speeded up the cycling of "labile'' DOM and SOM in a late successional treeline ecosystem and increased the mobilization of older DOM through a stimulated microbial activity. Such a "priming effect'' implies that elevated CO(2) can accelerate the turnover of native SOM, and thus, it may induce increasing losses of old C from thick organic layers.																	0886-6236					APR 12	2008	22	2							GB2004	10.1029/2007GB003026						WOS:000255075700003

Tropical tree species composition affects the oxidation of dissolved organic matter from litter	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Plant species effects on soil nutrient availability are relatively well documented, but the effects of species differences in litter chemistry on soil carbon cycling are less well understood, especially in the species-rich tropics. In many wet tropical forest ecosystems, leaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the litter layer accounts for a significant proportion of litter mass loss during decomposition. Here we investigated how tree species differences in soluble dissolved organic C (DOC) and nutrients affected soil CO(2) fluxes in laboratory incubations. We leached DOM from freshly fallen litter of six canopy tree species collected from a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica and measured C-mineralization. We found significant differences in litter solubility and nutrient availability. Following DOM additions to soil, rates of heterotrophic respiration varied by as much as an order of magnitude between species, and overall differences in total soil CO(2) efflux varied by more than four-fold. Variation in the carbon: phosphorus ratio accounted for 51% of the variation in total CO(2) flux between species. These results suggest that tropical tree species composition may influence soil C storage and mineralization via inter-specific variation in plant litter chemistry.																	0168-2563					APR	2008	88	2					127	138		10.1007/s10533-008-9200-0						WOS:000256264000003

Fluorescence characteristics and biodegradability of dissolved organic matter in forest and wetland soils from coastal temperate watersheds in southeast Alaska	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Understanding how the concentration and chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies in soils is critical because DOM influences an array of biological, chemical, and physical processes. We used PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy, specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate the chemical quality of DOM in soil water collected from 25 cm piezometers in four different wetland and forest soils: bog, forested wetland, fen and upland forest. There were significant differences in soil solution concentrations of dissolved organic C, N, and P, DOC:DON ratios, SUVA(254) and BDOC among the four soil types. Throughout the sampling period, average DOC concentrations in the four soil types ranged from 9-32 mg C l(-1) and between 23-42% of the DOC was biodegradable. Seasonal patterns in dissolved nutrient concentrations and BDOC were observed in the three wetland types suggesting strong biotic controls over DOM concentrations in wetland soils. PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy showed that protein-like fluorescence was positively correlated (r(2) = 0.82; P < 0.001) with BDOC for all soil types taken together. This finding indicates that PARAFAC modeling may substantially improve the ability to predict BDOC in natural environments. Coincident measurements of DOM concentrations, BDOC and PARAFAC modeling confirmed that the four soil types contain DOM with distinct chemical properties and have unique fluorescent fingerprints. DOM inputs to streams from the four soil types therefore have the potential to alter stream biogeochemical processes differently by influencing temporal patterns in stream heterotrophic productivity.																	0168-2563					APR	2008	88	2					169	184		10.1007/s10533-008-9203-x						WOS:000256264000006

However, obtaining complete recoveries implies the rinsing of the reverse osmosis system with a solution of dilute NaOH and combining the rinse solution and the DOM concentrate. Because of the potential chemical alterations that can affect the integrity of the organic pool leached from the RO system at high pHs, this approach is not compatible with studies based on the molecular-level analysis of DOM. The potential for elemental, isotopic, and chemical fractionation was thus evaluated on a series of freshwater DOM samples concentrated in the field with a portable RO system when the concentrate and the rinse solution are not combined. DOC recoveries in the concentrate varied between 81.6 and 88.8%, and total balance calculations showed total recoveries of dissolved and particulate organic carbon ranging between 96.4 and 106.9%. Despite similar delta C-13 signatures, differences in N content and FTIR-based chemical composition between the concentrate and the rinse DOM solutions suggest some degree of chemical fractionation.

J	Liang, S; Zhao, Y; Liu, C; Song, L				Liang, Shuang; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Cui; Song, Lianfa			Effect of solution chemistry on the fouling potential of dissolved organic matter in membrane bioreactor systems	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a potent foulant in membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems has attracted great attention in recent years. This paper attempts to elucidate the effect of solution chemistry (i.e. solution pH, ionic strength, and calcium concentration) on the fouling potential of DOM with different characteristics. Results of microfiltration experiments showed that the fouling potential of DOM having higher hydrophobic content increased more markedly at low pH due to the reduced ionization of carboxylic, and phenolic functional groups of aquatic humic substances. In contrast, the fouling potential of hydrophilic DOM components and the molecular size of DOM appeared to be less affected by solution pH. The more compact molecular configuration of DOM at high ionic strength contributed to form a denser fouling layer, and limited the amount of foulants retained by the membranes on the other hand. DOM fouling potential greatly increased with increasing calcium concentration. The magnitude of the increase, however, was independent of the hydrophobicity of DOM, suggesting strong interactions exist between calcium ions and hydrophilic DOM components. Moreover, it was observed that the main mechanism governing the effect of calcium ions on the molecular size of DOM transited from charge shielding to complex formation as calcium concentration increased.

Two peaks, peak 2 (retention time (RT) = 32 min) and peak 3 (RT = 35 min), were detected in the algal DOM released from Microcystis aeruginosa during cultivation and biodegradation by gel chromatography with a fluorescence detector (Ex = 340 nm, Em = 435 nm). As these peaks correspond with the peaks detected in the surface water of Lake Biwa, one can conclude that the algal DOM released from Microcystis aeruginosa during cultivation and biodegradation makes a considerable contribution to the refractory organic matter in Lake Biwa. Three fluorescence maxima were observed in the cultivation of Microcystis aeruginosa: a fulvic-like fluorescence peak (peak A) with Ex/Em values of 320/430 nm, a protein-like fluorescence peak (peak Q with Ex/Em values of 280/360 nm, and another peak with Ex/Em values of 240/370 nm. The fluorescence material of peak C has a larger MW than that of peak A. The algal-derived DOM from Microcystis aeruginosa has similar fluorescence to fulvic acid of soil origin but exhibits mainly hydrophilic characteristics. In the biodegradation of Microcystis aeruginosa, a fulvic-like fluorescence peak (peak B) with Ex/Em values of 250/440 nm and a peak with Ex/Em values of 320/380 nm were observed.																	0910-6340					MAR	2008	24	3					389	394		10.2116/analsci.24.389						WOS:000254220500014	18332548

The elemental composition of about 300 molecules was identified. Those in the HPO fraction (C-14 age of 5100 year) are very similar to much younger freshwater fulvic acids, but less aromatic and more oxygenated molecules are more frequent This trend continues toward the HPI fraction and may indicate biotic and abiotic aging processes that this material experienced since its primary production thousands of years ago. In the HPI fraction series of nitrogenous molecules containing one, two, or three nitrogens were identified by FTICR-MS. Product ion spectra of the nitrogenous molecules suggest that the nitrogen atoms in these molecules are included in the (alicyclic) backbone of these molecules, possibly in reduced form. These mass spectrometric data suggest that a large set of stable fulvic acids is ubiquitous in all aquatic compartments. Although sources may differ, their actual composition and structure appears to be quite similar and largely independent from their source, because they are the remainder of intensive oxidative degradation processes.

However, relationship between DOM conformation and its binding properties remains unclear. We designed a multibag equilibration system (MBES) to investigate the variation of carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (K(DOC)) of pyrene at different DOM concentrations based on an identical free solute concentration at different pHs and in the presence of Al ions. In addition, we studied the conformation of DOM under different conditions via atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential measurements. Zeta potential measurements indicated that intra- and intermolecular interaction was facilitated at low pH or with the presence of Al ions, and a more organized molecular aggregate (such as a micelle-like structure) could form, thus, enhancing KDOC. As DOM concentration increased, DOM molecular aggregation was promoted in a way reducing KDOC. This research is a first attempt to correlate DOM conformation with K(DOC). Aggregation of DOM molecules resulting from increased zeta potential (less negative) generally led to an increased K(DOC). Further study in this area will provide valuable information on HOC-DOM interactions, thus, leading to more accurate predictions of KDOC.

Variable toxicity of ionic liquid-forming chemicals to Lemna minor and the influence of dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Ionic liquids (ILs) are nonvolatile organic salts that remain liquid over a wide range of temperatures. Ionic liquids are promoted as environmentally friendly alternatives to the volatile organic solvents that are currently in widespread industrial usage. Although ILs are unlikely to contribute to air pollution, their potential effects on aquatic ecosystems are largely unknown. Furthermore. information is lacking on how ILs will interact with common features of aquatic environments, such as dissolved organic matter (DOM). We assessed the effect of five IL-forming chemicals on the growth of duckweed, Lemna minor, a common aquatic vascular plant. In general, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chemicals with longer alkyl chains were more toxic to L. minor than those with short alkyl chain lengths. The concentration that produced a 50% reduction (the EC50) in root growth was 8.56 ppm when a butyl chain was present but was 0.25 ppm (i.e., much more toxic) when an octyl chain was substituted. Butyl-substituted 3-methylpyridinium (root growth EC50 of 7.49 ppm) and 3-methylimidazolium cations had similar toxicity, whereas a tetrabutyl ammonium cation was considerably less toxic (root growth EC50 of 32.71 ppm). When we tested whether DOM reduced the toxicity of these cations, we saw no effect of a low-molecular-weight organic acid or commercial humic matter. In contrast, natural DOM reduced the toxicity of imidazolium. but only at low concentrations. Design and use of ILs and other new chemicals should incorporate not only standard toxicity tests but also information on how such chemicals will interact with other components of aquatic ecosystems.																	0730-7268					MAR	2008	27	3					676	681		10.1897/06-540.1						WOS:000253374500023	17967067

The aims of the study were to define the onset of eutrophication in the lake and to track its course. An attempt was also made to reconstruct lake conditions before the intensive nutrient loading began. Fossil pigment analysis indicated that the eutrophication of the lake started in the 1960s and accelerated in the 1970s. Sedimentary pigments also indicate a continuing tendency of the lake ecosystem towards eutrophy in the 1980s and 1990s. However, changes in the molecular size structure of pore-water dissolved organic matter indicated that the contribution of autochthonous matter to the organic pool of the lake ecosystem had already started to increase around the end of the 1930s. We conclude that this rise was generated by a coincidence of several anthropogenic and natural factors. The pore-water data also show that a slight relative reduction in the autochthonous organic matter took place in the 1990s. A discordance in the paleodata obtained for the beginning of the 20th century complicates clear conclusions about earlier conditions in the lake. On the one hand, the qualitative characteristics of pore-water dissolved organic matter and the low concentration of chlorophyll a indicate that the phytoplankton biomass was low in Lake Peipsi during that period. On the other hand, the concentrations of marker pigments of specific phytoplankton groups are high, comparable with the values in the recent sediments. Possible reasons for the high levels of these pigments in the early 1900s sediments, such as a shift in the preservation conditions of organic substances and their transport from the lake's catchment, are discussed.

Tracing of dissolved organic matter from the SEPETIBA Bay (Brazil) by PARAFAC analysis of total luminescence matrices	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Fluorescent excitation-emission matrices (FEEM) of the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) are widely used for DOM characterization and tracing. In this work, a set of FEEM from sampling campaigns in the Sepetiba Bay (Brazil) was decomposed into independent components using the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) algorithm. Four independent components were extracted describing the total fluorescence of the FDOM. The well described peaks A, C, M, B and T were found, and a new peak, A ', linked to the C peak, was detected. Relative contribution of each of four components to the total fluorescence confirms that the coastal water has DOM of terrestrial origin, except for the 275Ex/400-500Em range (nm), which primarily occurs in marine waters.

Boron adsorption by soils as affected by dissolved organic matter from treated sewage effluent	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Although it is well known that treated sewage effluent enhances trace elements and nutrient solubility in soil solution through their complexation with dissolved organic matter (DOM), no information is available yet for B. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of DOM with B and native soil organic matter (OM) on B adsorption by soils. Batch equilibrium studies were conducted to measure the B adsorption by DOM (pH 7.7) that was selected from a municipal sewage plant. Effluent DOM was found to have a low affinity for the soils and its application resulted in a release of native soil OM into solution. The OM release was enhanced significantly by an increase in soil mass/solution volume ratio and effluent DOM concentration, The B adsorption capacity of DOM (294-333 mg kg(-1)) was less than that found for different humic acids (583-2235.6 mg kg(-1)). Nevertheless, the presence of DOM reduced the free-B concentration in solution due to formation of B-DOM complexes. As the total DOM concentration increased, the slope of the isotherms for B adsorption by soil decreased. All the B adsorption isotherms obtained for the different DOM concentrations merged into one isotherm, however, when free-B solution concentration was taken into consideration. The results suggest that the B-DOM complex did not interact with the soil.																	0361-5995					MAR-APR	2008	72	2					492	499		10.2136/sssaj2007.0086						WOS:000254060200023

We studied the in situ partitioning of Hg in the organic top layer (mor) of podsols at two boreal forest sites differing in Hg deposition and climatic regime (S. and N. Sweden, with pollution declining to the north). Soil solution leaching from the mor layer was repeatedly sampled using zero-tension lysimeters over 2 years, partly in parallel with tension lysimeters. Concentrations of Hg and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher while pH was lower at the southern site (means +/- SD: Hg=44 +/- 15 ng L-1, DOC=63.0 +/- 31.3 mg L-1, pH=4.05 +/- 0.53) than at the northern site (Hg=22 +/- 6 ng L-1, DOC=41.8 +/- 12.1 mg L-1, pH=4.28 +/- 0.43). There was a positive correlation over time between dissolved Hg and DOC at both sites, even though the DOC concentration peaked during autumn at both sites, while the Hg concentration remained more constant. This correlation is consistent with the expected strong association of Hg with organic matter and supports the use of Hg/C ratios in assessments of Hg mobility. In the solid phase of the overlying O-f layer, both Hg concentrations and Hg/C ratios were higher at the southern site (means +/- SD: 0.34 +/- 0.06 mu g g(-1) dw and 0.76 +/- 0.14 mu g g(-1) C, respectively) than at the northern site (0.31 +/- 0.05 mu g g(-1) dw and 0.70 +/- 0.12 mu g g(-1) C, respectively). However, concentrations in the solid phase differed less than might be expected from the difference in current atmospheric input, suggesting that the fraction of natural Hg is still substantial. At both sites, Hg/C ratios in the upper half of the mor layer were only about two thirds of those in the lower half, suggesting that the recent decrease in anthropogenic Hg deposition onto the soil is offset by a natural downward enrichment of Hg due to soil decomposition or other processes. Most interestingly, comparison with soil leachate showed that the average Hg/C ratios in the dissolved phase of the mor layers at both sites did not differ from the average Hg/C ratios in the overlying solid organic matter. These results indicate a simple mobilisation with negligible fractionation, despite differences in Hg deposition patterns, soil chemistry and climatic regimes. Such a straight-forward linkage between Hg and organic matter greatly facilitates the parameterisation of watershed models for assessing the biogeochemical fate, toxic effect and critical level of atmospheric Hg input to forest soils.

Removal of dissolved organic matter by granular-activated carbon adsorption as a pretreatment to reverse osmosis of membrane bioreactor effluents	WATER RESEARCH												The adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on granular-activated carbon (GAC) as a pretreatment to reverse osmosis (RO) desalination of membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluents was studied in lab-and pilot-scale columns. The pattern and efficiency of DOM adsorption and fate of the hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPI) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions were characterized, as well as their impact on organic fouling of the RO membranes. Relatively low DOM adsorption capacity and low intensity of adsorption were observed in batch studies. Continuous adsorption experiments performed within a range of hydraulic velocities of 0.9-12 m/h depicted permissible values within the mass transfer zone up to 1.6 m/h. The breakthrough curves within this range displayed a non-adsorbable fraction of 24 +/- 6% and a biodegradable fraction of 49 +/- 12%. Interestingly, the adsorbable fraction remained almost constant (similar to 30%) in the entire hydraulic range studied. Comparative analysis by HPO interaction chromatography showed a steady removal (63-66%) of the HPO fraction. SUVA index and Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated that DOM changes during the adsorption phase were mainly due to elution of the more HPI components. GAC pretreatment in pilot-scale columns resulted in 80-90% DOM removal from MBR effluents, which in turn stabilized membrane permeability and increased permeate quality. FTIR analysis indicated that the residual DOM present in the RO permeate, regardless of the pretreatment, was mainly of HPI character (e.g., low-molecular-weight humics linked to polysaccharides and proteins). The DOM removed by GAC pretreatment is composed mainly of HPO and biodegradable components, which constitutes the fraction primarily causing organic fouling. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Low salinity Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) was observed widely in the shelf region and was considered to be the main origin of CDOM, resulting in a strong relationship between salinity and a(g)(lambda). Error of satellite a(g)(lambda) estimated by the present ocean color algorithm could be corrected by satellite-retrieved chlorophyll data. Satellite-retrieved salinity could be predicted with about +/- 1.0 accuracy from satellite a(g)(lambda) and the relation between salinity and a(g)(lambda).

In this short review, we present recent evidence that this view is invalid. The stability of DOM from forest floor horizons, peats, and topsoils against microbial degradation increases with advanced decomposition of the parent organic matter (OM). Aromatic compounds, deriving from lignin, likely are the most stable components of DOM while plant-derived carbohydrates seem easily degradable. Carbohydrates and N-rich compounds of microbial origin produced during the degradation of DOM can be relatively stable. Such components contribute much to DOM in the mineral subsoil. Sorption of DOM to soil minerals and (co-)precipitation with Al (and probably also with Fe), especially of the inherently stable aromatic moieties, result in distinct stabilization. In laboratory incubation experiments, the mean residence time of DOM from the Oa horizon of a Haplic Podzol increased from <30 y in solution to >90 y after sorption to a subsoil. We combined DOM fluxes and mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to minerals and a subsoil horizon, and (co-) precipitated with Al to estimate the potential contribution of DOM to total C in the mineral soil of a Haplic Podzol in Germany. The contribution of roots to DOM was not considered because of lack of data. The DOM-derived soil C ranges from 20 to 55 Mg ha(-1) in the mineral soil, which represents 19%-50% of the total soil C. The variation of the estimate reflects the variation in mineralization rate constants obtained for sorbed and (co-) precipitated DOM. Nevertheless, the estimates indicate that DOM contributes significantly to the accumulation of stable OM in soil. A more precise estimation of DOM-derived C in soils requires mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to all relevant minerals or (co-)precipitated with Fe. Additionally, we need information on the contribution of sorption to distinct minerals as well as of (co-)precipitation with Al and Fe to DOM retention.

Effects of photochemical transformations of dissolved organic matter on bacterial metabolism and diversity in three contrasting coastal sites in the Northwestern Mediterranean sea during summer	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The effects of phototransformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on bacterial growth, production, respiration, growth efficiency, and diversity were investigated during summer in two lagoons and one oligotrophic coastal water samples from the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, differing widely in DOM and chromophoric DOM concentrations. Exposure of 0.2-mu m filtered waters to full sun radiation for 1 d resulted in small changes in optical properties and concentrations of DOM, and no changes in nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate concentrations. After exposure to sunlight or dark (control) treatments, the water samples were inoculated with the original bacterial community. Phototransformation of DOM had contrasting effects on bacterial production and respiration, depending on the water's origin, resulting in an increase of bacterial growth efficiency for the oligotrophic coastal water sample (120%) and a decrease for the lagoon waters (20 to 40%) relative to that observed in dark treatments. We also observed that bacterial growth on DOM irradiated by full sun resulted in changes in community structure of total and metabolically active bacterial cells for the three locations studied when compared to the bacteria growing on un-irradiated DOM, and that changes were mainly caused by phototransformation of DOM by UV radiation for the eutrophic lagoon and the oligotrophic coastal water and by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for the mesoeutrophic lagoon. These initial results indicate that phototransformation of DOM significantly alters both bacterial metabolism and community structure in surface water for a variety of coastal ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate a more detailed appreciation of potential temporal and spatial variations of the effects measured.

The modulating role of dissolved organic matter on spatial patterns of microbial metabolism in Lake Erie sediments	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												To evaluate the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on microbial community metabolism, we established extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) profiles of sediment samples collected from littoral and profundal regions of the western, central, and eastern basins of Lake Erie. Lake Erie is spatially structured such that the central and western basins receive relatively major inputs of allochthonous DOM in comparison to the eastern basin. Overall, spatial patterns of EEA and SIR profiles suggest both greater metabolic diversity and activity in the littoral regions of the central and western basins. In contrast, the eastern basin demonstrated much less structuring between littoral and profundal areas. To evaluate whether the observed spatial patterns are the result of microbial community adaptations to local DOM availability, we performed three experimental treatments by inoculating sediment samples with polyvinylpyrrolidone, which sequesters large polyphenols, or with either vanillin or catechol, two small phenolic compounds. Our results revealed that esterase and glycosidase EEA from the eastern basin were induced by small phenolics and inhibited by large polyphenols. In contrast, the addition of small phenolics decreased esterase and glycosidase activities from the central basin, while polyphenols had a negligible effect. These results suggest that the source and composition of DOM play a significant role in the local adaptation of microbial communities, determining large-scale spatial patterns of microbial functional diversity in Lake Erie sediments.																	0095-3628					FEB	2008	55	2					358	368		10.1007/s00248-007-9281-7						WOS:000252769500018	17607503

Adsorption of polychlorinated biphenyls to activated carbon: Equilibrium isotherms and a preliminary assessment of the effect of dissolved organic matter and biofilm loadings	WATER RESEARCH												Sequestration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by activated carbon (AC) has been proposed as a remediation strategy for PCB-contaminated sediments. However, published PCB-AC adsorption isotherm data are sparse and, while sediment-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) and biofilms are likely to be present in sediments, the impacts of these loadings have not been quantified. Batch laboratory experiments were undertaken to obtain equilibrium adsorption capacities, q(e), for 9 PCBs on virgin AC, DOM-loaded AC, and biofilm-covered AC. Isotherm data fit the Freundlich isotherm equation (average R-2 = 0.94, n = 27) over the range of aqueous concentrations studied (similar to 0.1-1000 ng/L). Planarity effects were evident at low aqueous concentrations only (0.1-10 ng/L), where qe of three PCBs of similar hydrophobicity decreased with an increasing number of ortho-chlorines, indicating steric hindrances attenuated adsorption. The values of qe for DOM- and biofilm-loaded ACs were approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those on virgin AC when normalized by the available AC surface area, indicating that PCB adsorption likely occurred on specific regions of the AC structure. Nevertheless, virgin and loaded ACs used in this study had sufficiently high PCB adsorption capacities to warrant further study as an in-situ remediation alternative for PCB-contaminated sediments.

Understanding the seasonal changes in DOM composition and their reactivity in DBP formation could lead to a better treatment of drinking water and a more consistent water quality. DOM from the East-Lake, a reservoir in the south-China, was fractionated and characterized by XAD resin adsorption (RA) and ultrafiltration (UF) techniques during different seasons within a year. The properties of chemical fractions (isolated by RA) appeared more stable than those of physical fractions (separated by UF) throughout the sampling period. The relative contribution of each chemical fraction to the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV254 absorbance and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) remained relatively constant across the sampling period. However, the physical (molecular weight) fractions of the DOM exhibited large seasonal changes in UV254 and THMFP. Compared to the parameter of DOC, the THMFP and specific THMFP (STHMFP) of either chemical or physical fractions were more variable. In terms of DOC concentration, the hydrophobic acids (HoA) and hydrophilic matter (HiM) dominated in the DOM in most of the seasons; while the components with molecular weight of 10-30 kDa and less than I kDa were the predominant physical fractions.

Direct H-1 NMR spectroscopy of dissolved organic matter in natural waters	ANALYST												Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy arguably provides the greatest insight into the overall chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, in a standard 5 mm NMR probe, a sample of sea water at natural abundance only contains ca. 500-600 ng of organic matter, distributed among the heterogeneous components of DOM. Additionally, the intensity of the water signal, which may be many orders of magnitude greater than the signals from DOM, makes the detection and analysis of DOM at natural abundance extremely demanding. Here, we demonstrate, that although challenging, the application of an improved water suppression technique allows NMR spectra of DOM to be obtained directly (i.e without pre-concentration) for major bodies of water, including rivers, lakes and the ocean. The technique described here provides a compositional overview of an intact sample, permitting researchers to investigate and assess the impact of concentration, isolation and extraction procedures that are employed routinely. Also the technique permits NMR to be performed on 'precious' samples for which traditional isolations are not possible, for example, water from ice cores and pore water, which are key in hydrology and for paleoclimatic reconstruction.																	0003-2654						2008	133	2					263	269		10.1039/b713457f						WOS:000252757000018	18227951

We have hypothesised that soil quality have substantial influence on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations. Based oil soils of Soil Monitoring System of Hungary, relationship between soil parameters and DOC and DON were carried out by correlation and regression analysis. DOC concentration of soils was determined to the greatest extent by soil organic matter (r = 0.558**). The DOC content and two parameters (y(1) and CaCO3 content), that corresponding with soil pH. are in a rather strong correlation (r = 0.204* and r = 0.205*). There also has been a strong relationship between DOC and the different N forms (nitrate, ammonium and total N). For DON. almost the same correlation relationships have been found than for DOC, It depends oil - less extent than DOC - humus content (r = 0.458**), on soil acidity parameters (pH, CaCO3; r = 0.225** and r = 0.391**) and on N forms of soil. of all of them, the strongest correlation was with the total N content.

Effect of environmental forcing on the fate of nutrients, dissolved organic matter and heavy metals released by a coastal wastewater pipeline	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Discharges of nutrients, urea, dissolved organic matter and heavy metals by a sewage underwater pipeline are analysed in comparison to environmental conditions in a shallow coastal zone. Variable thermo-haline stratifications of the water column and currents in upper (2.62-34.97 cm s(-1)) and deeper (0.83-10.91 cm s(-1)) layers drive vertical diffusion and lateral transport of wastewaters. Loads of reactive phosphorus (0.13 tons d(-1)) and ammonium (1.62tonsd(-1)) by the pipeline are not negligible compared to the major river loads in the gulf. High concentrations of urea (<= 11.51 mu mol N dm(-3)) were found in the area of wastewater release. Ammonium uptake (6.14-534 nmol N dm(-3) h(-1)) strongly exceeded nitrate uptake (0.19-138 nmol N dm(-3) h(-1)), indicating that discharges of ammonium by the pipeline are actively assimilated by plankton community even at low levels of light. Distribution of Zn (<= 27.7ppb), Cu (<= 25.6ppb), Cd (<= 0.80ppb) and Pb (<= 13.5ppb) in the water column and the measurement of their complex-forming capacity in seawater did not indicate a persistent perturbation of the pelagic environment due to heavy metals.				adami, gianpiero/A-8746-2011; Cozzi, stefano/G-1511-2011; CNR, Ismar/P-1247-2014; 	adami, gianpiero/0000-0002-1608-2050; CNR, Ismar/0000-0001-5351-1486; COZZI, STEFANO/0000-0003-0116-742X												0275-7540						2008	24	2					87	107		10.1080/02757540801919354						WOS:000255157800001

The water quality of the three feed waters collected at various water table depths was characterized by XAD-8/-4 resin adsorption, high performance size exclusion chromatography with ultraviolet and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) detections, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine NOM fractionation, molecular weight, and NOM functional groups, respectively. Systematic studies were conducted to identify potential NOM foulants in ground water for nanofiltration (NF) membrane fouling. The results show that the hydrophobic fraction of NOM in all of the samples was significantly high (71-93%) compared to the hydrophilic (1.7-22.6%) and transphilic (5.3-6.6%) fractions. However, insignificant flux-decline (less than 5%) was observed for the highest DOC (36.9 mg l(-1)) and hydrophobic NOM (93%) containing groundwater compared to the other lesser DOC and hydrophobic NOM containing ground waters. This is presumably due to either higher fractions of hydrophilic and transphilic NOM or inorganic interactions that may be major foulants. Based on FTIR, aromatic foulants were observed at 1662 cm(-1) (CO-NH2 or CO conjugated with aromatic rings) for the fouled NF membrane with the relatively low DOC source waters. The contact angle of the clean membrane (52 degrees) decreased with fouling up to 42-47 degrees for fouled membranes with the various samples. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of dissolved organic matter on the solubility of heavy metals in sewage-sludge-amended soils	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Sewage-sludge-amended soils generally contain elevated levels of organic matter and heavy metals compared to control soils. Because organic matter is known to complex with heavy metals, the solubility behavior of the organic matter in such soils may exert a significant influence on the solubility of the metals. Little is known about such a process. Using batch experiments in which the solubility of organic matter in a heavily sludge-amended soil was artificially manipulated, we show that the solubilities of the heavy metals copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) show a strong positive relationship to the solubility of organic matter, particularly at high pH. The results suggest that under field conditions, spatiotemporal variations in the solid-solution partitioning of organic matter may have a bearing on the environmental significance (mobility and bioavailability) of these heavy metals.

Disinfection by-product formation of water having high bromide content after separate ion exchange and carbon adsorption and subsequent chlorination was compared. The ion exchange resin showed superior dissolved organic carbon (DOC) uptake, although SUVA reduction by the two sorbents was comparable. The concentrations of total trihalomethanes (THM4) and the sum of six haloacetic acids (HAA6) were reduced by both sorbents, although the resin was capable of meeting drinking water regulations at much lower doses. The effect of ion exchange and carbon adsorption on THM4 reactivity (yield) was markedly different, and the results demonstrate that ion exchange removes reactive DOM species that GAC does not. Bromine incorporation factor (BIF) values for both sorbents increased initially and were similar at low dosages; however, as dosage increased further the BIF after resin treatment decreased rapidly and remained significantly lower than the BIF after GAC treatment.

Pb uptake by the freshwater alga Chlorella kesslerii in the presence of dissolved organic matter of variable composition	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of ill-defined components, which makes the quantitative understanding of DOM functions in aquatic systems a challenging task. The traditional approach for studying such complex mixtures involves their separation into groups of different components, while assuming minimal or no alteration of their properties. By mixing the pre-isolated and well-characterised individual fractions of the DOM, including humic, fulvic and alginic acids, we have demonstrated that the free Pb ion concentrations and the adsorbed Pb plus Pb internalised by the alga Chlorella kesslerii in the presence of DOM samples of different compositions can be predicted on the basis of the experiments performed in the presence of the individual DOM fractions. An additivity model assuming that the properties of the mixture can be considered as the sum of the properties of the individual components captured the Pb speciation and adsorption behaviour in the presence of DOM of variable compositions. Similarly to the results with the individual DOM fractions, internalised Pb concentrations in the presence of the reconstituted DOM were greater than that predicted by the corresponding free lead ion concentration. An improved fit between experimental observations and the model predictions of adsorbed plus internalised Pb in the presence of DOM of different compositions was observed by assuming that each individual component adsorbed by the algae gave access to additional binding sites for Pb. Furthermore, the contribution of the Pb-DOM complex to total cellular Pb was dominated by the humic and fulvic acids, whereas the contribution of alginate was minimal.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacterial growth in floodplains of the Danube River under varying hydrological connectivity	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Inorganic nutrients, distribution of low and high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (DOM), bulk DOM constituents, carbohydrate contents and a fluorescence index of DOM, along with bacterial secondary production (BSP), were determined in a large river floodplain system. The aim was to elucidate the significance of DOM in relation to hydrological conditions. Two floodplain segments with varying degree of connection to the main channel (and for some parameters also the main channel) of the Danube River downstream of Vienna (Austria) were investigated during two hydrologically dynamic periods. In most cases, inorganic nutrients were significantly Coupled to hydrology, but bulk dissolved organic nutrient species in two DOM size fractions were poorly correlated with changing connectivity with the main river. A more specific investigation of DOM properties (fluorescence index based on fulvic acids, carbohydrate content of dissolved organic carbon) revealed good correlation with hydrology, thus mirroring more directly the effect of changing floodplain connectivity and emphasising the importance of local (autochthonous) carbon sources at lower connectivity. BSP, measured during one of the investigated periods, was highly variable, with low values at high discharge and a significant positive dependency on increasing autochthonous DOM-sources indicated by higher fluorescence indices. Hydrological connectivity between the main river and its floodplains appears to be a crucial driving force influencing the quantity but in particular the quality of DOM as well as related microbial processes.

Five types of charcoal and a commercial granular activated carbon (GAC) were used to remove DOM eluted from rice-straw in an adsorption test. The adsorption rate model was considered as the adsorption process in the early steps which showed significant adsorption changes. The results of the adsorption test indicated that the DOM adsorption rate and volume treated by charcoals carbonized at high temperature (group-2) showed significantly higher levels than those of charcoals carbonized at low temperature (group-1). Although group-2 adsorbed less DOM than GAC after 6 hours, the adsorption rate and adsorbed volume of group-2 were greater than those of GAC under 6 hours. The results of the evaluation by the adsorption rate model showed that the calculated value agreed well with the measurements obtained from the adsorption test. It was suggested that DOM could move to the adsorption surface of group-2 more rapidly than that of the GAC in the early adsorption process. In the latter process the volume of DOM adsorption from sample water treated by group-2 was exceeded by that of the GAC which has a large specific surface area. The DOM adsorption processes depended on the specific surface area of charcoals/GAC as well as the DOM transfer rate and desorption.																	0021-3551					JAN	2008	42	1					49	56								WOS:000254945000007

Colored dissolved organic matter in coastal waters influenced by the Atchafalaya River, USA: effects of an algal bloom	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical properties were studied in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal waters influenced by the Atchafalaya River in July 2005 during a period of low river discharge using both field and satellite ocean color data. Although a general conservative CDOM absorption salinity relationship between the riverine and oceanic end members were observed, deviations in surface CDOM absorption from this relationship (CDOM loss) and average higher spectral slope S of the log-linearized absorption spectra in comparison to bottom waters suggested photodegradation of surface CDOM. Excess CDOM absorption in bottom waters at many stations were associated with low oxygen or hypoxic conditions suggesting a potential CDOM source due to remineralization of organic matter in the bottom waters. At a few stations anomalously high CDOM absorption could be linked to biological production associated with algal blooms. Absorption spectra of a surface sample at one such station deviated from standard exponential form in the 300-400m UV range probably due to the presence of photoprotective pigments. CDOM derived from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) using a regional algorithm provided a synoptic view of surface CDOM variations and the extent of river influences into the northern Gulf of Mexico.																	1931-3195						2008	2								023502	10.1117/1.2838253						WOS:000264046200008

Phosphorus and nitrogen sorption to soils in the presence of poultry litter-derived dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Two environmental aspects associated with land application of poultry litter that have not been comprehensively evaluated are (i) the competition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and P for soil sorption sites, and (ii) the sorption of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) relative to inorganic nitrogen species (e.g., NO3- and NH4+) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The competition between DOM and P for sorption sites has often been assumed to increase the amount of P available for plant growth; however, elevating DOM concentrations may also increase P available for transport to water resources. Batch sorption experiments were conducted to (i) evaluate sod properties governing P sorption to benchmark soils of Southwestern Missouri, (ii) elucidate the impact of poultry litter-derived DOM on P sorption, and (iii) investigate DON retention relative to inorganic N species and DOC. Sods were reacted for 24 h with inorganic P (0-60 mg L-1) in the presence and absence of DOM (145 mg C L-1) using a background electrolyte solution comparable to DOM extracts (I = 10.8 mmol L-1; pH 7.7). Soil P sorption was positively correlated with metal oxide (r(2) = 0.70) and clay content (r(2) = 0.79) and negatively correlated with Bray-1 extractable P(r(2) = 0.79). Poultry litter-derived DOM had no significant negative impact on P sorption. Dissolved organic nitrogen was preferentially removed from solution relative to (NO3- -N + NO2- -N), NH4+-N, and DOC. This research indicates that poultry litter-derived DOM is not likely to enhance inorganic P transport which contradicts the assumption that DOM released from organic wastes increases plant-available P when organic amendments and Fertilizer P are co-applied. Additionally, this work demonstrates the need to further evaluate the fate and transport of DON in agroecosystem soils receiving poultry litter applications.																	1537-2537					JAN-FEB	2008	37	1					154	163		10.2134/jeq2007.0141						WOS:000252625000017	18178888

Elemental analysis showed that carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content decreased with landfill age, while the oxygen content increased. Moreover, the nitrogen content in these isolated fractions followed: HA > Hyl > FA. The results of elemental analysis, FT-IR, and fluorescence EEMs also confirmed that aromatic carbons and portions of aliphatic functional groups were more abundant in leachate samples with increasing landfill age.

The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may complicate the sorption process in soil. The effects of DOM from sewage sludge on TBBPA sorption by three soils were investigated using batch equilibration experiments in the study. DOM was observed to be sorbed on the soils and the isotherms could be fitted by the Langmuir model. The effects of DOM on TBBPA sorption were dependent on the characteristics of soils and the concentrations of DOM present. TBBPA sorption by Henan (HN) soil (sandy loam) and Liaoning (LN) soil (loamy clay) was promoted in the presence of DOM at low concentration (<= 90 mg organic carbon (OC)/L), and the sorption was promoted by HN soil and inhibited by LN soil at DOM added concentration of 180 mg OC/L. TBBPA sorption by Guangxi (GX) soil (silt loam) was always inhibited in the presence of DOM. It was also found that the amount of TBBPA sorbed decreased with the increase in the solution pH value in the absence of DOM. The influencing mechanisms of DOM on the sorption of TBBPA by soils were also discussed.

The DOM was obtained from humus soil (DOMH), rice straw (DOMR), and pig manure (DOMP). The presence of DOM obviously reduced Hg maximum adsorption capacity with up to 40% decreases over the control, being an order of DOMH (250.00 mg/kg) < DOMR (303.03 mg/kg) < DOMP (322.58 mg/kg) < CK (control 416.67 mg/kg) for the XUF and DOMH (270.27 mg/kg) < DOMR (312.50 mg/kg) < DOMP (324.23 mg/kg) < CK (476.11 mg/kg) for the TPUC, respectively. The inhibition of DOM on Hg adsorption was slightly weaker in XUF than in TPUC. Meanwhile, the DOM promoted Hg desorption from the soils. The kinetic models, the Two-constant equation and Elovich equation, were applicable to describe the adsorption and desorption processes of Hg in soils. The speed of Hg adsorption was consistently slowed down by the existence of DOM.																	1001-0742	1878-7320					2008	20	9					1097	1102		10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62155-5						WOS:000259244600012	19143317

Dissolved organic matter and bacterial production and respiration in the sea-surface microlayer of the open Atlantic and the western Mediterranean Sea	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The sea-surface microlayer (SML) is the boundary layer between the ocean and the atmosphere. We measured bacterial production and respiration along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus, inorganic nutrients, and dissolved amino acids in the SML and the underlying water (ULW) of the subtropical Atlantic gyre (SATL) and the western Mediterranean Sea (WMED). Dissolved amino acid concentrations in the SML were one order of magnitude higher than in the ULW. DON, ammonium, and nitrate were also significantly enriched in the SML as compared with the ULW. Bacterial leucine incorporation ranged between 3 and 50 pmol L-1 h(-1) in the SATL and 5 and 488 pmol L-1 h(-1) in the WMED and was generally not significantly different between the SML and the ULW. In contrast, bacterial respiration was significantly higher in the SML than in the ULW, varying between 3.6 and 9.5 mu mol L-1 d(-1) O-2 at both sites. The resulting bacterial growth efficiencies ranged between 0.1% and 14% using different leucine incorporation to carbon conversion factors. Given the high dissolved free amino acid (DFAA) yield of DOC (similar to 12%) and of DON (similar to 30%) in the SML, bacterial growth efficiencies in the SML were low. This indicates that the DFAA in the SML are not readily available for bacteria. The underlying mechanisms of this immobilization of DFAA in the SML and their production remain enigmatic.

Water in a tidal creek draining brackish, high-elevation marshes was sampled every hour during several semidiurnal tidal cycles in order to examine the tidal exchange of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Water leaving the marsh during ebbing tide was consistently enriched in DOC compared to water entering the marsh during flooding tide. There was a net DOC export from the marsh to the estuary during seasons of both low and high marsh plant biomass. Optical analysis demonstrated that, in addition to contributing to the carbon budgets, the marsh had a strong influence on the estuary's CDOM dynamics. Marsh-exported CDOM had optical properties that were consistently and markedly different from those of CDOM in the adjacent estuary. Specifically, marsh CDOM had: (1) considerably stronger absorption, (2) larger DOC-specific absorption, (3) lower exponential spectral slope, (4) larger fluorescence signal, (5) lower fluorescence per unit absorbance, and (6) higher fluorescence at wavelengths >400 nm. These optical characteristics are indicative of relatively complex, high-molecular-weight, aromatic-rich DOM, and this was confirmed by results of molecular-weight-distribution analysis. Our findings illustrate the importance of tidal marshes as sources of optically and chemically distinctive dissolved organic compounds, and their influence on CDOM dynamics, DOC budgets, and, thus, photochemical and biogeochemical processes, in adjacent estuarine ecosystems.

Cooling lakes while the world warms: Effects of forest regrowth and increased dissolved organic matter on the thermal regime of a temperate, urban lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Depending on the magnitudes and directions of changes in air temperatures, winds, and underwater light attenuation, lakes may either warm or cool. Here we report a 28-yr decrease in the whole-lake average temperature of Clearwater Lake, Canada, despite regional signatures of climate warming. Using a one-dimensional lake mixing model, we demonstrate that this pattern was attributable to a 35% reduction in surface wind speeds, itself explained by forest regrowth following local SO(2) emission reductions and tree planting, and a 10-fold increase in dissolved organic carbon concentrations causing a substantial increase in vertical light attenuation following deacidification of the lake. Long-term trends in lake temperatures do not necessarily follow those of air temperatures. The Clearwater Lake data demonstrate that any factors that influence local wind speeds and underwater light attenuation should be considered as modifiers of the effects of climate warming on lake thermal regimes.

Photodegradation, interaction with iron oxides and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter from forested floodplain sources	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) can influence food webs by altering the availability of carbon to microbial communities, and may be particularly important following periods of high DOM input (e. g. flooding of forested floodplains). Iron oxides can facilitate these reactions, but their influence on subsequent organic products is poorly understood. Degradation experiments with billabong (= oxbow lake) water and river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) leaf leachate were conducted to assess the importance of these reactions in floodplain systems. Photochemical degradation of DOM in sunlight-irradiated quartz tubes (with and without amorphous iron oxide) was studied using gas chromatography and UV-visible spectroscopy. Photochemical reactions generated gaseous products and small organic acids. Bioavailability of billabong DOM increased following irradiation, whereas that of leaf leachate was not significantly altered. Fluorescence excitation-emission spectra suggested that the humic component of billabong organic matter was particularly susceptible to degradation, and the source of DOM influenced the changes observed. The addition of amorphous iron oxide increased rates of photochemical degradation of leachate and billabong DOM. The importance of photochemical reactions to aquatic systems will depend on the source of the DOM and its starting bioavailability, whereas inputs of freshly formed iron oxides will accelerate the processes.

J	Israelsson, O				Israelsson, Olle			Xenoturbella (Deuterostomia) probably feeds on dissolved organic matter	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												The enigmatic deuterostome Xenoturbella does ubiquitously contain exogenous nucleic acids. This has been used in several papers as proof of selective feeding by Xenoturbella on nuculid bivalves. However, their feeding biology is unknown and exogenous nucleic acids might not originate from their main nutrient source. I have examined the possible pathways of nutrient uptake. The animals neither took up cells nor dissolved dyes through the 'mouth'. Instead, they possessed extensive pinocytosis through the epidermis. Therefore, it is probable that the main source of nutrients is dissolved organic matter uptaken through the epidermis. This does not exclude that phagocytosis in the gastrodermis does occur, e.g. due to direct expose of the gastrodermis during asexual reproduction. The ubiquitously present exogenous nucleic acids in Xenoturbella probably do originate from such events and not from their main food source.																	1745-1000						2008	4	5					384	391		10.1080/17451000802036085						WOS:000259696000007

Bioavailability of macroalgal dissolved organic matter in seawater	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The bioavailability of macroalgal dissolved organic matter (DOM) was examined by decomposition experiments using released DOM from Ecklonia cava Kjellman (Phaeophyceae) living in Oura Bay, Shimoda, Izu Peninsula, Japan. The samples used for the decomposition experiments were obtained by enclosing the plants in bags. Based on the reduction rates of the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the turnover times of the macroalgal DOC were calculated to be between 24 and 172 d, with monthly-seasonal timescales. These values were mostly higher than those of phytoplanktonic DOC in previous studies (<1 mo). The relatively longer turnover time probably reflects the bio-refractory property of the macroalgal DOM. In most of the experiments (except for June), fucans and humic-like material were the major constituents of the released DOM. The fucans appeared to be partly decomposed during the experiments, but the compositional changes in the neutral carbohydrates in these seasons were less definite than those in June. The fluorescent intensity of the humic-like material did not decrease with time, suggesting a refractory character. Macroalgae are likely important DOM producers in Oura Bay, because the daily DOM production of E. cava accounts for 1.5 to 34% of DOM stock in Oura Bay per day. The concentration and the distribution of DOC inside and outside the bay strongly suggests that the released DOM was extensively exported out of the bay. These facts indicate that the macroalgal DOM contributes to marine DOM pools in a wider area including the adjacent coastal region.

CDOM absorption at 412 nm a(cdom)(412) increased seven-fold from 0.74 m(-1) near the Barataria Pass to about 5.2 m(-1) at locations influenced by freshwater sources in the upper basin. Although CDOM absorption generally increased with decreasing salinity (in salinity range 23.26 to 1.03), nonlinearity at the mid-salinity range suggested additional CDOM sources in the bay. At the freshwater end (salinity between 0.12-0.38) CDOM absorption varied between 3.4 to 5.2 m(-1) suggesting the various streams and small lakes to have varied concentrations of CDOM possibly contributing to the large CDOM variability. CDOM spectral slope coefficient S (nm(-1)) provides a measure of the decrease of absorption with increasing wavelength and has been used as an indicator of water types. S varied from a low of 0.0154 nm(-1) at a station near the Barataria Pass to a high of 0.0176 nm(-1) at one of the freshwater sources upstream in the bay with S increasing gradually with decreasing salinity suggesting a strong freshwater influence on CDOM spectral slope. However, it was observed that below the 1.03 salinity level values of S were between 0.0164-0.0176 nm(-1) and variable indicating that the different freshwater sources to the Barataria bay to potentially have different CDOM spectral characteristics.																	0197-7385		978-1-4244-2619-5				2008							1569	1572								WOS:000265654501062		
J	Dittmar, T				Dittmar, Thorsten			The molecular level determination of black carbon in marine dissolved organic matter	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Products from incomplete combustion of organic carbon (black carbon) are ubiquitous in the environment. However, the available information on black carbon in marine dissolved organic matter (DOM), one of the largest organic carbon pools, is extremely scarce. The objective of this study was to introduce an analytical technique for the routine determination of black carbon in marine DOM. Dissolved black carbon was isolated from seawater via solid phase extraction. The salt free extracts were oxidized with nitric acid in a microwave digestion system. Oxidation temperature and duration were optimized to yield maximum amounts of benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) from condensed aromatic structures. BPCAs were separated and quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography and diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). Minimal sample processing and no derivatization are required which makes the method practical for routine analysis. The technique was tested on a suite of reference materials and applied to coastal and open ocean DOM. One half liter of seawater from the open Gulf of Mexico was sufficient for reliable analysis. Black carbon free DOM from algal cultures and organic tissues did not yield detectable amounts of BPCA (< 0.02% of total dissolved organic carbon, DOC), whereas all seawater samples yielded significant amounts of BPCA. An algorithm was developed for the transformation of BPCA into black carbon concentrations in the ocean. Black carbon concentrations decreased from near to offshore from 3.7 to 0.8 mM C (2.6-0.9% of DOC). The proportion of the individual BPCAs provided basic structural information on dissolved black carbon. Low proportions of hexacarboxylic acids (B6CA) in marine DOM is consistent with the relatively small size (seven condensed rings) deduced from mass spectrometry data. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Canonica, S; Laubscher, HU				Canonica, Silvio; Laubscher, Hans-Ulrich			Inhibitory effect of dissolved organic matter on triplet-induced oxidation of aquatic contaminants	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Excited triplet states of organic chromophores, in particular aromatic ketones, are capable of inducing oxidation of a variety of organic compounds. These reactions probably play an important role in the degradation of organic contaminants in sunlit natural waters. The effect of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) on the oxidation rate of twenty-two aquatic organic contaminants, including phenols, anilines, phenylurea and s-triazine herbicides, and some pharmaceuticals, was investigated using photoexcited benzophenone-4-carboxylate (CBBP) as the oxidant. For about half of the studied compounds, a decrease in depletion rate was observed in the presence of Suwannee River fulvic acid, used as a reference DOM. Also, depletion rates decreased with increasing DOM concentration, as verified for five selected compounds. Such an inhibitory effect of DOM on oxidation is attributed to its antioxidant properties, whereby oxidation intermediates of the contaminants are supposed to be reduced back to their parent compounds. The presented screening study shows that DOM may be a relevant factor for inhibiting the oxidation of many organic contaminants in surface waters and possibly in engineered water treatment systems.																	1474-905X						2008	7	5					547	551		10.1039/b719982a						WOS:000255743700006	18465010

The DOM in groundwaters from two compartmentalised bodies of groundwater of distinctly different origin within the Aspo Underground Research Laboratory (URL), Sweden and in Baltic seawater has been isolated using tangential flow ultrafiltration (TUF) and diafiltration. Recoveries of DOM ranged from 34.7 to 0.1 mg/L with substantial differences in the concentrations of the groundwaters collected only 120 m apart. Analysis by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) of the isolated DOM revealed that the groundwaters contained abundant alkylphenols which may represent heavily decomposed proteins or lignins originating from biopolymers contained within soils. The difference in the distribution and relative abundance of major pyrolysis products groups such as alkyphenols confirmed that the groundwater and Baltic seawater DOM samples were chemically distinct indicating minimal infiltration of marine groundwater derived by recharge from the Baltic or earlier Littorina Sea within the two compartmentalised groundwater bodies.

Fluorescence peak I (fulvic-like) and peak II (humic-like) were strong, while peak IV and peak V (protein-like) were weak or even undetected in some samples. Fluorescence peaks in various waters and different zones showed great difference in intensities and the fluorescence peaks in underground water tended to be much lower than those of surface waters. Furthermore, the fluorescence peaks of rivers and lakes were higher than those of mine drainage, and also the fluorescence peaks in coking zone and coal mining zone were higher than those in sewage-irrigated zone, or even much higher than those in farming zone. The reason may be that coal mining activities and coal industry can bring plenty of organic matter from coal to surroundings. Meanwhile, surface water would accept mine drainage, waste water of coal-washing and sewage from daily life easier than underground water, so surface water can be polluted seriously. Fluorescence peaks in waters from coal mining area are little influenced by pH of the water but can be influenced by the content of Ca2+ to water in some extent.																	1000-0593					JAN	2008	28	1					174	177								WOS:000252809900041

Functional variability of dissolved organic matter from the surface water of a productive lake	WATER RESEARCH												Functional variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the surface water of Esthwaite Water (N. England) was investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays, which provide quantitative information on light absorption, fluorescence, photochemical fading, pH buffering, copper binding, benzo(a)pyrene binding, hydrophilicity, and adsorption to alumina. Ten lakewater samples were collected at different times of year during 2003-2005, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid was used as a quality control standard. For nine of the assays, variability among DOM samples was significantly (p < 0.01) greater than could be explained by analytical error. Seasonal trends observed for six of the assays could be explained by a simple mixing model in which the two end-members were DOM from the catchment (allochthonous) and DOM produced within the lake (autochthonous). The fraction of autochthonous DOM predicted by the model is significantly correlated (p<0.01) with chlorophyll concentration, consistent with production from phytoplankton. Autochthonous DOM is less light-absorbing, less fluorescent, more hydrophilic, and possesses fewer proton-dissociating groups, than allochthonous material. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal and spatial variations in characteristics of Lake Biwa dissolved organic matter: sorption of pyrene and its derivatives and fluorescence properties	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The objectives of this research were to investigate seasonal and spatial variations in ( 1) sorption of pyrene and its derivatives onto dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ( 2) fluorescence properties of DOM in Lake Biwa, Japan. In the case of pyrene, sorption coefficient (K(doc)) of Lake Biwa DOM seasonally changed from 1,200 to 3,800 L/kgC. Vertical distribution of K(doc) was affected by thermocline formation in summer, while it was uniformly distributed as a result of vertical mixing in winter. Functional groups affected sorption of pyrene onto Lake Biwa DOM in different manner from that onto Suwannee River fulvic acid. Three-dimensional excitation emission matrices (3D-EEMs) fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize Lake Biwa DOMs and indicated the existence of at least two fluorophores. The two major peaks at Ex230/Em300 and Ex230/Em425 originated from protein-like and fulvic/humic-like substances, respectively. The peak at Ex230/Em300 showed the maximum fluorescence intensity at a depth of 5m and could be affected by stratification of the water column in summer. On the other hand, the peak at Ex230/Em425 showed similar profiles both in summer and in winter. These results demonstrably showed that sorption of micropollutants and fluorescence properties of Lake Biwa DOMs were seasonally and spatially varied.																	0273-1223						2008	58	8					1609	1614		10.2166/wst.2008.743						WOS:000261150900012	19001715

Major structural components in freshwater dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains a complex array of chemical components that are intimately linked to many environmental processes, including the global carbon cycle, and the fate and transport of chemical pollutants. Despite its importance, fundamental aspects, such as the structural components in DOM remain elusive, due in part to the molecular complexity of the material. Here, we utilize multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to demonstrate the major structural components in Lake Ontario DOM. These include carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), heteropolysaccharides, and aromatic compounds, which are consistent with components recently identified in marine dissolved organic matter (1). In addition, long-range proton-carbon correlations are obtained for DOM, which support the existence of material derived from linear terpenoids (MOLT). It is tentatively suggested that the bulk of freshwater dissolved organic matter is aliphatic in nature, with CRAM derived from cyclic terpenoids, and MOLT derived from linear terpenoids. This is in agreement with previous reports which indicate terpenoids as major precursors of DOM (2). At this time it is not clear in Lake Ontario whether these precursors are of terrestrial or aquatic origin or whether transformations proceed via biological and/or photochemical processes.

Measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and analysis of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEM) were conducted in an effort to characterize spatial variability in concentration and source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and to further understand the hydrochemical functioning of this complex environment. Increasing pH under the influence of evaporation resulted in an increasing DOC solubility ranging from 50 to over 300 mgC L-1 in surface water. Spectrofluorescence characterisation indicates the presence of several families of dissolved organic matter (fulvic and humic-type and proteinaceous materials), which are related to the type of lake and its hydro-bio-geochemical functioning. Moreover, the fluorescence signatures from lake water DOM and from surrounding soil-water-extracted organic matter (WEOM) show strong similarities although some labile proteinaceous compounds disappeared during humification. Results from the characterisation of DOM and WEOM not only suggest that spectrofluorescence is a reliable technique for the tracing of water flows, but also for the marking of the origin of organic horizons in this environment.

Dissolved organic matter assimilation by heterotrophic bacterial groups in the western Arctic Ocean	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Abundance of the major bacterial groups and dissolved organic matter (DOM) assimilation in the western Arctic Ocean were determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microautoradiography combined with FISH (Micro-FISH). Cytophaga-like bacteria (25 to 65 %) and Alphaproteobacteria (17 to 40%) were the dominant bacterial groups, followed by Gammaproteobacteria (10 to 30 %). In contrast, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria were never abundant. While the distribution of Alphaproteobacteria was relatively uniform along a transect from the shelf to the basin, Cytophaga-like bacteria were more abundant on the shelf and shelf-break. Similarly, the contribution to DOM assimilation by Cytophaga-like bacteria was highest on the shelf and lowest in the basin. In contrast, Alphaproteobacteria contributed the most to DOM assimilation at the slope. About 80 to 99 % of the variation in DOM assimilation was explained by bacterial group abundance. As a whole, the prokaryotic community was most active in assimilating free amino acids (50 to 60 %), followed by diatom-derived extracellular polymers (30 to 40 %) and protein (20 to 30 %). In contrast, relatively few cells assimilated glucose (10 to 20 %). This study revealed substantial variation in the abundance of major bacterial groups among the Arctic regions and in the assimilation of DOM components by these bacteria.

For the extractions, deionized water, synthetic pore water (SPW, water containing all major ions at pore water concentrations but no organic matter) and 0.1 M NaOH were used. The influence of the solid-to-liquid ratio, extraction time, acid -pretreatment and O-2 exposure of the rock material on the isolated DOM were investigated. Liquid chromatography coupled with a total organic C detector (LC-OCD) and reverse-phase ion chromatography were used to characterize the DOM size distributions and to determine the low molecular weight organic acid (LMWOA) contents in the pore water samples and the rock extracts. The results revealed that only a small portion of the total organic C of the rock material (<0.38%) was extractable, even after removal of carbonates by acid-pretreatment. The concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC) were found to range from 3.9 +/- 0.4 to 8.0 +/- 0.8 mg/L in the anoxic extracts. The pore waters exhibited similar DOC concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 15.8 +/- 0.5 mg/L. The analysis by LC-OCD showed that the DOM extracted under anoxic conditions and the pore water DOM mainly consisted of hydrophilic compounds of less than 500 Da. The DOM extracted with SPW was most similar in size to the pore water DOM. Grinding the rock under oxic conditions increased the DOC yields and shifted the size distribution toward higher molecular weight compounds compared to the strictly anoxic treatment. Acetate, lactate and formate were identified in all extracts and in the pore water. In total, LMWOA accounted for 36% of the total DOC in both pore water and SPW extracts. The results imply that controlled anoxic conditions and the use of SPW as an extractant are required to isolate DOM from Opalinus Clay rocks which most resembles the in situ pore water DOM with respect to its size distribution and the LMWOA contents.

J	Kalbitz, K; Meyer, A; Yang, R; Gerstberger, P				Kalbitz, Karsten; Meyer, Armin; Yang, Rong; Gerstberger, Pedro			Response of dissolved organic matter in the forest floor to long-term manipulation of litter and throughfall inputs	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contributes to organic carbon either stored in mineral soil horizons or exported to the hydrosphere. However, the main controls of DOM dynamics are still under debate. We studied fresh leaf litter and more decomposed organic material as the main sources of DOM exported from the forest floor of a mixed beech/oak forest in Germany. In the field we doubled and excluded aboveground litter input and doubled the input of throughfall. From 1999 to 2005 we measured concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic C and N (DOC, DON) beneath the Oi and Oe/Oa horizon. DOM composition was traced by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. In selected DOM samples we analyzed the concentrations of phenols, pentoses and hexoses, and lignin-derived phenols by CuO oxidation. DOC and DON concentrations and fluxes almost doubled instantaneously in both horizons of the forest floor by doubling the litter input and DOC concentrations averaged 82 mg C l(-1) in the Oe/Oa horizon. Properties of DOM did not suggest a change of the main DOM source towards fresh litter. In turn, increasing ratios of hexoses to pentoses and a larger content of lignin-derived phenols in the Oe/Oa horizon of the Double litter plots in comparison to the Control plots indicated a priming effect: Addition of fresh litter stimulated microbial activity resulting in increased microbial production of DOM from organic material already stored in Oe/Oa horizons. Exclusion of litter input resulted in an immediate decrease in DOC concentrations and fluxes in the thin Oi horizon. In the Oe/Oa horizon DOC concentrations started to decline in the third year and were significantly smaller than those in the Control after 5 years. Properties of DOM indicated an increased proportion of microbially and throughfall derived compounds after exclusion of litter inputs. Dissolved organic N did not decrease upon litter exclusion. We assume a microbial transformation of mineral N from throughfall and N mineralization to DON. Increased amounts of throughfall resulted in almost equivalently increased DOC fluxes in the Oe/Oa horizon. However, long-term additional throughfall inputs resulted in significantly declining DOC concentrations over time. We conclude that DOM leaving the forest floor derives mainly from decomposed organic material stored in Oe/Oa horizons. Leaching of organic matter from fresh litter is of less importance. Observed effects of litter manipulations strongly depend on time and the stocks of organic matter in forest floor horizons. Long-term experiments are particularly necessary in soils/horizons with large stocks of organic matter and in studies focusing on effects of declined substrate availability. The expected increased primary production upon climate change with subsequently enhanced litter input may result in an increased production of DOM from organic soil horizons.

Copper binding by dissolved organic matter in freshwaters in Kenya	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The binding of Cu2+ to dissolved organic matter in eight different natural water samples obtained from different locations in Kenya was studied by potentiometric titration method. The DOC contents of the eight natural water samples ranged from 2.71 to 374 mg/L. The water samples were adjusted to a uniform background electrolyte concentration of 0.5 M NaNO3 and pH 6 and the temperature maintained at 20 degrees C during the assay. A Nernst equation E (mV) = -32.175 pCu + 305.5 (R-2 =0.9996) obtained for the Cu2+ calibration standards (10(-4) - 10(-6) M) was used to determine the concentration of free and bound Cu2+, respectively. The bound [Cu2+] varied by a factor of 2, ranging from 2.67 x 10(-3) mol/kg DOC (in a high DOC alkaline lake water sample) to 3.2962 x 10(-1) mol/kg (in a low DOC river water sample). The binding constants (Log K) varied by a factor of 2 and ranged from 3.43 to 5.57. The percentage binding ranged from 87% to almost 100% in the eight natural water samples. A Suwannee River Fulvic Acid standard sample (40 mg/L DOC) was used for comparison and for validation of the method.

Absorption by CDOM was modeled as a logarithmic function. As a qualitative index of CDOM, the slope (S) of this function was estimated for a wavelength range from 280 to 500nm. As a quantitative index of CDOM, the integration of absorption was determined between 280 and 500 mn (Sigma(500)(280)a(CDOM)). High seasonal variability of S values was observed at the marine station. The S values at the upstream stations were related to chlorophyll a concentrations but not to bacterial abundance, whereas the integrated values at upstream stations were correlated with precipitation. Seasonal variability in the integrated values was low at the downstream stations, where the effect of effluent from non-point sources and sewage treatment plants was strong. Anthropogenic CDOM at the downstream stations appeared to be degraded by microbial utilization and photodegradation, whereas terrestrially derived CDOM at the upstream stations was less degraded. These qualitative differences in CDOM and the marked effect of dilution by seawater near the Sakawa River mouth suggest that the dynamics of CDOM in riverine and coastal environments should be studied with careful consideration of both spatial and temporal variations, particularly in small estuaries.																	1439-8621					DEC	2007	8	3					211	217		10.1007/s10201-007-0216-2						WOS:000251677800002

High-altitude lakes in the Yunnan Plateau are exposed to high intensities of UVR and contain low concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Thirty-eight lakes in the Yunnan Plateau with elevations from 1291 to 3809m above sea level were investigated to study CDOM concentrations and possible effects of UVR on the lake ecosystem. The attenuation of UVR in the Yunnan Plateau lakes was calculated from the absorption coefficient of CDOM based on an empirical relationship from lakes in the Alps and Pyrenees mountains. Absorption coefficients [a(lambda)] at 320nm [a(320)] ranged from 0.52 to 14.05 m(-1) (mean standard deviation, 4.40 3.85 m(-1)) and at 380 nm [a(380)] from 0.05 to 4.51 m(-1) (1.40 1.30m(-1)). The exponential slope coefficient for the relationship of wavelength to a(lambda) ranged from 16.2 to 41.4 mu m(-1) (21.74 +/- 4.93 mu m(-1)) over the 280-400nm interval. Normalized fluorescence emission (NFLU) at 450nm from an excitation wavelength of 355 nm, F-n(355), averaged 7.93 +/- 3.22 NFLU. A significant positive relationship was found between a(355) and F,(355). The estimated diffuse attenuation coefficients of UV-B (320nm) and UV-A (380nm) ranged from 0.55 to 15.77 m(-1) and from 0.24 to 6.73 m(-1); the corresponding 1% attenuation depths ranged from 0.29 to 8.44 m and from 0.68 to 19.42 m. Twenty-five of 38 lakes had 1% UV-13 attenuation depths of 1.5 m or more. The median 1% attenuation depth was 28.8% of the sampling depth for UV-B radiation and 60% for UV-A.

The CDOM concentrations (a(355)) of fresh end members in the Jiulong River Estuary varied seasonally, while its quality remained relatively stable. However, the a(355) of the marine end members exhibited less variability. Application of a conservative mixing model indicated that CDOM behaved conservatively in the Yangtze River Estuary. No photobleaching removal was observed at high salinity region of this estuary. Although CDOM showed conservative behavior for many cruises in the Jiulong River Estuary, there was evidence for removal in the low salinity regions during some cruises. Laboratory mixing experiments and a salt addition experiment suggested that particle sorption of CDOM maybe the possible reason for the removal. These results showed that absorption properties of CDOM can be used as a tool to observe the quantitative and qualitative dynamics of DOM during estuarine mixing. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Tracing terrigenous dissolved organic matter and its photochemical decay in the ocean by using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry	MARINE CHEMISTRY					9th International Estuarine Biogeochemistry Symposium	MAY 07-11, 2006	Warnemunde, GERMANY	German Res Fdn, German Fed Minist Educ Res, IOW, AWI				Reversed-phase liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is introduced as a new molecular fingerprinting technique for tracing terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its photochemical decay in the ocean. DOM along a transect from the mangrove-fringed coast in Northern Brazil to the shelf edge was compared with mangrove-derived porewater DOM exposed to natural sunlight for 2-10 days in a photodegradation experiment. DOM was isolated from all samples via solid-phase extraction (C18) for LC/MS analysis. DOM in the estuary and ocean showed a bimodal mass distribution with two distinct maxima in the lower m/z range from 400 to 1000 Da (intensity-weighted average of 895 Da). Terrigenous porewater DOM from the mangroves was characterized by a broad molecular mass distribution over the detected range from 150 to 2000 Da (intensity-weighted average of 1130 Da). Polar compounds, i.e., those that eluted early in the reversed-phase chromatography, absorbed more UV light and bad on average smaller molecular masses than the more apolar compounds. After 10 days of irradiation (similar to 70 kWh/m(2)), mangrove DOM resembled open-ocean DOM in its mass distribution (intensity-weighted average of 885 Da). In addition, a large fraction of UV-absorbing compounds, which were present in mangrove samples but absent in offshore samples, were not detected after photodegradation. However, the bimodal mass distribution in ocean waters was not reproduced during photodegradation. This mass distribution is certainly a reflection of specific molecular properties of marine DOM which systematically differed from the mangrove samples. The molecular patterns of DOM in the ocean did not show significant contribution of terrigenous DOM, which is in contrast to previous stable carbon isotope analysis. If, however, photochemical modifications of the terrigenous component are considered as an additional mechanism besides simple mixing of two end members (marine and mangrove), the observed molecular patterns of oceanic DOM are consistent with the contribution of terrigenous DOM in these samples. In order to explore the molecular mass information, the mass spectra of the different samples were compared through multivariate statistics. Cluster analyses and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) revealed significant differences between mangrove and oceanic DOM that successively disappeared in the course of the photodegradation experiment. With help of discriminant analyses, the similarity between photodegraded mangrove DOM and open-ocean DOM could be confirmed on an individual m/z level. Though conventional ion trap mass spectrometry (resolving power of similar to 1000) does not resolve the complexity of DOM at the level of single molecules, it does provide detailed molecular fingerprints. This molecular fingerprinting technique provides a means to trace DOM and modifications in its molecular structure in aquatic systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, YP; Yadav, A; Karanfil, T				Guo, Yanping; Yadav, Abhishek; Karanfil, Tanju			Approaches to mitigate the impact of dissolved organic matter on the adsorption of synthetic organic contaminants by porous carbonaceous sorbents	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Adsorption of trichloroethylene (TCE) and atrazine, two synthetic organic contaminants (SOCs) having different optimum adsorption pore regions, by four activated carbons and an activated carbon fiber (ACF) was examined. The selected adsorbents had a wide range of pore size distributions but similar surface acidity and hydrophobicity. Single solute and preloading (with a dissolved organic matter (DOM)) isotherms were performed. Single solute adsorption results showed that (i) the adsorbents having higher amounts of pores with sizes about the dimensions of the adsorbate molecules exhibited higher uptakes, (ii) there were some pore structure characteristics, which were not completely captured by pore size distribution analysis, that also affected the adsorption, and (iii) the BET surface area and total pore volume were not the primary factors controlling the adsorption of SOCs. The preloading isotherm results showed that for TCE adsorbing primarily in pores < 10 angstrom, the highly microporous ACF and GACs, acting like molecular sieves, exhibited the highest uptakes. For atrazine with an optimum adsorption pore region of 10-20 angstrom, which overlaps with the adsorption region of some DOM components, the GACs with a broad pore size distribution and high pore volumes in the 10-20 angstrom region had the least impact of DOM on the adsorption.

ESI-MS analyses of lake dissolved organic matter in light of supramolecular assembly	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) system was coupled on-line to an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to detect gas-phase ions by an API 365 LC/MS/MS triple quadrupole analyzer. The SEC fractions of a strongly coloured freshwater solution containing dissolved organic matter-humic substances (DOM-HS) were screened both by UV254 and by ESI mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in the full-scan mode within the m/z range of 100-2,900 amu in negative and positive polarities. The ESI-MS spectra were also collected by direct infusion of the DOM-HS solution in both polarities. ESI-MS spectra did not primarily favour low mass compounds, and negative and positive total ion chromatograms were parallel to the SEC elution profile obtained by UV254 detection from DOM-HS solution. The UV254 detection overestimated the SEC portion of higher size/mass solutes and underestimated that of solutes of smaller sizes/masses as compared with the total ion chromatogram intensities in negative or positive polarities. The change of mass-weighted and number-weighted average sizes/masses (M-w and M-n) of different SEC fractions was fairly small, in contrast to UV254 detection, with increasing elution volume. A reasonable explanation for the great differences between M-w and M-n values, obtained by UV254 and ESI-MS detections for eight different SEC fractions, seems to be a supramolecular-type association of relatively small components through weak dispersive forces. M-n values obtained by vapour-pressure osmometry for different SEC fractions were to some extent analogous with those of negative and positive ESI-MS. The shapes obtained by either negative or positive polarities and calculated M-w and M-n values indicated a close structural similarity between each SEC fraction. Positive ion and negative ion spectra of different humic fractions represented quite similar components, and there was no evidence for noteworthy occurrence of multiply charged ions being able to lower mass distributions of negative ion spectra. The effect of nitrogen on the mass spectra seemed to be unimportant, and the weak ions observed at even m/z values correspond most likely to the C-13 counterparts of the more abundant C-12 odd ions. No uncontrolled ESI fragmentation was observable and humic solutes seemed to be quite heat-resistant. Direct infusion of the untreated DOM-HS solution and statistical calculation verified that the SEC-separated different fractions really represent distinct entities of the original DOM-HS mixture. ESI-MS results support the opinion that the structural composition of humic solutes in their original combined mixture resembles supramolecular-type associations of smaller molecular size entities possessing similar structural functionalities.

This study pointed out that fluorescence static quenching modeling (FSQM), which often uses a Stern - Volmer type plot to process the data from fluorescence quenching experiments, is conceptually different from the classic Stern - Volmer equation. We also emphasized that although linear Stern - Volmer plots are generally observed in literature, it does not necessarily indicate a linear HOC - DOM interaction. According to both mathematical simulation and laboratory sorption experiments in this study, nonlinear interactions could be concealed by the use of Stern - Volmer plot. Moreover, this study tested the two assumptions for applying FSQM to process binding data. Our results showed that binding coefficient (KDoc) for phenanthrene is neither independent of free solute concentration, nor DOM concentration, which is a critical limitation for using FSQM in a form of Stern - Volmer equation to examine HOC - DOM interactions. Therefore, the true characteristics of HOC - DOM interactions need to be examined using different ways of experimental design and data processing. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This industrial estate, the largest in northern Thailand, has proposed to utilization of reclaimed treated wastewater in their raw water supply so as to cope with the yearly water shortage during the dry season. Water samples were collected four times from four sampling points and evaluated for their dissolved organic matter (DOM) content in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm (UV-254), specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVA), trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) and trihalomethane (THM) species. Average values of DOC, UV-254, SUVA and THMFP in the influent wastewater of 12.9 mg L-1, 0.165 cm(-1), 1.29 L mg(-1)m(-1) and 1.24 mg L-1, respectively, were observed. The aeration ponds produced the best results: a 54% reduction of DOC, a 33% reduction of UV-254, and a 57% reduction of THMFP. However, SUVA in the aeration pond effluent showed a moderate increase. The facultative ponds and oxidation ponds did not take part in the reduction of DOC, UV-254, SUVA and THMFP. Average DOC, UV-254, SUVA and THMFP value of the treated wastewater were 5.8 mg L-1, 0.107 cm(-1), 1.85 L mg(-1)m(-1) and 468 mu g L-1, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The origin of dissolved organic matter (DOM) within sea ice in coastal waters of the Baltic Sea was investigated using parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of DOM fluorescence. Sea ice DOM had distinctly different fluorescence characteristics than that of the underlying humic-rich waters and was dominated by protein-like fluorescence signals. PARAFAC analysis identified five fluorescent components, all of which were present in both sea ice and water. Three humic components were negatively correlated to salinity and concluded to be terrestrially derived material. Baltic Sea ice DOM was found to be a mixture of humic material from the underlying water column incorporated during ice formation and autochthonous material produced by organism within the ice. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations were correlated to the humic fluorescence, indicating that the majority of the organic carbon and nitrogen in Baltic Sea ice is bound in terrestrial humic material trapped within the ice. This has implications for our understanding of sea ice carbon cycling in regions influenced by riverine input (e.g., Baltic and Arctic coastal waters), as the susceptibility of DOM to degradation and remineralization is largely determined by its source.

Influence of dissolved organic matter and Fe(II) on the abiotic reduction of pentachloronitrobenzene	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Nitroaromatic pesticides (NAPS) are hydrophobic contaminants that can accumulate in sediments by the deposition of suspended solids from surface waters. Fe(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM), present in suboxic and anoxic zones of freshwater sediments, can transform NAPs in natural systems. We studied the reduction of pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) to pentachloroaniline (PCA) in controlled studies using Fe(II) and surface water DOM isolates from Pony Lake, Antarctica, and Suwannee River, GA, in unfiltered and 0.45 mu m filtered solutions. We observed rapid reduction of PCNB to PCA in the presence of Fe(II)) and DOM (t(1/2) approximate to 30 min to 4 h) and very limited reduction in DOM-only systems. DOM in unfiltered systems inhibited iron colloid formation and potentially limited the formation of reactive Fe(II)-iron colloid surface complexes, causing reductive transformation in Fe(II)-DOM media. to be slower in some cases relative to Fe(II)-only controls. Conversely, in 0.45 mu m filtered solutions, PCNB reduction in Fe(II)-DOM media was faster than the Fe(II)-only controls, suggesting that DOM enhances the reductive capacity of Fe(II)) in the absence of iron colloids. This work shows that DOM may significantly affect the reactivity of Fe(II) toward NAPS under suboxic and anoxic conditions in natural wetland sediments.																	0013-936X					NOV 1	2007	41	21					7337	7342		10.1021/es070648c						WOS:000250556100027	18044508

The CDOM absorption was significantly higher in winter than in summer, due to degradation and release of fixed carbon in phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). The hyperbolic model was used to model the spectral absorption of CDOM, and the mean spectral slope of 6.38 nm(-1) was obtained. At most sites, the spectral absorption of non-phytoplankton particles was similar to that of the total particles, demonstrating that the absorption of the total particles is dominated by the absorption of non-phytoplankton particles. In summer, phytoplankton absorption increased markedly, due to frequent algal blooms especially in Meiliang Bay. In winter, the significant increase in non-phytoplankton particle absorption resulted from the increase of inorganic particulate matter caused by sediment resuspension. Strong linear relationships were found between ad(440) and total suspended matter (TSM), organic suspended matter (OSM), and inorganic suspended matter (ISM). Strong linear relationships were also found between a(ph)(440), a(ph)(675) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. The total relative contributions of non-phytoplankton particles over the range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (400-700 nm) were 48.4 and 79.9% in summer and winter respectively. Non-phytoplankton particle absorption dominated the total absorption, especially in winter, in Lake Taihu, due to frequent sediment resuspension in the large shallow lake as a result of strong windy conditions. The results indicate that strong absorption by CDOM and non-phytoplankton particles at the blue wavelength has an impact on the spectral availability, and acts as a selection factor for the composition of the phytoplankton community, with cyanobacteria being the dominate species in Lake Taihu.

Diurnal variability in riverine dissolved organic matter composition determined by in situ optical measurement in the San Joaquin River (California, USA)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and composition in riverine and stream systems are known to vary with hydrological and productivity cycles over the annual and interannual time scales. Rivers are commonly perceived as homogeneous with respect to DOM concentration and composition, particularly under steady flow conditions over short time periods. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of short term variability (<1 day) on DOM dynamics. This study examined whether diurnal processes measurably altered DOM concentration and composition in the hypereutrophic San Joaquin River (California) during a relatively quiescent period. We evaluated the efficacy of using optical in situ measurements to reveal changes in DOM which may not be evident from bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurement alone. The in situ optical measurements described in this study clearly showed for the first time diurnal variations in DOM measurements, which have previously been related to both composition and concentration, even though diurnal changes were not well reflected in bulk DOC concentrations. An apparent asynchronous trend of DOM absorbance and chlorophyll-a in comparison to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence and spectral slope S(290-350) suggests that no one specific CDOM spectrophotometric measurement explains absolutely DOM diurnal variation in this system; the measurement of multiple optical parameters is therefore recommended. The observed diurnal changes in DOM composition, measured by in situ optical instrumentation likely reflect both photochemical and biologically-mediated processes. The results of this study highlight that short-term variability in DOM composition may complicate trends for studies aiming to distinguish different DOM sources in riverine systems and emphasizes the importance of sampling specific study sites to be compared at the same time of day. The utilization of in situ optical technology allows short-term variability in DOM dynamics to be monitored and serves to increase our understanding of its processing and fundamental role in the aquatic environment.

Photobleaching of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in rainwater	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												Significant photodegradation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in rainwater was observed after exposure to simulated sunlight. Fluorescence excitation emission spectra (EEMS) of precipitation revealed the presence of four major peaks all of which degraded upon photolysis with the greatest loss in the region characteristic of marine CDOM. Photobleaching of absorbance also occurred in the wavelength region between 250 and 375 nm with the greatest loss of absorbance in the upper end of the UV-A region near 275 nm. There was a strong positive correlation between absorbance loss and total integrated fluorescence loss suggesting these optical properties and the degree to which they are photobleached in rainwater are directly related. The quantum yield of CDOM photodegradation in rainwater decreased dramatically with increasing wavelength and decreasing energy of incoming radiation with the average quantum yield at 325 nm approximately an order of magnitude greater than at 460 nm. The similarity of photolytic response between rainwater and Cape Fear estuarine CDOM indicates that some fraction of the compounds that make up rainwater CDOM may be derived from surface sources and/or that the processes that produce or modify humic-like substances in the atmosphere result in similar types of compounds as non-atmospheric processes.																	0167-7764					NOV	2007	58	3					219	235		10.1007/s10874-007-9089-3						WOS:000251874800003

Bioavailability of permethrin and cyfluthrin in surface waters with low levels of dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Pyrethroids are widely used insecticides in both agricultural and urban environments, and their potential movement to surface streams and toxicity to susceptible aquatic species is an emerging concern. Natural surface waters usually contain low levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM), Limited data have shown that DOM preparations can significantly alter the bioavailabiliry and toxicity effects of pyrethroids. However, the importance of these effects in natural waters has not been investigated. In this study we measured uptake and acute toxicity of permethrin and cyfluthrin by Daphnia species in 15 surface water samples. Low levels of DOM (320 mg L-1) inhibited cyfluthrin uptake by Daphnia magna and acute toxicity to Ceriadaphnia dubia in most samples. For permethrin, the effects of DOM on bioavailability and toxicity were generally not significant. The effects of DOM on bioavailablity of cyfluthrin could not be explained from the DOC concentration alone, suggesting that properties of DOM were also important in regulating bioavailability. Regression of K-DOC with selected DOM properties revealed significant dependence of K-DOC on the carboxylic acid content of DOM. Moreover, concentrations sensed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers were well correlated with the observed changes in bioaccumulation by D. magna and acute toxicity to C dubia. Therefore, selective sampling methods such as SPME may be used for measuring the bioavailable concentrations of pyrethroids in waters with naturally occurring DOM levels and predicting the actual toxicity effects.																	1537-2537					NOV-DEC	2007	36	6					1678	1685		10.2134/jeq2007.0164						WOS:000250972400015	17940268

Due to their high bioavailability they play a crucial role in the cycles of C and nutrients in soils. The variety of soil processes that involve LMWOS requires identifying their composition to elucidate reactions and transformations. In most studies, LMWOS are extracted under artificial conditions, e.g. batch experiments, which may overestimate the actual concentrations. This study measures the composition of carbohydrates and amino acids in solution of a Haplic Luvisol leached in a column experiment. A combined system for simultaneous leaching and blowout. of CO2 was used to estimate LMWOS decomposition. C-14-labeled glucose was added as a highly sensitive tracer to control the,efficiency of the LMWOS extraction by leaching and to estimate LMWOS decomposition during leaching. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), optimized for soil extracts, was used to analyze LMWOS composition. For HPLC optimization, different preparations of leached solutions (filtration vs. centrifugation, and drying vs. no-drying) were compared. For sugar determination, drying had no influence on the solution concentrations. In contrast, amino acid concentrations significantly decreased by drying LMWOS eluted substances. Combining the HPLC identification of eluted substances with C-14 tracer application revealed that about 5% of the glucose could be leached unchanged within 786min (13.1 h), whereas about 84% remained in the soil, 9% were decomposed to CO2, and 2% were transformed to other LMWOS and recovered in the soil solution. The total amino acid concentration (TAC) in soil solution was about 8.2 mu mol l(-1), dominated by alanine (14.4% of TAQ, glycine (13.4%), glutamic acid (9.9%), serine (9.4%), and leucine (9.3%). The total carbohydrate concentration was about 2.4 mu M, dominated by glucose (29.9%), glucuronic acid (26.8%), and galacturonic acid (17.3%). Ratios of hexoses to pentoses, amino sugars glucosamine to galactosamine, and neutral sugars to uronic acids were determined. All three parameters pointed to the dominant influence of plants as the source of LMWOS in the leached soil solution. Within the small contribution of microorganisms, bacteria dominated over fungi. These used biomarker ratios as well as LMWOS concentrations differed widely from the ones obtained with conventional batch extraction. More research is necessary to evaluate the application of these biomarkers to soil solutions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessing the quality of dissolved organic matter in forest soils using ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Ultraviolet spectrophotometry was used to investigate the effects, 30 yr after planting, of tree species substitution on the aromatic C content and related properties of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Precautions were taken to correct measurements for the absorbance of NO(3) and dissolved Fe. In litter leachates, a significant reduction in the aromatic content of DOC was found in the Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] plantation but not in the beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) plantation. The disturbance of short-term C dynamics thus revealed agreed well with field observations. Significant differences in aromatic content were also found in capillary soil solutions from the two planted stands. Overall, these modifications, produced by the substitution of trees 30 yr previously, mostly concerned the beech plantation. Soil processes, and probably adsorption, played a central role in controlling the quality of DOC in this soil and appeared to be influenced by the species planted. In low-capillary solutions, located in larger pores, changes to the aromatic content were only detectable in the surface soil of the beech plantation. We found a more pronounced effect of tree substitution in high-capillary solutions filling soil micropores, where the aromatic content of DOC might be tightly controlled by soil organic matter. It is difficult to say, however, whether the planting of Douglas-fir had actually accelerated soil recovery, or whether there will be future changes to attain a completely new equilibrium.

A solid understanding of hydroclimatic controls on watershed biogeochemical processes is crucial for water quality control during the monsoon period. We investigated spatio-temporal variations in the concentrations and spectroscopic properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the concentrations of trace metals in Hwangryong River, Korea, during a summer period from the relatively dry month of June through the following months with heavy rainfall. DOM and its spectroscopic properties differed spatially along the river, and also depended on storm and flow characteristics around each sampling time. At a headwater stream draining a forested watershed, the concentrations (measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), aromaticity (measured as specific UV absorbance at 254 nm), and fulvic acid- and protein-like fluorescence of DOM were higher in stormflow than in baseflow waters. DOC concentrations and fluorescence intensities increased along the downstream rural and urban sites, in which DOC and fluorescence were not higher in stormflow waters, except for the 'first flush' at the urban site. The response of DOM in reservoir waters to monsoon rainfalls differed from that of stream and river waters, as illustrated by storm-induced increases in DOM aromaticity and fulvic-like fluorescence, and no significant changes in protein-like fluorescence. The results suggest that surface water DOM and its spectroscopic properties differentially respond to changes in hydroclimatic conditions, depending on watershed characteristics and the influence of anthropogenic organic matter loadings. DOC concentrations and intensities of spectroscopic parameters were positively correlated with some of the measured trace metals (As, Co, and Fe). Further research will be needed to obtain a better understanding of climate effects on the interaction between DOM and trace metals.

J	Liu, XL; Zhang, SZ; Wu, WY; Liu, HL				Liu, Xiaoli; Zhang, Shuzhen; Wu, Wenyong; Liu, Honglu			Metal sorption on soils as affected by the dissolved organic matter in sewage sludge and the relative calculation of sewage sludge application	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												To evaluate the influences of sewage sludge-derived organic matters on metal sorption and on the resultant sludge loading estimates, a batch experiment was conducted to compare the sorption of Ni, Cu and Pb in sewage sludge filtrates (1:20 sewage sludge to water) on eight soils and the adsorption of metals in a reference solution which had the same matrix as the sewage sludge filtrate except dissolved organic material (henceforth referred to as reference solution). Metal sorption could be well fitted by linear isotherm and the dissolved organic matter in sludge significantly depressed the sorption (p < 0.01). The main factor controlling sorption of Ni on different soils was dominated by soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) and sorption of Cu and Pb was by soil organic matter (SOM). The parameters obtained from the sorption isotherm equations were then used to estimate sludge loadings into the soils. When the sorption parameters derived from the reference solution were used for calculation, that is the effect of dissolved organic matter was not considered, the calculated safe application rates are approximately 47.8, 51.4, 34.2, 31.3, 21.7, 46.3, 187.1 and 27.6 t-sludge/ha for the Beijing, Jiangxi, Xiamen, Jilin, Guangdong, Wuhan, Gansu and Xinjiang soils, respectively. However, when the sorption parameters derived from the dissolved organo-metallic complexes are used for calculation, the corresponding application rates are reduced to approximately 6.0, 3.4, 1.9, 10.0, 6.3, 3.6, 7.3 and 3.5 t-sludge/ha, respectively. By this study we can get a conclusion that the effect of sewage sludge derived dissolved organic matter on heavy metal sorption and soil properties should be considered in the course of regulating the safe application rates of sewage sludge to soil.

The experiments were conducted 6 times in different seasons. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the experimental bag generally increased during the first 1-2 days, showing the release of DOC from algae. The daily release rates of DOC varied between 0.12 and 5.8 mgC per g (dry wt) of the algal blades per day. The seasonal variability of the DOC release rate was similar to those of the growth and the photosynthetic rates reported by the previous studies on E. cava in the same location. The fractions of the DOC release of the net primary production accounted for 18-62%. These contributions are comparable to other macroalgae in the previous studies (27-43%) using other macroalgae. Analysis of organic composition of DOM using gas chromatography (neutral aldose composition) and spectrometry (UV-visible and fluorescence) indicates that E. cava usually release extracellular products containing mucilaginous polysaccharides containing fucose as a main constituent and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The release of these organic compounds is likely performed as the ordinary metabolism of brown algae. An exceptional release of a considerable amount of protein and carbohydrates mainly composed of mannose was found in June 2004, probably reflecting leakage of the intracellular material by an autolysis of the algal cells. The high DOM release rate in the present study suggests that macroalgae would be one of the important DOM producers in coastal regions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Photochemical processes can stimulate or inhibit biological DOM degradation while biological processes often stimulate photochemical degradation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether these 2 degradation processes compete for the same organic substrates or use complementary components in 2 tropical systems with contrasting DOM sources (one dominated by humic, mostly terrigenous DOM and the other dominated by autochthonous phytoplankton production). We performed sequential exposures of DOM from both systems to photochemical or biological degradation. We then measured bacterial growth and respiration and photochemical oxygen consumption in addition to changes in DOM optical properties. In the humic lagoon, photochemical degradation stimulated bacterial degradation up to 500% with little complementary photochemical stimulation by bacterial degradation (an increase of only 13%), In the eutrophic lagoon, we found that photochemical degradation inhibited bacterial degradation 17%, suggesting competition with microbial substrates, while bacterial degradation had no effect on photochemical degradation. The net effect of these eutrophic lagoon interactions was a ca. 2% reduction in dissolved organic carbon degradation. Thus, we conclude that there was net complementary behavior between photochemical and bacterial processes in the humic lagoon in DOM degradation, while we observed little net competitive behavior in the eutrophic lagoon.

Source- and substrate-specific export of dissolved organic matter from permafrost-dominated forested watershed in central Siberia	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Terrestrial and aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) was characterized to trace the likely processes of DOM formation and stream export in a permafrost-dominated watershed in central Siberia. Stream samples were collected in spring (May-June 2003) and summer (July-August 2003) at both low flow and stormflow. Dissolved organic matter was analyzed by pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and identified pyrolysis products were simultaneously analyzed for compound-specific isotope ratios by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Pyrograms of terrestrial and stream DOM contained a similar series of pyrolysis products, suggesting a terrestrial origin for DOM in the small stream draining our study catchment. However, despite the overall similarity of chemical composition of stream DOM at different seasons, we also observed distinct differences in isotopic fingerprint between seasons and hydrologic phases ( stormflow versus low flow). This variation appears to be due to the changing origin of stream DOM from different soil layers and the catchment sources following permafrost thawing during the frost-free period. In general, chemical and isotopic composition of stream DOM was similar to DOM produced in soils of colder north facing slopes ( P < 0.01) with a shallow active layer. South facing slopes with deeper active layers produce little DOM that enters the stream, suggesting that DOM produced in the active layer is retained and stabilized in underlying, unfrozen mineral soils. Climate change that results in additional seasonal thawing of permafrost-dominated landscapes will decrease the amount of DOM exported to riverine systems and change its chemical composition.

Spectral data were then used for the direct determination of nitrate by three-wavelength photometry, which should account for the spectral interference by dissolved organic matter (DOM), and the results compared with nitrate quantification by ion chromatography. The spectrophotometric method proved very suitable for nitrate measurement, with unity slope (mu +/-sigma = 0.99 +/- 0.03) of the correlation plot (spectral vs. ion chromatography data) up to 0.1 mM nitrate, and with r(2) = 0.97 for 26 data points. Lakewater spectra were also used for the characterisation of DOM by means of the specific absorption at 285 and 254 nm (absorbance vs. NPOC, the latter to quantify the DOM amount), and the E-2/E-3 and E-3/E-4 indexes. The latter two make only use of radiation absorption data (250 vs. 365 and 300 vs. 400 nm). It could be concluded that lakewater DOM is mainly composed of autochthonous material (biologically produced aliphatic compounds and only a minor fraction of aromatic groups), with generally low molecular weight and degree of aromaticity. Some exceptions could be found in high-mountain lakes, but it should also be considered that NPOC measurement cannot be avoided if DOM origin is to be studied. From the absorption spectrum alone it is possible to get indication on the aromaticity degree of radiation-absorbing DOM, but most of the autochthonous DOM would escape spectrophotometric characterisation.

J	Akagi, J; Zsolnay, A; Bastida, F				Akagi, Junko; Zsolnay, Adam; Bastida, Felipe			Quantity and spectroscopic properties of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a function of soil sample treatments: Air-drying and pre-incubation	CHEMOSPHERE												The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is essentially defined by the way in which it is obtained. Therefore, we need to understand as to how pre-treatment of a soil will affect the characteristics of DOM, since this fraction may be strongly influenced by a soil's water content. The effect of two different pre-treatments on DOM from the A-horizons of a large variety of ecosystems and regions were compared. In both cases the soils were allowed to air-dry. In one case the air-dried soil was directly extracted (AD), while in the other case it was pre-incubated for I week at 50% of its water holding capacity (INCU). AD is simpler, but INCU brings the soil, and especially its microbial population, back to a standardised state, which is more representative of the Usual state in the field. Both methods are used whenever an adjustment of the soil water content is essential to compare different regions or to eliminate short term weather effects. A significant regression indicated that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) extracted from INCU samples was only 20% of AD DOC. Both the absorptivity (UV absorption divided by DOC) of 86% of the samples, and a fluorescence emission spectrum based Humification Index in all cases increased as a result of pre-incubation. This would indicate that labile compounds released during drying were metabolised during the incubation. However, the magnitude of this increase varied, and no correlation with soil organic and microbial carbon, pH, or texture could be detected. The results show that DOM extracted from AD and INCU soils is not comparable and that the differences are mainly due to the impact of air-drying on the microbial activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hur, J; Jung, NC; Shin, JK				Hur, Jin; Jung, Nahm-Chung; Shin, Jae-Ki			Spectroscopic distribution of dissolved organic matter in a dam reservoir impacted by turbid storm runoff	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Spectroscopic characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a large dam reservoir were determined using ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate spatial distribution of DOM composition after turbid storm runoff. Water samples were collected along a longitudinal axis of the reservoir at three to four depths after a severe storm runoff. Vertical profiles of turbidity data showed that a turbid water layer was located at a middle depth of the entire reservoir. The spectroscopic characteristics of DOM samples in the turbid water layer were similar to those of terrestrial DOM, as demonstrated by the higher specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and the lower fluorescence emission intensity ratio (F (450)/F (500)) compared to other surrounding DOM samples in the reservoir. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that higher content of humic-like DOM composition was contained in the turbid water. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) showed that lower content of protein-like aromatic amino acids was present in the turbid water DOM. The highest protein-like fluorescence was typically observed at a bottom layer of each sampling location. The bottom water DOM exhibited extremely high protein-like florescence near the dam site. The particular observation was attributed to the low water temperature and the isolation of the local bottom water due to the upper location of the withdrawal outlet near the dam. Our results suggest that the distribution of DOM composition in a dam reservoir is strongly influenced by the outflow operation, such as selective withdrawal, as well as terrestrial-origin DOM inputs from storm runoff.																	0167-6369					OCT	2007	133	1-3					53	67		10.1007/s10661-006-9559-0						WOS:000249403900006	17286180

Temperature and soil moisture effects on dissolved organic matter release from a moorland Podzol O horizon under field and controlled laboratory conditions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Organic upland soils store large amounts of humified organic matter. The mechanisms controlling the leaching of this C pool are not completely understood. To examine the effects of temperature and microbial cycling on C leaching, we incubated five unvegetated soil cores from a Podzol O horizon (from NE Scotland), over a simulated natural temperature cycle for 1 year, whilst maintaining a constant soil moisture content. Soil cores were leached with artificial rain (177 mm each, monthly) and the leachates analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and their specific C-normalized UV absorbance determined (SUVA, 285 nm). Monthly values of respiration of the incubated soils were determined as CO2 efflux. To examine the effects of vegetation C inputs and soil moisture, in addition to temperature, we sampled O horizon pore waters in situ and collected five additional field soil cores every month. The field cores were leached under controlled laboratory conditions. Hysteresis in the monthly amount of DOC leached from field cores resulted in greater DOC on the rising, than falling temperature phases. This hysteresis suggested that photosynthetic C stimulated greater DOC losses in early summer, whereas limitations in the availability of soil moisture in late summer suppressed microbial decomposition and DOC loss. Greater DOC concentrations of in-situ pore waters than for any core leachates were attributed to the effects of soil drying and physico-chemical processes in the field. Variation in the respiration rates for the incubated soils was related to temperature, and respiration provided a greater pathway of C loss (44 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than DOC (7.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Changes in SUVA over spring and summer observed in all experimental systems were related to the period of increased temperature. During this time, DOC became less aromatic, which suggests that lower molecular weight labile compounds were not completely mineralized. The ultimate DOC source appears to be the incomplete microbial decomposition of recalcitrant humified C. In warmer periods, any labile C that is not respired is leached, but in autumn either labile C production ceases, or it is sequestered in soil biomass.

Amino acid nitrogen isotopic fractionation patterns as indicators of heterotrophy in plankton, particulate, and dissolved organic matter	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Bulk nitrogen (N) isotope signatures have long been used to investigate organic N source and food web structure in aquatic ine source and processing history in non-living marine organic matter. We measured delta(15) N-AA distributions in plankton tows, sinking particulate organic matter (POM), and ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM) in the central Pacific Ocean. 815 N-AA patterns in eukaryotic algae and mixed plankton tows closely resemble those previously reported in culture. 8 15 N differences between individual amino acids (AA) strongly suggest that the sharply divergent 815 N enrichment for different AA with trophic transfer, as first reported by [McClelland, J.W. and Montoya, J.P. (2002) Trophic relationships and the nitrogen isotopic composition of amino acids. Ecology 83, 2173-2180], is a general phenomenon. In addition, differences in 815 N of individual AA indicative of trophic transfers are clearly preserved in sinking POM, along with additional changes that may indicate subsequent microbial reworking after incorporation into particles. We propose two internally normalized 615 N proxies that track heterotrophic processes in detrital organic matter. Both are based on isotopic signatures in multiple AA, chosen to minimize potential problems associated with any single compound in degraded materials. A trophic level indicator (ATr) is derived from the 815 N difference between selected groups of AA based on their relative enrichment with trophic transfer. We propose that a corresponding measure of the variance within a subgroup of AA (designated F, P) may indicate total AA resynthesis, and be strongly tied to heterotrophic microbial reworking in detrital materials. Together, we hypothesize that ATr and E V define a two dimensional trophic "space", which may simultaneously express relative extent of eukaryotic and bacterial heterotrophic processing. In the equatorial Pacific, ATr indicates an average of 1.5-2 trophic transfers between phytoplankton and sinking POM at all depths and locations. The E V parameter suggests that substantial variation may exist in bacterial heterotrophic processing between differing regions and time periods. In dissolved material 615 N-AA patterns appear unrelated to those in POM. In contrast to POM, 615 N-AA signatures in UDOM show no clear changes with depth, and suggest that dissolved AA preserved throughout the oceanic water column have undergone few, if any, trophic transfers. Together these data suggest a sharp divide between processing histories, and possibly sources, of particulate vs. dissolved AA. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A strong inverse correlation between the decrease in fluorescence upon Cu addition and CDOM abundance suggests the presence of excess binding sites for Cu in high CDOM samples. Electroanalytical studies indicate that CDOM extracted from C-18 cartridges formed Cu complexes with concentrations and conditional stability constants similar to ligands found in ambient rainwater. When authentic rainwater samples were photolyzed with simulated sunlight both photoproduction and photodestruction of ligands were observed, suggesting the photochemical response of Cu-complexing ligands in rainwater is the result of two competing reactions. The rate of CDOM photobleaching was directly related to changes in strong ligands (K-CuL similar to 10(15)) whereas weaker ligands (K-CuL < 10(13)) were not correlated, suggesting the photolabile CDOM resides in the strong ligand class. A photolysis study comparing filtered and unfiltered rainwater samples indicated that Cu-complexing ligands adsorbed onto or otherwise associated with particles are photodegraded much more rapidly than dissolved ligands. Photolysis with UV radiation appears to be most effective at engendering changes in Cu ligands, however a significant photochemical response was also observed when samples were exposed to photosynthetically active radiation with wavelengths greater than 400 nm. Results from this study demonstrate that complexation of Cu by CDOM has important ramifications for controlling both the speciation of the metal and the reactivity of CDOM in rainwater.

It could affect the color of the waters. It is necessary to study it during in research on ecosystem, remote sensing of the water color and the cycle of carbon in waters. CDOM can fluoresce when excited, so fluorescence spectrum has been used to study its origin, distribution, and change. In the present article the fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to study the relation between the fluorescence intensity, Spectrum area and the concentration of CDOM When the concentration of CDOM is low(less than 75 mg center dot L-1), there is a better linear relationship(r(2)>0.98) between the fluorescence intensity, the spectrum area and the concentration of CDOM. Meanwhile good linear relations were found between the fluorescence intensity and spectrum area, which showed the same changeable trend of the fluorescence intensity and spectrum area with the concentration change of CDOM. A method was established to quantify the concentration of CDOM in water from different source using the linear relationship between the spectrum area and the concentration. It suits the complicated constituent analysis of CDOM and could really and accurately show the concentration of CDOM in natural water.																	1000-0593					OCT	2007	27	10					2083	2087								WOS:000250794700043

(Mei)			Characterization of dissolved organic matter in drinking water sources impacted by multiple tributaries	WATER RESEARCH												The characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in drinking water sources is important as this material contributes to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) and affects how water treatment unit operations are optimized. Drinking water utilities often draw water from sources impacted by multiple tributaries, with possible shifts in DOM concentrations and reactivity over time, depending on specific environmental conditions. In this study, results are presented on the characterization of DOM under varying ambient conditions from the four main tributaries of Lake Mead, a large reservoir in the southwest United States. The tributaries include the Las Vegas Wash (LM), Muddy River (MR), Virgin River (VR) and the upper Colorado River (UCR). One additional sample was collected at the outflow of the reservoir (lower Colorado River (LCR)). The DOM was characterized by both bulk parameters (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA)) and specific physicochemical properties, i.e. size, polarity and fluorescence. The analyses were performed emphasizing limited changes in its natural configuration by eliminating analytical preparation steps, excluding sample filtration (0.45 mu m filter). Results indicate that each tributary had a different molecular weight distribution, as well as fluorescence properties, which helped in the identification of the relative source of DOM (allochthonous versus autochthonous). The largest apparent molecular weight distribution was observed for DOM samples collected at the MR site, which is fed mostly by groundwater seepage. The smallest apparent molecular weight was observed for DOM collected at the LCR site, suggesting that retention in the reservoir resulted in a decrease in molecular weight as a probable result of photo oxidation and microbial processes. Fluorescence analysis aided the differentiation of DOM by clearly identifying waters that were affected by microbial activity (LVW, UCR, and LCR), either by wastewater influence or by autochthonous processes, versus limited microbial influence (MR and VR). Polarity analysis revealed clear differences in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature between waters, including temporal differences within individual waters at a particular site. The DOM from the LVW and VR sites had higher hydrophobic character, as measured by retention onto non-polar sorbents. Additionally, the DOM collected at the LCR had the least hydrophobic character. This type of analysis would be beneficial to utilities who want to better understand and manage their source waters, especially in the evaluation of temporal variation within a watershed.

J	Tan, YR; Kilduff, JE				Tan, Yongrui; Kilduff, James E.			Factors affecting selectivity during dissolved organic matter removal by anion-exchange resins	WATER RESEARCH												Anion-exchange processes have received increased attention in recent years as efficient alternatives for removing disinfection byproduct precursors. in this research the preferential uptake of different dissolved organic matter (DOM) components, and hence the resulting reactivity after treatment, is shown to depend on the initial molecular weight (MW) distribution and the sulfate concentration. MW distribution is important because size-exclusion phenomena can occur in ion-exchange sorption, leading to the preferential uptake of low (ca. 1000 Da) MW species. Sulfate competition an reverse resin preference for low-MW species. DOM components that compete best with sulfate combine ionogenic group affinity and entropy-assisted adsorption. Entropy-assisted sorption, whereby sorption is promoted by the entropy gained from the desolvation of hydrophobic DOM moieties, is shown to be significant for two surface water sources. Entropic contributions are most significant when resin dosages are low and competition between DOM components and between DOM and sulfate are high. DOM components having MW near 1 kDa are sufficiently large to have significant hydrophobic moieties to promote entropyassisted sorption and sufficiently small to enable access to exchange sites. Total uptake and preferential removal of specific UV absorbance (SUVA), an indicator of DOM reactivity, will thus depend on the initial MW distribution, how SUVA depends on MW, and the sulfate concentration.

DOM samples were divided into hydrophobic acid, base, neutral (Hpo-A, Hpo-B, Hpo-N) and hydrophilic (Hpi) fractions using the fractionation method employing DAX-8 resin. Hpi was the smallest fraction of all the raw leachate samples. The proportion of Hpo-N increased with increasing operating time. Landfill sites containing abundant non-combustible wastes showed a higher proportion of Hpo-B than Hpo-A. The molecular weights and functional groups of the DOM fractions were studied by using gel permeation chromatography and FTIR, respectively. In addition, the fluorescent properties and binding sites of the DOM fractions were investigated using fluorescence analysis. In the synchronous scan spectra of each DOM fraction, most of DOM fractions showed an emission peak for the main fluorophores at around 300 run or 350 nm, which are regarded as aromatic amino acid-like fluorophores. The interaction between the DOM fraction and the pollutants (Cu2+, pyrene. and phenanthrene) was investigated using the fluorescence quenching method. It was observed that the aromatic amino acid-like fluorophores in the DOM fractions could be an important factor affecting complexation with the pollutants. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, batch experiments with granular activated carbon (GAC) have been carried out at three temperatures (5 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 35 degrees C) using a humic acid model water and different types of surface water (lake, river, canal). Furthermore, the adsorption of an anthropogenic contaminant, atrazine, was quantified in the absence and presence of DOM. The results indicate a significant influence of water temperature on the adsorption equilibrium of DOM and atrazine. Contrary to expectations, DOM and atrazine adsorption in surface water tends to be increased with increasing water temperature, whereas the extent of this effect is dependent on the type and concentration of DOM. Furthermore, the temperature effect on atrazine adsorption is controlled by competition of DOM and atrazine on adsorption sites. Some assumptions are proposed and discussed for explaining the temperature effects observed in the batch studies.																	0013-936X					SEP 15	2007	41	18					6448	6453		10.1021/es070704+						WOS:000249500700027	17948792

Combining reverse osmosis and electrodialysis for more complete recovery of dissolved organic matter from seawater	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the oceans is one of the largest dynamic carbon reservoirs on earth. The composition and fate of this carbon reservoir is of great interest to earth scientists, atmospheric scientists, and biologists who study global biogeochemical cycles and global warming. Current techniques for the extraction and purification of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from seawater for research purposes recover at best only 30 wt% of DOC. A new technique for the recovery of DOM from seawater has been developed by combining electrodialysis and reverse osmosis. Here we present shipboard results and laboratory work to show the feasibility of our technique. DOC recoveries exceeding 60% and even exceeding 90% for one seawater sample have been found. Analysis of samples recovered using this technique will yield new insights into the cycling of DOC in the oceans. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A statistical analysis of the original multidimensional TMAH and TMAAc pyrograms disclosed that the overall structural compositions of the five most important size fractions, accounting for 84% of the original DOM, greatly resembled each other. The remaining three minor size fractions were not classified as homogeneous associations, but they also contained the same total, covalently bound and free carboxylic acid species as the other size fractions and the original DOM mixture, thus representing some kind of intermediate forms. This fundamental outcome strongly supports the opinion that the native dissolved humic-like macromolecules resemble supramolecular associations of smaller molecular size moieties with similar structural functionalities. The concentrations of free aliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids in the DOM solution were so low that their effects on the potential formation of multiply charged ions in electrospray ionization-MS (ESI-MS) studies are likely insignificant.

Reduction in dissolved organic carbon ( DOC), absorbance of ultraviolet light at 254 nm ( UV-254), biodegradable dissolved organic carbon ( BDOC) and nonbiodegradable dissolved organic carbon ( NBDOC) for the bulk DOM averaged 72.35%, 53.98%, 97.49% and 35.33% across the soil columns, respectively. Using XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins, DOM was fractionated into 3 fractions: hydrophobic acid ( HPO-A), transphilic acid ( TPI-A) and hydrophilic fraction ( HPI). HPO-A was removed by 61.06%, TPI-A by 54.86% and HPI by 74.95% as DOC as a consequence of the laboratory-scale SAT, respectively. The reduction of THMFP from HPO-A, TPI-A and HPI was 27.24%, 26.24% and 36.08%, respectively. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( H-1-NMR) spectra revealed that the HPO-A isolated from the secondary effluent contained more aromatic functional groups than the corresponding TPI-A. Fourier-transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectrum analysis illustrated that TPI-A had decreased hydrocarbon and increased aromatics content in the SAT columns. Specific ultraviolet light absorbance ( SUVA) and specific THMFP for each DOM fraction increased across the soil columns and HPI exhibited greater increase in both than HPO-A and TPI-A. The most problematic THM precursor was found to be HPO-A with its high quantity present in recharged water and high chlorine reactivity.																	1001-6538					SEP	2007	52	18					2496	2505		10.1007/s11434-007-0339-1						WOS:000249915500008

Distribution, characteristics and potential impacts of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Hudson Strait and Hudson Bay, Canada	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were studied in Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait in the Canadian Arctic. Hudson Bay receives a disproportionately large influx of river runoff. With high dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations in Arctic rivers the influence of CDOM on coastal and ocean systems can be significant, yet the distribution, characteristics and potential consequences of CDOM in these waters remain unknown. We collected 470 discrete water samples in offshore, coastal, estuarine and river waters in the region during September and October 2005. Mixing of CDOM appeared conservative with salinity, although regional differences exist due to variable DOM composition in the rivers discharging to the Bay and the presence of sea-ice melt, which has low CDOM concentrations and low salinity. There were higher concentrations of CDOM in Hudson Bay, especially in coastal waters with salinities < 28, due to river runoff. Using CDOM composition of water masses as a tracer for the freshwater components revealed that river runoff is largely constrained to nearshore waters in Hudson Bay, while sea-ice melt is distributed more evenly in the Bay. Strong inshore-offshore gradients in the bio-optical properties of the surface waters in the Hudson Bay cause large variation in penetration of ultraviolet radiation and the photic depth within the bay, potentially controlling the vertical distribution of biomass and occurrence of deep chlorophyll maxima which are prevalent only in the more transparent offshore waters of the bay. The CDOM distribution and associated photoprocesses may influence the thermodynamics and stratification of the coastal waters, through trapping of radiant heating within the top few meters of the water column. Photoproduction of biologically labile substrates from CDOM could potentially stimulate the growth of biomass in Hudson Bay coastal waters. Further studies are needed to investigate the importance of terrestrial DOM in the Hudson Bay region, and the impact of hydroelectric development and climate change on these processes.

J	Perez, MT; Sommaruga, R				Perez, Maria Teresa; Sommaruga, Ruben			Interactive effects of solar radiation and dissolved organic matter on bacterial activity and community structure	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We studied the interactive effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and solar radiation on the activity and community structure of bacteria from an alpine lake. Activity was assessed both at the community level as leucine incorporation rates and at the single-cell level by microautoradiography. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and signal amplification by catalysed reporter deposition (CARD-FISH) was used to track changes in the bacterial community composition. Bacteria-free filtrates of different DOM sources (lake, algae or soil) were incubated either in the dark or exposed to solar radiation. Afterwards, the natural bacterial assemblage was inoculated and the cultures incubated in the dark for 24-48 h. Bacterial activity was enhanced in the first 24 h in the soil and algal DOM amendments kept in the dark. After 48 h, the enhancement effect was greatly reduced. The initial bacterial community was dominated by Betaproteobacteria followed by Actinobacteria. The relative abundance (expressed as a percentage of DAPI-stained cells) of Betaproteobacteria increased first in dark incubated DOM amendments, but after 48 h no significant differences were detected among treatments. In contrast, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased in pre-irradiated DOM treatments. Although Betaproteobacteria dominated at the end of the experiment, the relative abundance of their R-BT subgroup differed among treatments. Changes in bacterial community activity were significantly correlated with those of the relative abundance and activity of Betaproteobacteria, whereas the contribution of Actinobacteria to the bulk activity was very modest. Our results indicate a negative effect of DOM photoalteration on the bulk bacterial activity. The magnitude of this effect was time-dependent and related to rapid changes in the bacterial assemblage composition.

However, little is known about the diversity of C23O genes in unpolluted environments. In such environments, various factors, including the quality and quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM), could influence the composition and behaviour of bacterial community possessing C230 genes. We investigated C23O genes in bacteria responding to DOM from various sources in a eutrophic lake by PCR and cloning. Six microcosms filled with lake water containing indigenous bacteria and DOM from different sources were incubated for 10 days. After 1 or 2 days of incubation, C23O genes were detected in the microcosms enriched with DOM recovered from inflow river water and humus from reed grass. The sequences were very diverse but had features conserved in extradiol dioxygenases. The clone libraries generated on day 2 showed distinctive compositions among microcosms, indicating that bacteria possessing a variety of C23O genes responded differently to DOM from different sources. After 10 days of incubation, C23O genes in a previously unidentified gene cluster, 'Cluster X', became dominant in the libraries.																	0168-6496					SEP	2007	61	3					449	458		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00347.x						WOS:000248961900006	17645532

Carbohydrates in size fractionated dissolved organic matter in a station of the Bay of Bengal	INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES												Seawater samples were collected from 4 depths (2, 100, 500 and 1000 m) at one station in the Bay of Bengal. Very high molecular weight (VHMW) (>30 kDa to 0.2 mu m) and high molecular weight (HMW) (10 to 30 kDa) fractions of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) were collected using Amicon stirred Ultrafiltration Cell, and analysed for dissolved organic carbon (UDOC), total carbohydrates (UTCHO) and neutral sugars (UNS). UDOC concentrations were relatively higher in HMW fraction whereas, UTCHO and UNS were relatively enriched in VHMW fraction. Concentrations of UDOC, UTCHO and UNS generally decreased with increasing water depth. The UNS-C accounted for 2.2 to 6.2% of UDOC and generally decreased with depth. The observed decrease suggests utilization by in situ heterotrophic organisms. Monosaccharide composition data suggest that rhamnose, fucose and galactose were relatively more abundant in VHMW fraction, as well as glucose in HMW fraction. The weight percentage fractions of most of the monosaccharides of both VHMW and HMW did not show consistent decrease with depth. The yields and concentrations of UNS indicated a size-related diagentic sequence where VHMW represents the most reactive fraction.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				SEP	2007	36	3					193	198								WOS:000250395900003

Photodegradation of dissolved organic matter in forested streams of the northern Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, and it influences a range of physical, chemical, and biological properties. Reactions induced by solar radiation may oxidize DOM to inorganic C or break large molecules into smaller ones. Therefore, photodegradable DOM is removed with exposure to light, and the remaining DOM pool might become less photodegradable as photorecalcitrant DOM accumulates. This possibility has led to speculation that previous light exposure might influence the susceptibility of DOM to photodegradation and that forested low-light streams might have highly photodegradable DOM. To assess this possibility we measured: 1) the susceptibility of stream DOM to photoreactions and compared our results to studies in other aquatic ecosystems, 2) the relative importance of the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the solar spectrum to DOM photoreactions, and 3) the photoreactivity of DOM collected from streams with and without upstream lakes. We measured DOM properties of stream water exposed for similar to 56 h to 1 of 3 treatments: full sunlight, sunlight with the UV portion of the spectrum (< 400 nm) removed, and a dark control. Exposure to light reduced the UV light-absorbing ability of DOM and, to a lesser extent, its concentration. Most alterations of DOM properties could be attributed to the UV portion of the solar spectrum. We found no evidence that previous light exposure significantly influenced photodegradability of stream DOM. Our results suggest that other DOM-processing agents, such as heterotrophic uptake, can obscure the effect of upstream photoexposure on downstream DOM photodegradability.																	0887-3593					SEP	2007	26	3					416	425		10.1899/06-097.1						WOS:000248351600005

Salinity, temperature, fecal coliform, absorbance (200-700 nm) and fluorescence (lambda(excitation) = 350 nm; lambda(emission) = 360-650 nm) were measured in the creek and surf-zone during a dry and rain event. Fluorescence to absorption ratios for CDOM were used to distinguish water masses, with two distinct CDOM end-members identified as creek (flu/abs = 8.7 +/- 0.8 x 10(4)) and coastal (flu/abs = 2.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(4)). Waters containing the same CDOM end-member had highly variable bacterial levels during the dry event, suggesting intermittent sources of bacteria added to a uniform water source, consistent with marine birds. During the rain event, increased levels of the creek end-member and bacteria indicated a second bacteria source from runoff. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The study areas include central Bay area, receptor areas of Dagu River, Licun River and Haibo River. The aim was to investigate the influence of discharges from several typical rivers to the receiving seawater. Dagu River discharges mostly freshwater, while the other two rivers discharges include more wastewaters from factories and sewages treatments. The results indicate that,there is a redshift of the position of humic-like fluorescence peaks due to the discharges from sewages and wastewaters from factories. The intensities of protein-like and humic-like peaks were the strongest in the samples from area near Haibo River and Licun River, while the weakest fluorescence intensities of both protein-like and humic-like were observed in the samples collected from central bay area. This suggests that river inputs are the mains sources of DOM in seawater of Jiaozhou Bay, while DOM produced by bioactivity in situ dominates those in central Bay area. The relationships of protein-like and humic-like fluorescence intensities vary depending on the water samples. The DOM in seawater of Jiaozhou Bay may be polluted by protein-like organic matter produced by human activity, as indicated by higher ratios of protein-like and humic-like fluorescence intensities. The results suggest the potential utility of EEMs technique for trace DOM and land-based pollution sources.

G.; Yoshioka, Takahito; Konohira, Eiichi; Tanoue, Eiichiro			Dynamics and characteristics of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the groundwater, river and lake water	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Fluorescent dissolved organic matters ( FDOM) in the groundwater-river-lake environments were investigated using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix ( EEM) and measuring the dissolved organic carbon ( DOC), inorganic anions and electric conductivity ( EC) in shallow groundwater, river and lake waters. DOC concentrations were high and largely varied in groundwater, 16 - 328 mu M C ( mean 109 +/- 88 mu M C), and in river waters, 43 - 271 mu M C mean 158 +/- 62 mu M C) and were very low in the lake Biwa waters, 89 - 97 mu M C ( mean 93 +/- 2 mu M C). The fluorescence properties of EEM showed that the fulvic-like components ( peak C, peak A and peak M) were dominated in groundwater and river waters, but protein-like components ( peak T) was in lake waters. The peak C was observed at Ex/Em 320 +/- 9/424 +/- 5 nm in groundwater, and 340 +/- 5/ 432 +/- 4 nm in river waters, but the lake waters detected the two peaks, 347 +/- 7/441 +/- 11 nm ( peak C) as a minor peak and 304 +/- 2/421 +/- 8 nm ( peak M) as a major peak. Emission wavelength of peak T was observed to shorten in wavelengths from groundwater to river and then lake waters. Peak T in lake waters showed at shorter in wavelengths ( 279 +/- 2/338 +/- 11 nm) at the middle point of Lake Biwa compared to those of lake shore site ( 283 +/- 3/350 +/- 7 nm). Photoirradiation experiment on upstream waters suggested the changes in the fluorescence peaks of fulvic acid-like substances in lake waters, which might be caused by photo-degradation. DOC concentration was significantly correlated with inorganic anions and EC in river waters. However, such correlations were not observed in groundwater. Anion concentrations in lake waters were low with respect to DOC concentration. These results showed that the optical and chemical properties of FDOM are characteristically varied among groundwater, river and lake waters, indicating the impacts of environments to various FDOM at the same watershed level.																	0049-6979					SEP	2007	184	1-4					157	176		10.1007/s11270-007-9405-1						WOS:000249010500011

Impact of circulation on export production, dissolved organic matter, and dissolved oxygen in the ocean: Results from Phase II of the Ocean Carbon-cycle Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP-2)	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Results are presented of export production, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dissolved oxygen simulated by 12 global ocean models participating in the second phase of the Ocean Carbon-cycle Model Intercomparison Project. A common, simple biogeochemical model is utilized in different coarse-resolution ocean circulation models. The model mean (+/- 1 sigma) downward flux of organic matter across 75 m depth is 17 +/- 6 Pg C yr(-1). Model means of globally averaged particle export, the fraction of total export in dissolved form, surface semilabile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and seasonal net outgassing (SNO) of oxygen are in good agreement with observation-based estimates, but particle export and surface DOC are too high in the tropics. There is a high sensitivity of the results to circulation, as evidenced by (1) the correlation of surface DOC and export with circulation metrics, including chlorofluorocarbon inventory and deep-ocean radiocarbon, (2) very large intermodel differences in Southern Ocean export, and (3) greater export production, fraction of export as DOM, and SNO in models with explicit mixed layer physics. However, deep-ocean oxygen, which varies widely among the models, is poorly correlated with other model indices. Cross-model means of several biogeochemical metrics show better agreement with observation-based estimates when restricted to those models that best simulate deep-ocean radiocarbon. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of physical processes in marine biogeochemical modeling and suggest that the development of circulation models can be accelerated by evaluating them with marine biogeochemical metrics.

A critical review of three methods used for the measurement of mercury (Hg2+)-dissolved organic matter stability constants	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					15th Annual V M Goldschmidt Conference	MAY, 2005	Moscow, ID					Three experimental techniques-ion exchange, liquid-liquid extraction with competitive ligand exchange, and solid-phase extraction with competitive ligand exchange (CLE-SPE) - were evaluated as methods for determining conditional stability constants (K) for the binding of mercury (Hg2+) to dissolved organic matter (DOM). To determine the utility of a given method to measure stability constants at environmentally relevant experimental conditions, experimental results should meet three criteria: (1) the data must be experimentally valid, in that they were acquired under conditions that meet all the requirements of the experimental method, (2) the Hg:DOM ratio should be determined and it should fall within levels that are consistent with environmental conditions, and (3) the stability constants must fall within the detection window of the method. The ion exchange method was found to be limited by its detection window, which constrains the method to stability constants with logK values less than about 14. The liquid-liquid extraction method was found to be complicated by the ability of Hg-DOM complexes to partition into the organic phase. The CLE-SPE method was found to be the most suitable of these methods for the measurement of Hg-DOM stability constants. Stability constants for DOM isolates measured using the CLE-SPE method at environmentally relevant Hg:DOM ratios were logK= 25-30 (M-1). These values are consistent with the strong Hg2+ binding expected for reduced S-containing binding sites. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three major fluorophores, two humic-like and one protein-like fluorescence, were observed in most of the DOM samples. Significant correlations were observed between the humic-like and protein-like fluorescence intensities, as well as, between them and other water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon, PO43- chemical oxygen demand and NH4+ concentrations, suggesting that agricultural and municipal wastewaters may be the source for both protein-like and humic-like fluorescence materials in the river. The fluorescence quenching titration resulted in similar values for the conditional stability constants for Hg(H) complexes with the humic-like and protein-like fluorophores, likely due to the dominance of Hg binding with O-containing function groups at the high Hg(II) concentrations used in the titration. Effects of Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cu2+ ions on the binding between Hg(II) and three different fluorophores were also studied. The fluorescence index from the Nanming River was further found to be controlled by pH and Hg(II), cautioning its use in discriminating the sources of DOM. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Polubesova, T; Sherman-Nakache, M; Chefetz, B				Polubesova, Tamara; Sherman-Nakache, Michal; Chefetz, Benny			Binding of pyrene to hydrophobic fractions of dissolved organic matter: Effect of polyvalent metal complexation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The effects of polyvalent metal cations on pyrene binding to hydrophobic acid and neutral fractions (HoA and HoN, respectively) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were elucidated. The DOM was isolated from sewage sludge; pyrene binding was estimated from fluorescence measurements. Isotherms of pyrene binding to both fractions were nonlinear. Pyrene binding was higher for HoN due to the combined effect of greater hydrophobicity, aromaticity and the large molecular size of this fraction relative to HoA. The complexation of HoA with Cu(2+), Al(3+), and Fe(3+) increased the binding of pyrene only when the HoA was equilibrated with polyvalent cations before pyrene was added. The maximal increase in pyrene binding to HoA was 56%, 64%, and 118% when pre-equilibrated with Cu(2+), Fe(3+), and Al(3+), respectively. Pyrene binding to HoN was not affected by the presence of metal cations. HoA complexation with metal cations increased the apparent molecular size of this fraction. We suggest that the presence of metal cations induces the formation of pseudomicelles, which are more efficient in binding pyrene than the low-molecular-weight components. Our results demonstrate that HoA and HoN components can significantly affect the transport of organic contaminants in soils irrigated with treated wastewater or amended with sewage sludge.																	0013-936X					AUG 1	2007	41	15					5389	5394		10.1021/es070722r						WOS:000248343600031	17822107

Particulate products and new polymers for a more efficient removal of dissolved organic matter in drinking water resources	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												More restricting legislation on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), especially when applied to waters with high DOC contents and low turbidity, urges the drinking water industry to improve the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM). jar tests were carried out on sand-filtered water (SFW) and raw water (RW), with respectively 50 different particulate compounds and different cationic polymers. Analytical measurements of DOC and UV absorbance at 254 nm, as well as a characterisation by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), were performed in order to determine the efficiency of the process. Experiments on SFW showed that activated carbon was the only compound able to remove efficiently the residual DOC remaining after conventional treatments (up to 40% of reduction). Other trials on RW using mixes of ferric chloride (FeCl3,) and cationic polymers (polyamines and polyDADMAC) pointed out that the molecular mass and the reticulation ratios have a significant influence on the efficiency of the treatment. Finally, the addition of activated carbons to the previous reagents significantly improved the observed removal efficiencies by similar amounts.																	0959-3330					AUG	2007	28	8					861	869		10.1080/09593332808618850						WOS:000248737200004	17879845

DOC removal (i.e. non-conservative) was common to both estuaries at low salinities, but DOC addition also occurred in the Tyne at higher salinities due to inputs from a large sewage treatment works and polluted urban rivers. DOC in freshwater endmembers was in the range 608.1-2326.5 mu M (mean 1229.6 mu M, n = 7) for the Tyne and was 226.1 and 668.2 mu M on two occasions in the Tweed; the high DOC concentrations reflecting the peatland nature of the catchments and high river discharge. DOC removal in the Tyne estuary was in the range 0-58% (n = 7) (one transect exhibits 0% removal as pollution sources of DOC dominate medium to high salinity samples so it was not possible to extrapolate a conservative mixing line back to low salinities). Highest percent removals were at highest river flows and correspondingly high turbidity and DOC concentrations in the Tyne estuary. In contrast, DOC removal in the Tweed estuary was consistently 6% (n = 2), and appeared independent of river flow, turbidity and DOC concentration on the two transects conducted. Both estuaries exhibited a strong correlation between the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350)) and DOC which was seasonally robust; Tweed (r(2) = 0.98, p < 0.001, n = 20), Tyne (r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.001, n = 87) and Tyne without potentially anthropogenic or sedimentary derived DOM source samples (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.001, n = 74). The robust nature of these relationships implies that remotely sensed CDOM characteristics have the potential to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of estuarine DOC. This study highlights the variation in estuarine removal of peatland derived DOC between the two estuaries and in the Tyne estuary it shows how differences in river regime can result in significant changes in DOC removal at low salinities. Our findings demonstrate the need to conduct DOM sampling under varying seasons and hydrological regimes to accurately quantify the removal of terrigenous DOM in estuaries and its subsequent flux to the oceans.

J	Heitmann, T; Goldhammer, T; Beer, J; Blodau, C				Heitmann, Tobias; Goldhammer, Tobias; Beer, Julia; Blodau, Christian			Electron transfer of dissolved organic matter and its potential significance for anaerobic respiration in a northern bog	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We investigated electron transfer processes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and their potential importance for anaerobic heterotrophic respiration in a northern peatland. Electron accepting and donating capacities (EAC, EDC) of DOM were quantified using dissolved H(2)S and ferric iron as reactants. Carbon turnover rates were obtained from porewater profiles (CO(2), CH(4)) and inverse modeling. Carbon dioxide was released at rates of 0.2-5.9 mmol m(-2) day(-1) below the water table. Methane (CH(4)) formation contributed < 10%, and oxygen consumption 2% to 40%, leaving a major fraction of CO(2) production unexplained. DOM oxidized H(2)S to thiosulfate and was reduced by dissolved ferric iron. Reduction with H(2)S increased the subsequently determined EDC compared to untreated controls, indicating a reversibility of the electron transfer. In situ redox capacities of DOM ranged from 0.2 to 6.1 mEq g(-1) C (EAC) and from 0.0 to 1.4 mEq g(-1) C (EDC), respectively. EAC generally decreased with depth and changed after a water table drawdown and rebound by 20 and -45 mEq m(-2), respectively. The change in EAC during the water table fluctuation was similar to CH(4) formation rates. In peatlands, electron transfer of DOM may thus significantly contribute to the oxidation of reduced organic substrates by anaerobic heterotrophic respiration, or by maintaining the respiratory activity of sulfate reducers via provision of thiosulfate. Part of the anaerobic electron flow in peat soils is thus potentially diverted from methanogenesis, decreasing its contribution to the total carbon emitted to the atmosphere.

J	Yamashita, Y; Tsukasaki, A; Nishida, T; Tanoue, E				Yamashita, Youhei; Tsukasaki, Ayumi; Nishida, Tamihito; Tanoue, Eiichiro			Vertical and horizontal distribution of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the Southern Ocean	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The vertical and horizontal distribution of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), determined by fluorescence intensity at 320 nm excitation and 420 nm emission, were clarified in nine stations on two transects at the Southern Ocean, including a subtropical, subantarctic, polar frontal and Antarctic zone. All vertical profiles of fluorescence intensity showed that levels were lowest in the surface waters, increased with increasing the depth in mid-depth waters (similar to 2000 m), and then stayed within a relatively narrow range from there to the bottom. Such vertical profiles of FDOM were similar to those of nutrients, but were adverse to dissolved oxygen. In water columns below the temperature-minimum subsurface water (dichothermal waters) in the Antarctic zone and below the winter mixed layer in the other zones, we determined the relationships of fluorescence intensity to concentrations of nutrients and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) over the entire area of the present study, and found significant linear correlations between the levels of fluorescence intensity and nutrient concentrations (r= 0.70 and 0.71 for phosphate and nitrate + nitrite, respectively) and AOU (r= 0.91). From the strong correlation coefficient between fluorescence intensity and AOU, we concluded that FDOM in the Southern Ocean is formed in situ via the biological oxidation of organic matter. The regeneration of the nutrients/consumption of the oxygen/formation of FDOM was active in mid-depth waters. However, the correlations between fluorescence intensities and nutrients and AOU were different in the mid-depth water masses, Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), indicating that the sources of organic matter responsible for FDOM formation were different. A considerable amount of FDOM in the SAMW is thought to be produced by the remineralization of DOM in addition to sinking particulate organic matter, while DOM is less responsible for FDOM formation in the AAIW.

J	Cumberland, SA; Baker, A				Cumberland, Susan A.; Baker, Andy			The freshwater dissolved organic matter fluorescence-total organic carbon relationship	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) enable comparisons of humic-like (H-L) and fulvic-like (F-L) fluorescence intensities with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic systems. The fluorescence-DOC relationship differed in gradient, i.e. the fluorescence per gram of carbon, and in the strength of the correlation coefficient. We compare the fluorescence intensity of the F-L and H-L fractions and DOC of freshwater DOM in north Shropshire, England, featuring a river, wetland, spring, pond and sewage DOM sources. Correlations between fluorescence and DOC varied between sample sites. Wetland water samples for the F-L peak gave the best correlation, r = 0.756; the lowest correlation was from final treated sewage effluent, r = 0.167. The relationship between fluorescence and DOC of commercially available International Humic Substances Society standards were also examined and they generally showed a lower fluorescence per gram of carbon for the F-L peak than the natural samples, whereas peat wetland DOM gave a greater fluorescence per gram of carbon than river DOM. Here, we propose the strength of the fluorescence-DOC correlation to be a useful tool when discriminating sources of DOM in fresh water. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the concentration profiles of soil-borne DOC, Cu and Zn at various irrigation rates with synthetic rain water under quasi steady-state conditions, using repacked soil columns with a metal-polluted topsoil and two unpolluted subsoils. Soil solution was collected using suction cups installed at centimeter intervals over depth. In the topsoil the concentrations of DOC, dissolved metals (Zn and Cu), major cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and anions (NO3- and SO42-) increased with depth. In the subsoil, the Cu and Zn concentrations dropped to background levels within 2 cm. All compounds were much faster mobilized in the first 4 cm than in the rest of the topsoil. DOC and Cu concentrations were higher at higher flow rates for a given depth, whereas the concentrations of the other ions decreased with increasing flow rate. The decomposition of soil organic matter resulted in the formation of DOC, SO42-, and NO3- and was the main driver of the system. Regression analysis indicated that Cu mobilization was governed by DOC, whereas Zn mobilization was primarily determined by Ca and to a lesser extent by DOC. Labile Zn and Cu2+ concentrations were well predicted by the NICA-Donnan model. The results highlight the value of high-resolution in-situ measurements of DOC and metal mobilization in soil profiles.

MCR of the quenching of the EEM of fluorescence of dissolved organic matter by metal ions	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA					10th International Conference on Chemometrics in Analytical Chemistry	SEP 10-15, 2006	Aguas de Lindoia, BRAZIL					The quenching of the fluorescence of excitation emission matrices (EEM) of two samples of dissolved organic matter (DOM) [fulvic acid from a dam water (FA) and a commercial humic acid (HA)], provoked by the metal ions Cu(II), UO22+, Fe(III) and Hg(II), was studied by principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). PCA of the individual EEM, sets of EEM and the sequential analysis of EEM allows the determination of the number of components that provoke linearly independent variations in the EEM and to assess the trend and stability of the quenching process. Four and three components were detected in the EEM of FA and HA, respectively. Some of these components show quenching in the presence of the studied metal ions and other are not affected. Also, the occurrence of scattering due to hydrolysis of metal ions is detected in the PCA sequential analysis of EEM as function of the metal ion concentration. Excitation and emission spectra and quenching profiles were extracted from EEM using MCR-ALS with non-negativity constraints. Stability constants between FA and HA with the studied metal ions were estimated by a modified Stern-Volmer equation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To isolate DOM, crushed rock material was extracted under anoxic conditions with deionized water, 0.1 M NaOH and synthetic pore water (SPW, water containing all major ions at pore water concentrations but no organic matter), respectively. The effects of extraction parameters on the extracted DOM including the solid-to-liquid ratio, extraction time, exposure to O-2 and acid pretreatment of the rock material prior to the anoxic extraction were evaluated. In addition, DOM in one of the first pore water samples collected in the underground rock laboratory at Bure (France) was characterized for comparison. The size distribution and the low molecular weight organic acid contents of the extracts and pore water DOM were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with an organic C detector (LC-OCD) and by ion chromatography. The results revealed that only a fraction of less than 1.2% of the total organic C present in the rock was extractable. Maximum dissolved organic C (DOC) concentrations in the anoxic extracts ranged from 5.5 +/- 0.3 mg/L for SPW extracts to 14.2 +/- 1.1 mg/L for 0.1 M NaOH extracts. The major portion of the DOC in the anoxic extracts consisted of hydrophilic compounds (48-78%) having a molecular weight of less than 500 Da. Up to 21% of DOC in the anoxic extracts was identified as acetate, formate, lactate and malate. The short-term exposure of rock material to O-2 during rock crushing strongly increased DOC concentrations and led to a shift towards smaller molecular weight compounds and to a higher low molecular weight organic acid (LMWOA) content as compared to the strictly anoxic extraction. The pore water sampled from a packed-off borehole exhibited a higher DOC concentration (56.7 mg/L) than the rock extracts. The pore water DOM was almost exclusively composed of acetate and propionate (88% of the DOC). The predominance of LMWOA in the pore water compared to the anoxic extracts may arise from the heterogeneity of the rock material, a more effective DOM filtration by the rock formation compared to laboratory extractions, or possibly, bacterial activity in the pore water induced by the borehole disturbance.

J	Liu, RX; Lead, JR; Baker, A				Liu, Ruixia; Lead, Jamie R.; Baker, Andy			Fluorescence characterization of cross flow ultrafiltration derived freshwater colloidal and dissolved organic matter	CHEMOSPHERE												3-D fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectrophotometry was applied to investigate the fluorescence characterization of colloidal organic matter (COM) and truly dissolved organic matter (DOM) from an urban lake and a rural river fractionated by the cross flow ultrafiltration (CFUF) process with a 1 kDa membrane. Relatively high tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity is found in the urban water, although the fluorescence of both water samples is mainly dominated by humic/fulvic-like fluorophores. During CFUF processing, the fluorescence intensities of humic/fulvic-like materials in the retentate increased rapidly, but a slight increase is also observed in the permeate fluorescence intensity. Very different ultrafiltration behaviour occurred with respect to the tryptophan-like fluorophore, where both permeate and retentate fluorescence intensities increase substantially at the beginning of the CFUF process, then tend to remain constant at high concentration factor (cf) values. Comparison with tryptophan standards demonstrates that freshwater tryptophan-like fluorescence is not dissolved and 'free', but is, in part, colloidal and related to the ultrafiltration behaviour of fulvic/humic-like matter. A good linear relationship between the retentate humic/fulvic-like fluorescence intensity and organic carbon concentration further reveals that fluorescent humic/fulvic-like substances are the dominant contributors to colloidal organic carbon, mainly in the colloidal fraction.

Absolute bimolecular reaction rate constants for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals (circle OH) with DOM (k circle(OH, DOM)) were determined. k circle(OH, DOM) values are expressed as moles of carbon. Based on direct measurement of transient DOM radicals DOM circle) and competition kinetic techniques, both using pulse radiolysis, the k circle(OH, DOM) value for a standard fulvic acid from the Suwannee River purchased from the International Humic Substances Society was (1.60 +/- 0.24) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1). Both pulse radiolysis methods yielded comparable k circle(OH, DOM) values. The k circle(OH, DOM) values for the seven DOM isolates from different sources ranged from 1.39 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) to 4.53 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), and averaged 2.23 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) (equivalent to 1.9 x 10(4)(mgC/L)(-1) s(-1)). These values represent the first direct measurements of k circle(OH, DOM), and they compare well with literature values obtained via competition kinetic techniques during ozone or ultraviolet irradiation experiments. More polar, lower-molecular-weight DOM isolates from wastewater have higher k circle(OH, DOM) values. In addition, the formation (microsecond time scale) and decay (millisecond time scale) of DOM circle transients were observed for the first time. DOM circle from hydrophobic acids exhibited broader absorbance spectra than transphilic acids, while wastewater DOM isolates had narrower DOM circle spectra more skewed toward shorter wavelengths than did DOM circle spectra for hydrophobic acids.																	0013-936X					JUL 1	2007	41	13					4640	4646		10.1021/es062529n						WOS:000247782500033	17695909

Don) wood chips at various temperatures; these charcoals were used to remove dissolved organic matter (DOM) that was eluted from rice-straw. In order to confirm the adsorption characteristics, three experiments were carried out in the laboratory. The adsorption characteristics were estimated by determining the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, adsorption isotherm and the pH in solutions. Results showed that the trend of DOM adsorption effect by charcoals was categorized into two groups: group-1 (charcoals carbonized at less than 750 degrees C) and group-2 (charcoals carbonized at more than 850 degrees C). Group-2 adsorbed a greater amount of DOM and at a more rapid rate than group-1. The adsorption isotherm for group-2 followed the Freundlich model. In particular, the Freundlich constants, K and 1/N, for the charcoal carbonized at 1,050 degrees C indicated that this charcoal had higher adsorption volume and adsorption intensity for DOM than other charcoals. Furthermore, this charcoal adsorbed TOC irrespective of the initial pH value in sample water. This indicated that charcoals carbonized at 1,050 degrees C could change the pH value of the water contaminated with acid to neutral.																	0021-3551					JUL	2007	41	3					211	217								WOS:000249505500006

Salmon influences on dissolved organic matter in a coastal temperate brown-water stream: An application of fluorescence spectroscopy	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined how spawning Pacific salmon ( genus Oncorhynchus) affect streamwater concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and dissolved organic matter in Peterson Creek, a stream in southeast Alaska. When spawning salmon were present, concentrations of ammonium ( NH4- N) increased by more than 100 times over prespawning levels and concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus increased by more than an order of magnitude. In contrast, concentrations of nitrate ( NO3- N) increased by only two to three times during spawning and were not significantly higher than at an upstream reference site with no salmon. During spawning, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen were significantly higher in the spawning reach compared with the upstream reference site. The influx of salmon- derived dissolved organic matter ( DOM) altered the fluorescence index ( FI), which has previously been used to distinguish between terrestrial and aquatic sources of DOM, with the FI increasing significantly during the salmon run. Salmon DOM was rich in protein compared with the DOM derived from the terrestrial portion of the watershed. Spawning salmon may be an important source of labile DOM in Peterson Creek.																	0024-3590					JUL	2007	52	4					1580	1587		10.4319/lo.2007.52.4.1580						WOS:000248215800025

We assessed the impact of DOM photoproducts and mineral nutrient supply on bacterial growth in seven inland waters from the South of Spain, where DOM is characterized by low chromophoric content and long residence time. Factorial experiments were performed with presence vs absence of DOM photoproducts and mineral nutrient supply. In six of the seven experiments, we found a significant and negative effect of DOM photoproducts on bacterial growth and a significant and positive effect of mineral nutrient supply. The interaction of these two factors leaded to a compensation of negative effects of photoproducts by availability of mineral nutrients. Dissolved organic matter diagenetic status and the ionic environment where organic carbon is dissolved can be influencing bacterial DOM processing.

J	Hudson, N; Baker, A; Reynolds, D				Hudson, Naomi; Baker, Andy; Reynolds, Darren			Fluorescence analysis of dissolved organic matter in natural, waste and polluted waters - A review	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic systems originates from a range of sources. Some is allochthonous, transported from the surrounding landscape to the water body, and is derived from and influenced by the geology, land use and hydrology of its origin. Some is created in situ through microbial activity, which may provide an independent source of organic matter, or a recycling mechanism for that which has been transported into the water body. The relative contribution of each source depends upon the location and environmental conditions within and without the water body. Human activity is also a source of DOM, much of which is believed to be labile, which can enter the aquatic system through direct point discharges, diffuse leaching and aerial dispersal. Fluorescence spectroscopy can provide an excellent too] to source DOM fractions, and to monitor and understand DOM transformations in aquatic systems, as much DOM has an intrinsic fluorescence. In particular, recent advances in optical technology, enabling rapid investigation of shorter wavelengths, have enabled more detailed characterization of organic material and its reactions in water. In this article, we review the use of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques to measure the intrinsic fluorescence of organic matter and the application of fluorescent DOM analysis in marine waters, freshwaters and wastewaters.

J	Hagedorn, F; Machwitz, M				Hagedorn, Frank; Machwitz, Miriam			Controls on dissolved organic matter leaching from forest litter grown under elevated atmospheric CO2	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												The aim of our study was to identify controls on initial dissolved organic matter (DOM) leaching from decomposing forest litter and to estimate how it is affected by increasing atmospheric CO2. Using microcosms, we measured initial C mineralization and leaching rates of DOC, DON and biodegradable DOC from litter of eight tree species from CO2 enrichment experiments in a 100 year-old broadleaf forest and a 30 year-old treeline ecosystem. Over 11 weekly leaching cycles, between 2.5% (Pinus uncinata, Fagus sylvatica) and 15% (Carpinus betulus) of litter C were leached as DOC, corresponding to 9-36% of the total mass loss. Significantly less, 0.9% (Pinus) to 4.5% (Tilia platyphyllos) of litter N was leached as DON. Leaching of DOC was not correlated to C mineralization, which ranged between 12% (Fagus) and 32% (Tilia) of litter C. While C mineralization increased with decreasing litter C/N ratios and lignin contents, DOC leaching particularly the initially leached DOC was significantly related to concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and phenolics. DOC leached after the third leaching cycle did not correlate with any of the measures of litter quality, but with the molar UV absorptivity of DOC, suggesting that DOC production is linked to lignin degradation. Previous CO2 enrichment increased NSC and phenolics in the litter and decreased lignin contents, which resulted in significantly greater initial C mineralization (+5%) and DOC leaching rates (+16%). However, these CO2 effects were only significant during the initial leaching phase and much smaller than the differences between tree species. Initially leached DOC was less biodegradable when its parent litter was grown under elevated than under ambient CO2 (38% vs. 42% of DOC across all species, P < 0.05). Therefore, leaching of 'refractory' DOC was increased under elevated CO2, which will rather accelerate DOC inputs into mineral soils than further stimulate microbial activity. In summary, our study shows (1) that initial DOM leaching is controlled by other factors than C mineralization; and (2) that CO2 enrichment of forests can stimulate initial mineralization and leaching of C from litter by altering its quality, but these effects will be short-term and much smaller than any change in species composition.

The systems were built using plastic containers (0.93 m long, 0.59 m wide and 0.52 m high) that were filled with an 0.35 m layer of wetted gravel (D-60 = 3.5 mm, uniformity coefficient C-u = D-60/D-10 = 1.7) and the water level was maintained at 0.05 m under the gravel surface to give a water depth of 0.30 m. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in COD removal between the two systems. Both systems generally had COD removal rates of over 90%, which is quite high if the heavy load applied is taken into account. The removal of ammonium was greater in the glucose-fed system (57%) in comparison with the starch-fed system (43%). Based on mass balance calculations and stoichiometric relationships, it was estimated that denitrification and sulphate reduction were minor pathways for the removal of organic matter. Indirect observations allowed to assume that methanogenesis made a highly significant contribution to the removal of organic matter.

J	Spencer, RGM; Bolton, L; Baker, A				Spencer, Robert G. M.; Bolton, Lucy; Baker, Andy			Freeze/thaw and pH effects on freshwater dissolved organic matter fluorescence and absorbance properties from a number of UK locations	WATER RESEARCH												The UV-visible and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectrophotometric properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were compared for the effects of both pH and freeze/ thaw on a wide range of freshwater DOM samples from the United Kingdom. It was observed that the spectrophotometric properties of our freshwater samples were sensitive to pH and that the recorded change varies with fluorescence and absorbance intensity, DOC concentration and the wavelength observed. Large and variable responses to pH were particularly severe at extremes of pH, but within the natural levels typically observed in freshwaters the response to pH was limited. For the same sample set large and variable responses were observed when subjected to freeze/thaw. From our data, knowledge of the original properties cannot be used to determine the amount of change that will occur with freezing and subsequent thawing. It is therefore recommended that in future research, to maintain the natural signal of the DOM, analysis is conducted at natural pH and without freezing to facilitate ease of comparison between studies. Our results also have implications for studies that utilise spectrophotometric techniques to investigate longterm trends in dissolved organic carbon in rivers. Spectrophotometric parameters from upland derived samples show varied responses of samples to pH and there is clear potential to complicate trends in the interpretation of long-term water colour data if pH is changing over time in a system or if samples are treated with different storage protocols with respect to acidification and freezing.

J	Jin, X; Hu, JY; Ong, SL				Jin, Xue; Hu, Jiangyong; Ong, Say Leong			Influence of dissolved organic matter on estrone removal by NF membranes and the role of their structures	WATER RESEARCH												The influence of different dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the removal of steroid hormone estrone during nanofiltration (NF) processes was investigated. Commercial dextran and humic acid (HA) as well as hydrophobic acid fraction (HpoA) derived from treated effluent were selected as DOM. To better understand the mechanism by which they affect estrone transport across NF membrane, the structural characteristics of DOM were also examined. The experimental results showed that DOM studied displayed obviously diverse impacts on estrone removal by NF membranes. These impacts were found to correlate with the structural characteristics of DOM. The presence of dextran without aromatic ring had little effects on the fate and transport of estrone during NF processes. The addition of HA without phenolic groups but great aromaticity improved estrone adsorption on membrane significantly while the "enhancement effect" on estrone rejection was limited. Moreover, estrone rejection by NF membranes was obviously increased by the presence of HpoA which possesses both phenolic groups and aromaticity. Some of the findings reported may be critically important for understanding the removal mechanism of estrone by NF membrane in real water matrix where various DOM co-present. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial variability in dissolved organic matter and inorganic nitrogen concentrations in a semiarid stream, San Pedro River, Arizona	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We performed synoptic sampling of a 95-km reach of the San Pedro River, Arizona, to identify the effects of regional hydrology and land use on dissolved carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Six synoptic surveys, two before, two during, and two after the 2002 monsoon season, encompassed periods of both low and high stream discharge. Chloride concentrations and delta(18)O values during low-flow periods indicated the river was divided into three hydrologically distinct reaches each roughly 30 km long. Upper and lower reaches were characterized by areas of localized groundwater input followed by downstream evapo-concentration gradients, limited downstream solute transport, and highly variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. In contrast, the middle reach was characterized by widespread groundwater input, continuous downstream hydrologic connectivity, and less variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. During the monsoon season, base flow discharge increased five-to ten-fold, dissolved organic matter and inorganic N increased two- to ten-fold, Fluorescence Index (FI) values indicated a large input of terrestrial solutes, and both chloride concentrations and delta(18)O values indicated that stream water and alluvial groundwater were well mixed along the entire 95 km reach. Concurrently, the middle reach that exhibited continuous hydrologic connectivity during the nonmonsoon season was a net sink for N, while the reaches characterized by limited hydrologic connectivity during the low-flow season exhibited net N export. Our data suggest that instream biogeochemical cycling during the monsoon season is influenced by antecedent conditions, specifically hydrologic connectivity, during the dry season.																	0148-0227					JUN 30	2007	112	G3							G03S05	10.1029/2006JG000262						WOS:000247686000001

Copper(II) binding to dissolved organic matter fractions in municipal solid waste incinerator bottom ash leachate	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Information on Cu speciation in municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash leachate is needed for Cu leaching predictions and toxicity estimates. The complexation of Cu with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in leachates from a stored MSWI bottom ash was studied potentiometrically using a Cu-ion selective electrode. More than 95% of the copper was bound to DOM in the hydrophilic fraction of the leachate, indicating that the hydrophilic acids contribute to Cu complex formation. The hydrophilic acids constituted 58% of the dissolved organic carbon in the ash leachate. Comparisons between experimental results and speciation calculations with the NICA-Donnan model and the Stockholm humic model indicated differences between the ash DOM and the natural DOM for which the models have been calibrated. The ratio of carboxylic binding sites to phenolic binding sites was 2 times larger in ash DOM, and the Cu-binding affinity of the former was stronger than accounted for by the generic Cu-binding parameters. The Cu-binding affinity of the phenolic sites, on the other hand, was weaker. When these parameters were adjusted, a good description of the experimental data was obtained.

Probing the oxidation-reduction properties of terrestrially and microbially derived dissolved organic matter	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been shown to be an integral component in biogeochemical electron transfer reactions due to its demonstrated ability to facilitate redox reactions. While the role of DOM as a facilitator of electron transfer processes has been demonstrated, greater knowledge would lead to better understanding of the structural components responsible for redox behavior, such as quinones and nitrogen and sulfur (N/S) functional groups. This investigation uses direct scan voltammetry (DSV) coupled with fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy as well as thermochemolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate the organic moieties responsible for facilitating electron transfer reactions. We contrast electrochemical properties and structural details of three organic matter isolates from diverse sources; Great Dismal Swamp DOM (terrestrially derived, highly aromatic), Pony Lake DOM (microbially derived, highly aliphatic) and Toolik Lake (terrestrially derived, photochemically and microbially altered) with juglone (a redox-active model quinone). Aromatic and phenolic constituents were detected (by 1 3 C NMR) and recovered (by thermochemolysis GC-MS) from all three fulvic acid samples, highlighting the ubiquity of these compounds and suggesting that the quinone-phenol redox couple is not limited to DOM derived from lignin precursors. The range of hydroxy-benzene and benzoic acid derivatives may explain the lack of a single pair of well-defined oxidation and reduction peaks in the DSV scans. The presence of a wide-range of hydroxylated benzoic acid isomers and other redox-active aromatic residues implies that native DOM possesses overlapping redox potentials analogous to their characteristic range of pK(a) values.

Dissolved organic matter fractions formed during composting of winery and distillery residues: Evaluation of the process by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix	CHEMOSPHERE												The aim of the present paper is to assess the maturity degree reached by different samples of several mixtures from winery and distillery residues composted using the Rutgers composting system, by means of excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The composts were sampled once a week for about 200 d. EEM spectra indicate the presence of different fluorophores. The fluorescence intensities of these peaks show trends related to the maturity of the composting samples selected. The "contour density" of EEM maps is strongly modified through time. We have used the quantitative method of fluorescence regional integration (FRI). The EEMs were delineated into five excitation-emission regions, The degree of compost maturity could be correlated with the percentage of the volumetric integration under the EEM within each region. Further refinement of these techniques should provide a relatively rapid method for assessing the suitability of the compost to soil application. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Said-Pullicino, D; Gigliotti, G				Said-Pullicino, D.; Gigliotti, G.			Oxidative biodegradation of dissolved organic matter during composting	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the microbial degradation of compost since it represents the most active organic fraction, both biologically and chemically. The detailed evaluation of the changes in the chemical and biochemical characteristics of DOM induced by oxidative biodegradation, presented in this work highlights the mechanisms involved in the degradation of soluble organic matter during composting. In fact, the results show that during the initial stages of composting, DOM is highly degradable under aerobic conditions, particularly due to the predominance of labile, hydrophilic compounds such as carbohydrates, amino acids and proteins. As such compounds are degraded more resistant aromatic moieties accumulate in solution resulting in a reduction in the degradability of DOM with composting time. This decrease in degradability was found to be highly correlated with microbial oxygen demand, and could have important implications in the evaluation of the composting process.

J	Liang, S; Song, LF				Liang, Shuang; Song, Lianfa			Characteristics and fouling behaviors of dissolved organic matter in submerged membrane bioreactor systems	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Although the significance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in membrane bioreactor (MBR) fouling has been increasingly noted in recent studies, little information is available on the characteristics and fouling potential of DOM at the fractional level. This study sought to gain a more fundamental understanding of the complicated DOM fouling phenomenon. DOM in MBR systems was fractionated into more homogeneous components, namely, hydrophobic aquatic humic substances (AHS), hydrophilic acids (HiA), hydrophilic bases (HiB), and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN) on the basis of hydrophobicity and charge. The fractionation results revealed that hydrophobic AHS were the most abundant component of DOM in MBR systems, whereas the amount and nature of hydrophilic components were variable and sample source specific. Fouling experiments were performed in a stirred-cell filtration system with various types of DOM (i.e., original, prefiltered, and fractionated). The fouling potential of DOM was observed to be greatly affected by its characteristics, and there appeared to be a strong link between the high fouling potential of DOM and its high content of AHS. The key importance of AHS as the major foulants of DOM in MBR systems was further confirmed by the fact that AHS exhibited the highest fouling potential among the four fractional DOM components. Also, it was noted that HiN showed much higher fouling potential than HiA and HiB, and induced mainly irreversible fouling.																	1092-8758					JUN	2007	24	5					652	662		10.1089/ees.2006.0147						WOS:000246388300007

Physico-chemical and biological controls on dissolved organic matter in peat aggregate columns	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												We investigated the importance of physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a peaty soil. Columns containing peat aggregates (embedded within a sand matrix) provided an experimental system in which both convective and diffusive processes contributed to DOM leaching. The use of aggregated peat avoided the problems associated with traditional batch equilibration experiments in which soil structure is destroyed. Biotic and abiotic processes operating in the columns were manipulated by working with two unsterilized columns (at 5 degrees C and 22 degrees C) and one gamma irradiation-sterilized column (5 degrees C). Continuous solute flows (< 80 hours) and periods of flow interruption (five interruptions of 6 hours to 384 hours) were applied to the columns (using a 1-mM NaCl electrolyte) to investigate mechanisms of diffusion-controlled release of DOM. For all columns, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) effluent concentrations increased after resumption of flow and the maximum concentrations increased with increased flow-interruption duration. Measurements of effluent UV absorbance (lambda = 285 nm) showed that the DOM leached immediately after the flow interruptions contained fewer aromatic moieties of lower molecular weight than the DOM leached after periods of steady flow. The sterilized column had larger DOC and DON effluent concentration spikes than those from the unsterilized column at 5 degrees C (38 mg C dm(-3) and 6.5 mg N dm(-3) versus 13 mg C dm(-3) and 6.5 mg N dm(-3) after the 384 hours flow interruption). This result suggested that the concentrations of DOM resulting from physico-chemical release mechanisms (sterilized column) were attenuated by biological activity (unsterilized columns). Our results indicate that the peat's microporous structure provides reservoirs of DOM that interact with solute in transport pores via abiotic, rate-controlled mass transport. Hence, diffusion can influence the quantity and composition of DOM leached from peat in the field depending on intensity and duration of rainfall.

To study how algal-derived organic matter and temperature influenced the abundance of different Vibrio spp., Baltic Sea microcosms inoculated with Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus and native bacterioplankton, were exposed to different temperatures (12-25 degrees C) and amended with dissolved organic matter from Nodularia spumigena (0-4.2 mg C L-1). Vibrio abundance was monitored by culture-dependent and molecular methods. Results suggested that Vibrio populations entered a viable but nonculturable state during the incubations. Abundance of Vibrio spp. and total bacterioplankton were orders of magnitude higher in microcosms amended with organic matter compared with reference microcosms. Vibrio cholerae abundances ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) in treatments amended with 4.2 mg C L-1. Vibrio cholerae abundance relative to total bacterioplankton and other Vibrio spp. also increased > 10-fold. In addition, V. vulnificus abundance increased in mesocosms with the highest organic matter addition (0.9-1.8 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)). Temperature alone did not significantly affect abundances of total bacterioplankton, total Vibrio spp. or individual Vibrio populations. By contrast, cyanobacterial-derived organic matter represented an important factor regulating growth and abundance of V. cholerae and V. vulnificus in brackish waters.

Lake Peipsi is the fourth largest lake by area, and the largest transboundary lake in Europe, being shared between Estonia and Russia. Lake Peipsi has been anthropogenically impacted over a longer time-scale than that covered by instrumental limnological monitoring. The Pb-210 record and down-core distribution of fly-ash particles in the 40-cm core from the middle part of the lake suggest 130 years of sediment accumulation. Diatom assemblages indicate alkaline mesotrophic conditions and a well-illuminated water column, sediment pore-water fluorescence index values suggest low autochthonous productivity and a stable aquatic ecosystem similar to natural reference conditions during the second half of 19th and early 20th century. Near-synchronous stratigraphic changes including the expansion of the eutrophic planktonic diatom Stephanodiscus parvus, the appearance of new species associated with eutrophic lakes and the decrease in the relative abundance of littoral diatoms, together with changes in the fluorescence properties of sediment pore-water dissolved organic matter, imply increased nutrient availability, enlarged phytoplankton crops, reduced watercolumn transparency and the onset of human-induced disturbances in the lake since the mid-20th century. The most conspicuous expansion of eutrophic planktonic diatoms and maximum concentration of siliceous microfossils occur simultaneously with changes in the fluorescence indexes of pore-water dissolved organic matter, indicating a pronounced increase in the contribution of autochthonous organic matter to the lake sediment. This implies that nutrient loading and anthropogenic impact was at a maximum during the 1970s and 1980s. Sedimentary diatom flora may reflect a reduction of phosphorus loading since the 1990s. However, the absolute abundance of planktonic diatoms and sediment pore-water fluorescence index values vary greatly implying that the lake ecosystem is still rather unstable.																	0018-8158					JUN	2007	584						133	143		10.1007/s10750-007-8615-2						WOS:000246583500014

Periodate oxidation of marine high molecular weight dissolved organic matter: Evidence for a major contribution from 6-deoxy- and methyl sugars	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to infer that marine high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM) is a mixture of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. However, acid and base catalyzed hydrolysis of HMWDOM followed by molecular level analyses using gas and liquid chromatography provide only low to modest yields of simple sugars, amino acids, and lipids. Here we use periodate over-oxidation to investigate the composition of HMWDOM. Our analyses show that the oxidation of HMWDOM carbohydrate consumes more periodate per carbon on a molar basis (1.3:1) than simple sugars (0.8:1) or linear polysaccharides (1.0:1), and that HMWDOM is highly branched. We also recover acetic acid and methanol as major oxidation products. Methanol and acetic acid are derived from the oxidation of methyl and 6-deoxy sugars, and our analyses suggest these sugars are major components of HMWDOM. Periodate over-oxidation shows that lipids are not major constituents of HMWDOM, and that most of the alkyl carbon observed in the (CNMR)-C-13 spectra between 0-45 ppm that has been previously assigned to lipids is due to the methyl carbons of acetamide and 6-deoxy sugars.

Release of dissolved organic matter during oxic and anoxic decomposition of salt marsh cordgrass	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as the light absorbing fraction of bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM), plays a number of important roles in the global and local biogeochernical cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and in controlling the optical properties of estuarine and coastal waters. Intertidal areas such as salt marshes can contribute significant amounts of the CDOM that is exported to the ocean, but the processes controlling this CDOM source are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the production of DOM and CDOM from the decomposition of two salt marsh cordgrasses, Spartina patens, a C-4 grass, and Typha latifiblia, a C-3 grass, in well-controlled laboratory experiments. During the seven-week incubation period of the salt marsh grasses in oxic and anoxic seawater, changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, dissolved nitrogen (DN) concentrations, stable carbon isotopic composition of DOC (DOC-delta(13) C), and CDOM fluorescence demonstrate a significant contribution of DOC and CDOM to estuarine waters from salt marsh plants, such as Spartina and Typha species. In the natural environment, however, the release processes of CDOM from different cordgrass species could be controlled largely by the in situ oxic and anoxic conditions present during degradation which affects both the production and decomposition of DOC and CDOM, as well as the optical properties of CDOM in estuarine and coastal waters.

Complexation of copper by sewage sludge-derived dissolved organic matter: Effects on soil sorption behaviour and plant uptake	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The complexation of Cu by sewage sludge-derived dissolved organic matter (SSDOM) is a process by which the environmental significance of the element may become enhanced due to reduced soil sorption and, hence, increased mobility. The work described in this paper used an ion selective electrode procedure to show that SSDOM complexation of Cu was greatest at intermediate pH values because competition between hydrogen ions and Cu for SSDOM binding sites, and between hydroxyl ions and SSDOM as Cu ligands, was lowest at such values. Batch sorption experiments further showed that the process of Cu complexation by SSDOM provided an explanation for enhanced desorption of Cu from the solid phase of a contaminated, organic matter-rich, clay loam soil, and reduced adsorption of Cu onto the solid phase of a sandy loam soil. Complexation of Cu by SSDOM did not affect uptake of Cu by spring barley plants, when compared to free ionic Cu, in a sand-culture pot experiment. However, it did appear to lead to greater biomass yields of the plant; perhaps indicating that the Cu-SSDOM complex had a lower toxicity towards the plant than the free Cu ion.

Variability in the bulk composition and abundance of dissolved organic matter in the lower Mississippi and Pearl rivers	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] In this study, we examined the temporal and spatial variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) abundance and composition in the lower Mississippi and Pearl rivers and effects of human and natural influences. In particular, we looked at bulk C/N ratio, stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry of high molecular weight (HMW; 0.2 mu m to 1 kDa) DOM. Monthly water samples were collected at one station in each river from August 2001 to 2003. Surveys of spatial variability of total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen ( DON) were also conducted in June 2003, from 390 km downstream in the Mississippi River and from Jackson to Stennis Space Center in the Pearl River. Higher DOC ( 336 - 1170 mu M), C/N ratio,% aromaticity, and more depleted delta N-15 (0.76 - 2.1 parts per thousand) were observed in the Pearl than in the lower Mississippi River (223 - 380 mu M, 4.7 - 11.5 parts per thousand, respectively). DOC, C/N ratio, delta C-13, delta N-15, and % aromaticity of Pearl River HMW DOM were correlated with water discharge, which indicated a coupling between local soil inputs and regional precipitation events. Conversely, seasonal variability in the lower Mississippi River was more controlled by spatial variability of a larger integrative signal from the watershed as well as in situ DOM processing. Spatially, very little change occurred in total DOC in the downstream survey of the lower Mississippi River, compared to a decrease of 24% in the Pearl River. Differences in DOM between these two rivers were reflective of the Mississippi River having more extensive river processing of terrestrial DOM, more phytoplankton inputs, and greater anthropogenic perturbation than the Pearl River.

CDOM profiles showed distinctive features well correlated with hydrographic characteristics. CDOM fluorescence was particularly high at depths between 40 and 200 m ( up to 3 fluorescence units (Fl. U.)) in both Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea transects. Penetration of the high CDOM signal, formed on the shelves, into the Canada Basin was confined to the upper halocline layer ( salinity of similar to 33.1). This layer had distinctive 3-D EEM fingerprints in fluorescence spectra, showing a marked terrestrial humic signature. The presence of CDOM in the halocline layer likely resulted from two main processes: the brine rejection during sea ice formation and transport across the sediment-water interface during early diagenesis. Despite the high primary productivity in the Chukchi shelf, CDOM contribution from in situ production seemed to have little influence on the overall CDOM distributions in the study area.

Thiourea catalysis of MeHg ligand exchange between natural dissolved organic matter and a thiol-functionalized resin: a novel method of matrix removal and MeHg preconcentration for ultratrace Hg speciation analysis in freshwaters	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY					8th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant	AUG 06-11, 2006	Madison, WI	Univ Wisconsin Madison, US Geol Survey, Univ Wisconsin La Crosse				Ultratrace analysis of dissolved MeHg in freshwaters requires both dissociation of MeHg from strong ligands in the sample matrix and preconcentration for detection. Existing solid phase extraction methods generally do not efficiently adsorb MeHg from samples containing high concentrations of natural dissolved organic matter. We demonstrate here that the addition of 10-60 mM thiourea (TU) quantitatively releases MeHg from the dissolved matrix of freshwater samples by forming a more labile complex (MeHgTU+) that quantitatively exchanges MeHg with thiol-functionalized resins at pH similar to 3.5 during column loading. The contents of these columns were efficiently eluted with acidified TU and MeHg was analyzed by Hg-TU complex ion chromatography with cold-vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry detection. Routinely more than 90% of MeHg was recovered with good precision (average relative standard deviation of 6%) from natural waters-obtained from pools and saturated sediments of wetlands and from rivers-containing up to 68.7 mg C L-1 dissolved organic matter. With the preconcentration step, the method detection limit of 0.29 pg absolute or 0.007 ng L-1 in 40-mL samples is equivalent to that of the current state-of-the- art as practiced by skilled analysts. MeHg in 20-50-mL samples was completely trapped. On the basis of our knowledge of the chemistry of the process, breakthrough volume should depend on the concentrations of TU and H+. At a TU concentration of 12 mM breakthrough occurred between 50 and 100 mL, but overall adsorption efficiency was still 85% at 100 mL. Formation of artifactual MeHg is minimal; only about 0.7% of ambient MeHg is artifactual as estimated from samples spiked with 4 mu g L-1 Hg-II.																	1618-2642					MAY	2007	388	2					341	352		10.1007/s00216-007-1207-1						WOS:000246094000005	17342536

Hydrographic transects covered in aggregate a latitudinal range of 5 degrees to 62 degrees north along longitudes 20 degrees W (line A16N, Leg 1), 52 degrees W (A20), and 66 degrees W (A22). Absorption spectra of filtered seawater samples were collected and analyzed for depths ranging from the surface to similar to 6000m, sampling all the ocean water masses in the western basin of the subtropical North Atlantic and several stations on the North and South American continental slopes. The lowest surface abundances of CDOM (< 0.1 m(-1) absorption coefficient at 325 nm) were found in the central subtropical gyres while the highest surface abundances (similar to 0.7 m(-1)) were found along the continental shelves and within the subpolar gyre, confirming recent satellite-based assessments of surface CDOM distribution. Within the ocean interior, CDOM abundances were relatively high (0.1-0.2 m(-1) absorption coefficient at 325 nm) except in the subtropical mode water, where a local minimum exists due to the subduction of low CDOM surface waters during mode water formation. In the subthermocline water masses of the western basin, changes in CDOM abundance are not correlated with increasing ventilation age as assessed using chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) concentrations and the atmospheric CFC history. But dissolved organic carbon (DOC) mass-specific absorption coefficients of CDOM increase with increasing ventilation age in the deep sea, indicating that CDOM is a refractory component of the DOC pool. The overall CDOM distribution in the North Atlantic reflects the rapid advection and mixing processes of the basin and demonstrates that remineralization in the ocean interior is not a significant sink for CDOM. This supports the potential of CDOM as a tracer of ocean circulation processes for subducted water masses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Absorption spectra of lake water samples were measured from 240 nm to 800 nm. Highest values of a(lambda), DOC and F-n (355) occurred near the river inflow to Meiliang Bay and decreased towards the central lake basin. A significant spatial difference was found between Meiliang Bay and the central lake basin in absorption coefficient, DOC-specific absorption coefficient, exponential slope coefficient, DOC concentration and fluorescence value. The spatial distribution of CDOM suggested that a major part of CDOM in the lake was from river input. CDOM absorption coefficients were correlated with DOC over the wavelength range 280-500 nm, and a(355) was also correlated with F-n (355), which showed that CDOM absorption could be inferred from DOC and fluorescence measurement. The coefficient of variation between a(lambda) and DOC concentration decreased with increase in wavelength from 240 nm to 800 nm. Furthermore, a significant negative linear relationship was recorded between S value and CDOM absorption coefficient, as well as DOC-specific absorption coefficient. S value and DOC-specific absorption coefficient were used as a proxy for CDOM composition and source. Accurate CDOM absorption measurements are very useful in explaining UV attenuation and in developing, validating remote sensing model of water quality in Lake Taihu.

Sorption and fractionation of dissolved organic matter and associated phosphorus in agricultural soil	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Mobility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly affects the export of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from soils to surface waters. To study the sorption and mobility of dissolved organic C and P (DOC, DOP) in soil, the pH-dependent sorption of DOM to samples from Ap, EB, and Bt horizons from a Danish agricultural Humic Hapludult was investigated and a kinetic model applicable in field-scale models tested. Sorption experiments of 1 to 72 h duration were conducted at two pH levels (pH 5.0 and 7.0) and six initial DOC concentrations (04.7 mmol L-1). Most sorption/desorption occurred during the first few hours. Dissolved organic carbon and DOP sorption decreased strongly with increased pH and desorption dominated at pH 7, especially for DOC. Due to fractionation during DOM sorption/ desorption at DOC concentrations up to 2 mmol L-1, the solution fraction of DOM was enriched in P indicating preferred leaching of DOP. The kinetics of sorption was expressed as a function of how far the solution DOC or DOP concentrations deviate from "equilibrium." The model was able to simulate the kinetics of DOC and DOP sorption/ desorption at all concentrations investigated and at both pH levels making it useful for incorporation in field-scale models for quantifying DOC and DOP dynamics.

J	Rottgers, R; Doerffer, R				Roettgers, Ruediger; Doerffer, Roland			Measurements of optical absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter using a point-source integrating-cavity absorption meter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The light absorption of 0.22-mu m filtered seawater samples from the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean was measured by a point-source integrating-cavity absorption meter (PSICAM), and the results were compared with measurement in a spectrophotometer. The absorption coefficient of this Gelbstoff or chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) ranges from high values of 0.103 to 0.519 m(-1) at 442 nm for samples from the North Sea to very low values of 0.004 to 0.046 m(-1) for samples from the Atlantic Ocean. At these low values, the influence of sample temperature and salinity on water absorption was significant. Hence, instrument-specific temperature and salinity coefficients were determined and, subsequently, used for correcting absorption data. Spectrophotometrically determined absorption was significantly higher at shorter wavelengths (<442 nm) than absorption measured by the PSICAM, probably showing a significant influence of scattering by small particles remaining in the sample after filtration. At wavelengths between 442 and 500 nm, the correlation of PSICAM and spectrophotometer followed the 1: 1 correspondence, whereas at longer wavelengths, the absorption was below the detection limit of the spectrophotometer. A similar agreement was obtained for the exponential slope of the CDOM absorption. The PSICAM matches the spectrophotometer results but is more sensitive and not affected by scattering. It will improve our ability to determine CDOM absorption in oligotrophic waters for the visible light spectral region.																						MAY	2007	5						126	135								WOS:000247293500002

We simulated the effect of a typhoon by adding the annual aboveground litterfall (4600 kg ha(-1)) and about 3 times the annual litterfall (13,900 kg ha(-1)) as fresh leaves in a single event to small manipulation plots. All plots were also subjected to the natural litterfall. Soil solution was collected 4 months before and 15 months following the litter manipulation in 14 days intervals underneath the forest floor with free draining lysimeters and by ceramic suction cups at 60 cm depth. The 3-fold litter addition caused increased fluxes of K, Mg, Ca, and NH4 in forest floor percolates as compared to the 1-fold litter treatment. DOC and DON fluxes also increased, but this was only statistically significant for DON. DON was the dominant form of N both in forest floor percolates and in seepage. The 3-fold litter manipulation increased the seepage fluxes of K, DON, and DOC relative to the I -fold treatment with largest differences recorded for K, reaching 12.4 kg ha(-1) 15 month(-1). The fluxes of DOC with forest floor percolates and with seepage in both treatments exceeded published values by far. Our results suggest that the decomposition of large amounts of fresh leaf litter may trigger K losses from the ecosystem via seepage, whereas the probability for additional N and DOC losses is moderate. For Ca and Mg, additional losses seem to be rather unlikely. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Molecular characterization of dissolved organic matter in a North Brazilian mangrove porewater and mangrove-fringed estuaries by ultrahigh resolution Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry and excitation/emission spectroscopy	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Electrospray ionization (ESI) combined with ultrahigh resolution Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) at 9.4 Tesla has been shown to be an ideal tool for the molecular characterization of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM). Here, we apply this technique for tracing DOM as it moves from mangrove porewaters into a Brazilian estuary and assess the changes that occur in the initial stages of outwelling. Comparisons of molecular features of DOM from the porewater and two sites within the adjacent estuary revealed that mass spacing patterns were far more pronounced in the mangrove porewater DOM, and the average molecular weights of estuarine DOM were lower. Calculation of double bond equivalents and Kendrick mass analysis normalized for both methylene (-CH2-) and oxygen (O) substitution indicated that the lower molecular weights observed in the estuarine DOM were due primarily to loss of high molecular weight, highly unsaturated and/or aromatic components observed in the porewater DOM. Photodegradation is suggested as one mechanism that removes these high molecular weight components once mangrove-derived DOM reaches the estuary. The mass analyses were supported by UV-Vis and 3-D synchronous scanning fluorescence spectroscopy measurements to aid in the characterization of DOM in this unique ecosystem. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the UK, substantial soil C losses have been reported, while at the same time dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland waters have increased, suggesting that soil C stocks may be destabilising in response to climate change. To investigate the link between soil carbon and DOC at a range of sites, soil organic matter, soilwater and streamwater DOC were analysed for radiocarbon (C-14). DOC exported from C-rich landscapes appears younger than the soil C itself, much of it comprising C assimilated post-1950s. DOC from more intensively managed, C-poor soils is older, in some cases > 100 years. Results appear consistent with soil C destabilisation in farmed landscapes, but not in peatlands. Reported C losses may to a significant extent be explained by mechanisms other than climate change, e. g. recovery from acidification in peatlands, and agricultural intensification in managed systems.
