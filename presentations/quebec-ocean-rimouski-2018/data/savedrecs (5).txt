J	Thomsen, M; Dobel, S; Lassen, P; Carlsen, L; Mogensen, BB; Hansen, PE				Thomsen, M; Dobel, S; Lassen, P; Carlsen, L; Mogensen, BB; Hansen, PE			Reverse quantitative structure-activity relationship for modelling the sorption of esfenvalerate to dissolved organic matter - A multivariate approach	CHEMOSPHERE												The sorption of the pyrethroid, esfenvalerate, to the dissolved and/or dispersed fraction of eight different natural humic compounds has been investigated. The dissolved organic matters (DOMs) included in this study originate from ground water, soil pore water, and surface waters. Sorption was modelled at DOM concentration levels where equilibrium partitioning of esfenvalerate between DOM and the aqueous bulk phase prevails. The inherent characteristics of the eight different humic materials, quantified in the preceding paper by Thomsen et al. (2002, this issue (PII: S0045-6535(02)00335-1)), have been used as explanatory variables for modelling this equilibrium partitioning. Using a reverse QSAR approach based on by projection-into-latent-structure regression (PLS-R) inherent sorbent properties determining for the sorption affinity of esfenvalerate to DOM were analysed. For all humic substances a decrease in the DOM-normalised equilibrium-partitioning coefficient, K-DOM, with increasing concentration of DOM was observed. Significant variations in K-DOM values, as function of the inherent characteristics of the individual humic substances, were found at DOM concentrations of 75 and 100 ppm, respectively. The latter is a strong indication of variations in sorption mechanisms of esfenvalerate to DOM of varying inherent properties. Groupings in the principal property space quantifying DOMs may indicate that separate models are needed for quantifying the equilibrium partitioning to different classes of DOM.

The samples consist of isolated fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA), and humic substances (HS), i.e. natural mixtures containing a humic and a fulvic fraction. The humic substances have been characterised by elemental analysis, size exclusion chromatography, E(2)/E(3) and E(4)/E(6) UV absorption ratios, and liquid-state (13)C-NMR spectroscopy. The information contents of the different analytical methods have been investigated by pattern recognition, i.e. cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). A comparative study of the information contents of DOM descriptors derived from different analytical methods is presented. Through extraction of information content of the individual analytical methods the inherent properties of DOM are quantified. Pattern recognition revealed significant quantitative differences in the inherent properties of DOM of different origin and type. PCA based on the NMR descriptors showed highest explained variance. However, all models showed low robustness due to the limited number of samples. The supervised pattern recognition, i.e. PCA, indicates a classification of DOMs into groups of similar properties by an increase in the number of samples. Furthermore that the number of groups may be higher and more continuously distributed than the conventional classification into fulvic acids, humic acids or humic substances.

J	Kim, SB; Corapcioglu, MY				Kim, SB; Corapcioglu, MY			Contaminant transport in dual-porosity media with dissolved organic matter and bacteria present as mobile colloids	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In riverbank filtration, contaminant transport is affected by colloidal particles such as dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacterial particles. In addition, the subsurface heterogeneity influences the behavior of contaminant transport in riverbank filtration. A mathematical model is developed to describe the contaminant transport in dual-porosity media in the presence of DOM and bacteria as mobile colloids. In the model development, a porous medium is divided into the mobile and immobile regions to consider the presence of ineffective micropores in physically heterogeneous riverbanks. We assume that the contaminant transport in the mobile region is controlled by the advection and dispersion while the contaminant transport in the immobile region occurs due to the molecular diffusion. The contaminant transfer between the mobile and immobile regions takes place by diffusive mass transfer. The mobile region is conceptualized as a four-phase system: two mobile colloidal phases, an aqueous phase, and a solid matrix. The complete set of governing equations is solved numerically with a fully implicit finite difference method. The model results show that in riverbank filtration, the contaminant can migrate further than expected due to the presence of DOM and bacteria. In addition, the contaminant mobility increases further in the presence of the immobile region in aquifers. A sensitivity analysis shows that in dual-porosity media, earlier breakthrough of the contaminant takes place as the volumetric fraction of the mobile region decreases. It is also demonstrated that as the contaminant mass transfer rate coefficient between the mobile and immobile regions increases, the contaminant concentration gradient between the two regions reverses at earlier pore volumes. The contaminant mass transfer coefficient between the mobile and immobile regions mainly controls the tailing effect of the contaminant breakthrough. The contaminant breakthrough curves are sensitive to changes in contaminant adsorption and desorption rate coefficients on DOM and bacteria. In situations where the contaminant is released in the presence of DOM and bacteria in dual-porosity media, the early breakthrough and tailing occur due to the colloidal facilitation and presence of immobile regions.

J	Dilling, J; Kaiser, K				Dilling, J; Kaiser, K			Estimation of the hydrophobic fraction of dissolved organic matter in water samples using UV photometry	WATER RESEARCH												. In this study, we tested a simple and rapid method for the estimation of carbon in the hydrophobic fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of different origin (spruce, pine, and beech litter) in soil water. The method is based on the fact that the hydrophobic fraction of DOM contains almost entirely the aromatic moieties of DOM. Thus, it showed a clearly distinct light absorption at 260 nm compared to the hydrophilic fraction. This light absorption was directly proportional to the concentration of the hydrophobic fraction. Moreover, it was independent of the concentration of the hydrophilic fraction. We compared the concentrations of hydrophobic DOM estimated by the UV method with those of the conventional fractionation using chromatographic columns of XAD-8 macroporous resin and found an excellent agreement between the two methods for both solutions from laboratory sorption experiments and field samples of forest floor leachates and subsoil porewaters. In addition, the absorption at 260 nm of hydrophobic DOM proved to be independent of pH values ranging from 2.0 to 6.5. Compared to the conventional chromatographic fractionation, the method using the UV absorption at 260 nm is less time consuming, needs a much smaller sample volume, and showed a better reproducibility. However, its use is restricted to water samples of low nitrate (< 25 mg L-1) and Fe (< 5 mg L-1) concentrations and, probably, with the hydrophobic fraction dominated by aromatic compounds deriving from degradation of lignin.

J	Lu, YF; Allen, HE				Lu, YF; Allen, HE			Characterization of copper complexation with natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) - link to acidic moieties of DOM and competition by Ca and Mg	WATER RESEARCH												We investigated Cu complexation by three dissolved organic matters (DOMs) collected by reverse osmosis (RO). Alkalimetric titration, pH-stat Cu and Ca titrations, pH edges of Cu-DOM complexation, and Ca/Mg-Cu exchange experiments were investigated at I = 10(-2) M for DOM samples of 10 mg C/L. The proton and Cu binding characteristics indicated similarity for all three DOMs. All Cu titrations employed ion selective electrode measurement and indicated the presence of relatively small amounts of strong Cu-binding sites. Four distinct classes of Cu binding sites are required for FITEQL 4.0 to provide good fits to the entire curves. The estimated total Cu binding site density is 4.55 mmol/g C, much less than the total acidity but very close to the phenolic site content. Cu-DOM complexation increases approximately 10-fold per pH unit, even at relatively high pH (> 8). We suggest that sites characterized as phenolic based on alkalimetric titration, not carboxyl sites, account for the majority of Cu complexation under natural water conditions, and Cu-DOM complexation is principally through the replacement of H+ by Cu2+ at the phenolic binding sites. The Cu-H exchange ratio is 1:1 for the first three sites and about 1:2 for the 4th site. This 4-site model describes well the pH dependency of Cu-DOM complexation and provides good estimates of free Cu concentrations throughout wide total copper (Cu-T) and pH ranges. Comparison between Ca-DOM and Cu-DOM complexation demonstrated that (i) Ca-DOM complexation increases much less than an order of magnitude per pH unit and decreases at higher Ca concentration, different from that of Cu-DOM complexation; and (ii) Cu-DOM complexation is highly non-linear, in contrast to the much reduced extent of non-linearity of Ca-DOM complexation. Ca/Mg-Cu exchange experiments showed small competition effect, less than expected by a simple competition model, and the competition tended to reduce with increasing Ca or Mg concentrations. The extent of the competition by Mg and Ca are essentially comparable. Put all together, it suggests that Ca and Mg are preferably bound by carboxyl sites, especially at relatively high concentrations, resulting in a weakened apparent competition effect.

In this paper, we measured the complexation of Cu, Cd, Zn, Ni, and Pb with DOM in the soil solution at pH 3.7-6.1 using a Donnan membrane technique. The results show that the DOM-complexed species is generally more significant for Cu and Pb than for Cd, Zn, and Ni. The ability of two advanced models for ion binding to humic substances, e.g., model VI and NICA-Donnan, in the simulation of metal binding to natural DOM was assessed by comparing the model predictions with the measurements. Using the default parameters of fulvic and humic acid, the predicted concentrations of free metal ions from the solution speciation calculation using the two models are mostly within I order of magnitude difference from the measured concentrations, except for Ni and Pb in a few samples. Furthermore, the solid-solution partitioning of the metals was simulated using a multisurface model, in which metal binding to soil organic matter, dissolved organic matter, clay, and iron hydroxides was accounted for using adsorption and cation exchange models (NICA-Donnan, Donnan, DDL, CD-MUSIC). The model estimation of the dissolved concentration of the metals is mostly within I order of magnitude difference from those measured except for Ni in some samples and Pb. The solubility of the metals depends mainly on the metal loading over soil sorbents, pH, and the concentration of inorganic ligands and DOM in the soil solution.

J	Gigliotti, G; Kaiser, K; Guggenberger, G; Haumaier, L				Gigliotti, G; Kaiser, K; Guggenberger, G; Haumaier, L			Differences in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter from waste material of different sources	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												The chemical composition of waste-material-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) was characterized by chemolytic analyses and H-1, C-13 and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Dissolved organic matter was extracted by water from an aerobic fermented urban waste compost, a sewage sludge and a pig slurry and then fractionated using the XAD-8 method. The amount of water-extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 3% in the sewage sludge to 22% in the pig slurry. Dissolved organic matter isolated from pig slurry was equally distributed between hydrophilic and hydrophobic DOC, whereas in the sewage-sludge-derived material the hydrophobic fraction was predominant. Dissolved organic C from the urban waste compost was mainly within the hydrophilic fraction. Wet-chemical analysis and H-1- and C-13-NMR spectra showed that both DOM fractions from the urban waste compost were low in neutral, acidic and amino sugars as well as in lignin-derived compounds. In turn, the materials were rich in low-molecular-weight aliphatic compounds. The chemical structure of both fractions is probably the result of the intensive transformation of urban waste compost during its fermentation. The hydrophilic fractions of DOM from sewage sludge and pig slurry contained considerable amounts of carbohydrates but were also rich in low-molecular-weight aliphatics. The respective hydrophobic fractions had the largest contents of CuO-extractable phenols which may in part derive from sources other than lignin. By contrast with the other materials, the hydrophobic fraction from the pig slurry seemed to contain polymeric rather than low-molecular-weight material. The P-31-NMR spectrum of the hydrophilic DOM fraction from urban waste compost did not show signals of inorganic or organic P compounds while the spectrum of the hydrophobic fraction revealed traces of monoester P, diester P, and orthophosphate. P-31-NMR spectroscopy suggested that both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions from pig slurry did not contain organic P. The hydrophilic DOM fraction from sewage sludge contained orthophosphate, organic monoester P and a little pyrophosphate. The hydrophobic fraction contained mainly organic diester P and smaller amounts of teichoic acids and organic monoester P. Considering that water-soluble fractions of urban waste compost contained no easily plant-available P and a low content of labile organics, we conclude that this material contains less labile nutrients and is more refractory than the soluble constituents of pig slurry and sewage sludge.

J	Ertunc, T; Hartlieb, N; Berns, A; Kliens, W; Schaeffer, A				Ertunc, T; Hartlieb, N; Berns, A; Kliens, W; Schaeffer, A			Investigations on the binding mechanism of the herbicide simazine to dissolved organic matter in leachates of compost	CHEMOSPHERE												C-14-labelled simazine was composted together with biowaste on a pilot (m(3)) scale. The herbicide was quickly bound to the compost matrix. By aqueous extraction of 29 and 200 days old compost (equivalent to thermophilic and mesophilic phase of composting) only 4.2% and 3.1% respectively of the radioactivity in the compost samples could be extracted with water. Analysis of the extracts using high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) revealed that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) had molecular weights ranging between 2 and 28 kDa. The amount of DOM-associated radioactivity increased from 53% (day 29) to 65% (day 200) of total extractable radioactivity. The type of binding of the C-14-labelled residues and the DOM was elucidated by silylation of humic matter and subsequent HPSEC. The data demonstrated that besides polar metabolites also intact simazine was bound to the DOM. A distinct shift from rather weak interactions to strong covalent linkages of simazine and its metabolites with increasing age of the compost was observed. The results showed that only low amounts of free simazine and its degradates can be extracted with water. We concluded that the shift towards stable covalent linkages is equivalent to a detoxification of the contaminant in aged compost. Consequently, the use of the analysed compost in its mature stage should not pose an environmental risk to the groundwater or the subsoil. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Impellitteri, CA; Lu, YF; Saxe, JK; Allen, HE; Peijnenburg, WJGM				Impellitteri, CA; Lu, YF; Saxe, JK; Allen, HE; Peijnenburg, WJGM			Correlation of the partitioning of dissolved organic matter fractions with the desorption of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn from 18 Dutch soils	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Eighteen Dutch soils were extracted in aqueous solutions at varying pH. Extracts were analyzed for Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn by ICP-AES. Extract dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was also concentrated onto a macroreticular resin and fractionation into three operationally defined fractions: hydrophilic acids (Hyd), humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA). In this manner, change in absolute solution concentration and relative percentage for each fraction could be calculated as a function of extraction equilibrium pH. The soils were also analyzed for solid phase total organic carbon and total recoverable metals (EPA Method 305 1). Partitioning coefficients were calculated for the metals and organic carbon (OC) based on solid phase concentrations (less the metal or OC removed by the extraction) divided by solution concentrations, Cu and Pb concentrations in solution as a function of extract equilibrium pH are greatest at low and high pH resulting in parabolic desorption/dissolution curves. While processes such as proton competition and proton promoted dissolution can account for high solution metal concentrations at low pH, these processes cannot account for higher Cu and Pb concentrations at high pH. DOC increases with increasing pH, concurrently with the increase in Cu and Pb solution concentrations. While the absolute concentrations of FA and HA generally increase with increasing pH, the relative proportional increase is greatest for HA. Variation in HA concentrations spans three orders of magnitude while FA concentrations vary an order of magnitude over the pH range examined, Correlation analysis strongly suggests that HA plays a major role in increasing the concentration of solution Cu and Pb with increasing pH in the 18 soils studied. The percentage of the OC that was due to FA was nearly constant over a wide pH range although the FA concentration increased with increasing pH and its concentration was greater than that of the HA fraction at lower pH values (pH = 3-5). Thus, in more acidic environments, FA may play a larger role than HA in governing organo-metallic interactions. For Cd, Ni, and Zn, the desorption/dissolution pattern shows high metal solution concentrations at low pH with slight increases in solution concentrations at extremely high pH values (pH> 10). The results presented here suggest that the effects of dissolved organic carbon on the mobilization of Cd, Ni, and Zn may only occur in systems governed by very high pH. At high pH, it is difficult to distinguish in this study whether the slightly increased solution-phase concentrations of these cations is due to DOC or hydrolysis reactions. These high pH environments would rarely occur in natural settings. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentration of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a primary factor affecting the absorption of incident sunlight in coastal and estuarine waters. In estuaries, CDOM concentrations vary due to changes in salinity gradients, inflows of industrial and domestic effluents, and the production of new dissolved organic matter from marine biologic activity. CDOM absorption data have been collected from a variety of waters. However, there are a limited number of measurements along the US east coast and a general lack of data from New England waters. This study characterized the temporal and spatial variability of CDOM absorption over an annual cycle in Narragansett Bay and Block Island Sound (Rhode Island). Results suggested that, in Narragansett Bay, the magnitude of CDOM absorption is related to the seasonal variability of freshwater input from surrounding watersheds and new CDOM production from in situ biologic activity. The data show that the average CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm was 0.45 m(-1) and the average spectral slope was 0.020 nm(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Baker, A				Baker, A			Spectrophotometric discrimination of river dissolved organic matter	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												There is a need to be able to differentiate the dissolved organic matter (DOM) fraction in river waters. Research in the 1970s and 1980s has attempted to utilize both absorbance and fluorescence to distinguish between DOM fractions in river waters, but both were limited by the available technology. Total organic carbon content has, therefore, been widely used as a standard method of measuring DOM concentration, although it has little power to differentiate DOM fractions. Recent advances in fluorescence spectrophotometry enable rapid and optically precise analysis of DOM. Here, we show how a combination of both fluorescence and absorbance can be used to discriminate statistically between spatial variations of DOM in tributaries in a small catchment of the Ousebum, NE England. The results of the discriminant analysis suggest that about 70% of the samples can be correctly classified to its tributary. Discriminant function 1 explains 60.8% of the variance in the data and the fulvic-like fluorescence intensity has the largest absolute correlation within this function; discriminant function 2 explains a further 21.5% of the variance and the fulvic-like fluorescence emission wavelength has the largest absolute correlation within this function. The discriminant analysis does not correctly classify all tributaries every time, and successfully discriminates between the different tributaries 70% of the time. Occasions when the tributary waters are less well discriminated are due to either episodic pollution events (at two sites) or due to tributaries that have strong seasonal trends in spectrophotometric parameters, which allows the sites to be misclassified. Results suggest that spectrophotometric techniques have considerable potential in the discrimination of DOM in rivers. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Kaschl, A; Romheld, V; Chen, Y				Kaschl, A; Romheld, V; Chen, Y			Cadmium binding by fractions of dissolved organic matter and humic substances from municipal solid waste compost	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The agricultural practice of amending soils with composted municipal solid waste (MSW) adds significant amounts of organic matter and trace metals, including Cd. Under these conditions, soluble organic complexes of Cd formed in the compost may be more significant than previously thought, due to Cd bioavailability and mobility in the soil environment. To study the relative importance of different types of organic ligands in MSW compost for the binding of Cd, six fractions of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in addition to humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) were extracted and their complexation of Cd quantified at pH 7 using an ion-selective electrode (ISE). The highest complexing capacities (CC) for Cd were found for the most humified ligands: HA (2386 mumol Cd g(-1) C of ligand), predialyzed FA (2468 mumol Cd g(-1) C), and HoA, a fulvic-type, easily soluble fraction (1042 mumol Cd g(-1) C). The differences in CC for Cd of the various organic ligands were not directly related to total acid-titratable or carboxylic groups, indicating the importance of sterical issues and other functional groups. The strength of association between Cd and the organic ligands was characterized by calculating stability constants for binding at the strongest sites (pK(int)) and modeling the distribution of binding site strengths. The pK(int) values of the DOM fractions ranged between 6.93 (HiN: polysaccharides) and 8.11 (HiB: proteins and aminosugars), compared with 10.05 for HA and 7.98 for FA. Hence, the highly complex and only partially soluble organic molecules from compost such as HA and FA demonstrated the highest capacity to sequester Cd. However, strong Cd binding of organic ligands containing N-functional groups (HiB) in addition to a high CC of soluble, humified ligands like HoA indicated the relevance of these fractions for the organic complexation of Cd in solution.																	0047-2425					NOV-DEC	2002	31	6					1885	1892								WOS:000181953300015	12469838

The Ca(II) effect was studied for three coal-based ACs having different pore size distributions (PSDs) and for three DOMs contained in three water samples. For each water sample, four working solutions prepared by adding different dosages of Ca(II) (0-1.5 mM) were used. For the water sample whose adsorption capacity was least affected by Ca(II), the effect of pH was subsequently examined for four water pH levels (pH = 5.5-10) and these three ACs. Isotherm data were analyzed in terms of a modified isotherm model selected from three models developed for normalizing isotherms of heterogeneous organic mixtures. The Ca(II) effect depended obviously on the DOMs used. For all three ACs, increasing Ca(II) greatly enhanced the adsorption capacity of a commercial humic acid. However, the capacity of the DOM in a naturally colored surface water source was much less affected and that of the DOM remaining after precoagulation was not affected. The DOM-Ca(II) interactions, rather than the AC-Ca(II) interactions, seemed to be the predominant mechanism that controlled the extent of the Ca(II)'s impact. Water pH greatly affected the adsorption of the surface water DOM remaining after precoagulation. This effect seemed to be attributed to pH's capability in changing ACs' charge characteristics reflected by zeta-potentials. The adsorption capacity increased as the water pH decreased and was well correlated as a function of pH and the volume of AC pores in sizes of 30-100 Angstrom. ACs having more pores in this size region generally exhibited larger adsorption capacities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Spark, KM; Swift, RS				Spark, KM; Swift, RS			Effect of soil composition and dissolved organic matter on pesticide sorption	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The effect of the solid and dissolved organic matter fractions, mineral composition and ionic strength of the soil solution on the sorption behaviour of pesticides were studied. A number of soils, chosen so as to have different clay mineral and organic carbon content, were used to study the sorption of the pesticides atrazine (6-chloro-N-2-ethyl-N-4-isopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine), 2,4-D ((2,4-dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid), isoproturon (3-(4-isopropylphenyl)1,1-dimethylurea) and paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium) in the presence of low and high levels of dissolved organic carbon and different background electrolytes. The sorption behaviour of atrazine, isoproturon and paraquat was dominated by the solid state soil components and the presence of dissolved organic matter had little effect. The sorption of 2,4-D was slightly affected by the soluble organic matter in the soil. However, this effect may be due to competition for adsorption sites between the pesticide and the soluble organic matter rather than due to a positive interaction between the pesticide and the soluble fraction of soil organic matter. It is concluded that the major factor governing the sorption of these pesticides is the solid state organic fraction with the clay mineral content also making a significant contribution. The dissolved organic carbon fraction of the total organic carbon in the soil and the ionic strength of the soil solution appear to have little or no effect on the sorption/transport characteristics of these pesticides over the range of concentrations studied.

J	Drexel, RT; Haitzer, M; Ryan, JN; Aiken, GR; Nagy, KL				Drexel, RT; Haitzer, M; Ryan, JN; Aiken, GR; Nagy, KL			Mercury(II) sorption to two Florida Everglades peats: Evidence for strong and weak binding and competition by dissolved organic matter released from the peat	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The binding of mercury(II) to two peats from Florida Everglades sites with different rates of mercury methylation was measured at pH 6.0 and 0.01 M ionic strength. The mercury(II) sorption isotherms, measured over a total mercury(II) range of 10(-7.4) to 10(-3.7) M, showed the competition for mercury(II) between the peat and dissolved organic matter released from the peat and the existence of strong and weak binding sites for mercury(II). Binding was portrayed by a model accounting for strong and weak sites on both the peat and the released DOM. The conditional binding constants (for which the ligand concentration was set as the concentration of reduced sulfur in the organic matter as measured by X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy) determined for the strong sites on the two peats were similar (K-peat,K-s = 10(21.8+/-01) and 10(22.0+/-0.1) M-1), but less than those determined for the DOM strong sites (K-dom,K-s = 10(22.8+/-0.1) and 10(23.2+/-0.1) M-1), resulting in mercury(II) binding by the DOM at low mercury(II) concentrations. The magnitude of the strong site binding constant is indicative of mercury(II) interaction with organic thiol functional groups. The conditional binding constants determined for the weak peat sites (K-peat,K-w = 10(11.5+/-0.1) and 10(11.8+/-0.1) M-1) and weak DOM sites (K-dom,K-w = 10(8.7+/-3.0) and 10(7.3+/-4.5) M-1) were indicative of mercury(II) interaction with carboxyl and phenol functional groups.

Storm-induced vertically-mixed CDOM from deeper depths has a higher absorption coefficient than the photochemically degraded CDOM within the undisturbed pre-storm upper mixed layer. Principal findings are: (1) Little variability is observed prior to storm encounter at which time the CDOM-defined wake rapidly develops a notable right side asymmetry. (2) The more robust right-side CDOM absorption coefficient elevation is visible up to similar to30days depending on storm intensity. In a way that is similar to existing sea surface temperature imagery applications, the techniques in this paper are proposed as a complementary new research tool for the study of atmosphere-ocean interactions.																	0094-8276					OCT 1	2002	29	19							1908	10.1029/2002GL015114						WOS:000180603500014		
J	Kim, SB; Corapcioglu, MY				Kim, SB; Corapcioglu, MY			Contaminant transport in riverbank filtration in the presence of dissolved organic matter and bacteria: a kinetic approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In riverbank filtration, the removal of organic contaminants is an important task for the production of good quality drinking water. The transport of an organic contaminant in riverbank filtration can be retarded by sorption on to the solid matrix and facilitated by the presence of mobile colloids. In the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacteria, the subsurface environment can be modeled as a four-phase porous medium: two mobile colloidal phases, an aqueous phase, and a solid matrix. In this study, a kinetic model is developed to simulate the contaminant transport in riverbank filtration in the presence of DOM and bacteria. The bacterial deposition and the contaminant sorption on bacteria and DOM are expressed with kinetic expressions. The model equations are solved numerically with a fully implicit finite difference method. Simulation results show that the contaminant mobility increases greatly in riverbank filtration due to the presence of DOM. The mobility can be enhanced further when the bacteria and DOM are present together in the aquifer. In this system, the total aqueous phase contaminant concentration, C-ct(+) includes the contaminant dissolved in the aqueous phase, C-c(+) the contaminant sorbed to DOM, sigma(cd)(+), and the contaminant sorbed to mobile bacteria, C(b)(+)sigma(cbm)(+),(i.e. C-ct(+) = C-c(+) + sigma(cd)(+) + C-b(+) sigma(cbm)(+)) Sensitivity analysis illustrates that the distribution of the total aqueous phase contaminants among the dissolved phase, DOM and bacteria is changed significantly with various Damkohler numbers related to the contaminant sorption on mobile colloids.

J	Brauner, CJ; Wood, CM				Brauner, CJ; Wood, CM			Effect of long-term silver exposure on survival and ionoregulatory development in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) embryos and larvae, in the presence and absence of added dissolved organic matter	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Developing rainbow trout were chronically exposed to silver (as AgNO3) from fertilization to swim-up, in moderately hard water (120 mg CaCO3 l(-1)) in the presence and absence of an additional 12 mg C/L of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, as humic acid, Aldrich). Nominal silver concentrations were 0, 0.1 and 10 mug l(-1) total silver in a flow-through set-up maintained at 12 degreesC. The objectives of the study were to investigate the possible protective effects of DOC on growth, mortality, time to hatch and swim-up, and sublethal ionoregulatory disturbances during chronic exposure to ionic silver. Throughout development, there was a large increase in % daily mortality at 10 mug l(-1) total silver (in the absence of DOC), that was associated with an ionoregulatory disturbance, in particular a 35% reduction in whole body Na+ just prior to hatch. At nominal 10 mug.l(-1) total silver, the presence of additional DOC (reducing dissolved silver to 4.7+/-0.3 mug l(-1)) resulted in a significant reduction in % daily mortality up to hatch, demonstrating a protective effect of DOC. Interestingly, DOC did not appear to mitigate the ionoregulatory disturbance, with the exception of whole body [Cl-] on day 44 of exposure. Exposure to 0.1 mug.l(-1) total silver (in the absence of DOC) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in growth, and DOC did not prevent an ionoregulatory disturbance [based upon (J(in) Na+), whole body Na+,K+ ATPase activity and whole body (Na+)] at this silver concentration relative to controls+DOC. DOC exerted a direct effect on growth and ionoregulatory development that complicates interpretation of the data, however, these data indicate that protective effects of DOC (in the form of Aldrich humic acid) during chronic silver exposure appear to be less than that observed during acute exposure. The ultimate goal of this and future studies is to develop a model that can predict chronic toxicity on a site-specific basis, taking into account protective effects of various ligands present in different waters, as is presently being employed for some metals during acute exposure.

J	Belzile, C; Gibson, JAE; Vincent, WF				Belzile, C; Gibson, JAE; Vincent, WF			Colored dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic carbon exclusion from lake ice: Implications for irradiance transmission and carbon cycling	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Thick ice cover is a feature of cold-temperate, polar, and alpine lakes and rivers throughout much of the year. Our observations from Canadian takes and rivers across the latitudinal gradient 46-80degreesN show that their overlying ice contains low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) relative to the underlying waters. The CDOM exclusion factor (water/ice) ranged from 1.4 to 114 and was typically greater than twice the exclusion factor for inorganic solutes. Application of synchronous fluorescence analysis to lake ice samples and experimentally frozen lakewater indicated that only less complex, lower molecular weight molecules were retained within the ice. Consistent with this analysis, DOC-specific absorption showed that the DOC in the ice was generally less colored than that in the underlying waters. The reduced CDOM absorption within the ice allowed relatively high ultraviolet (UV) transmission despite the elevated scattering within the ice and resulted in UV diffuse attenuation coefficients up to eight times lower in the ice than in the underlying waters. This relatively low attenuation by the ice would cause organisms trapped near the surface by inverse stratification to experience high UV exposure prior to ice breakup. The ice exclusion effect gives rise to a concentrated zone of CDOM and DOC that is likely to favor heterotrophic and mixotrophic processes and influence biogeochemical interactions.

However, accurate estimates of these variables using standard ocean color algorithms have been difficult due to the complex nature of the light field in these environments. In this study, we process SeaWiFS satellite data using two recently developed algorithms; one for atmospheric correction and the other a semi-. analytic bio-optical algorithm and compare the results with standard SeaWiFS algorithms. Overall, the two algorithms produced more realistic estimates of Chl and CDOM distributions in Florida Shelf and Bay waters. Estimates of surface salinity were obtained from the CDOM absorption field assuming a conservative mixing behavior of these Waters. A comparison of SeaWiFS-derived Chl and CDOM absorption with field measurements in the Florida Bay indicated that although well correlated, CDOM was underestimated, while Chl was overestimated. Bottom reflectance appeared to affect these estimates at the shallow central Bay stations during the winter. These results demonstrate the need for new bio-optical algorithms or tuning of the parameters used in the bio-optical, algorithm for local conditions encountered in the Bay.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													0253-4126					SEP	2002	111	3					197	207								WOS:000177974500003

The source waters, each having significantly different specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)), Molecular weight (MW) distribution and polarity, were fractionated using XAD-8 resin adsorption and ultrafiltration (UF), with good DOM mass balance closures (based on dissolved organic carbon). It was found that such fractionation preserved both the SUVA and the reactivity of the source waters, as demonstrated by statistically similar DBP formation and speciation from chlorinated source water and source waters reconstituted from XAD-8 or UF fractions. In addition, there was no evidence of synergistic effects among DOM components when reacting with chlorine. Consistent trends between DBP yields and MW were not found. Hydrophobic fractions of DOM (isolated by XAD-8) were the most reactive DOM components; however, hydrophilic components also showed appreciable DBP yields, contributing up to 50% of total DBP formation. In contrast, strong and unique correlations were observed between the SUVA of individual fractions and their trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA(9)) yields, confirming that the aromaticity of DOM components is more directly related to reactivity than other physicochemical properties. The finding of a single correlation independent of the fractionation process employed is notable because XAD-8 adsorption and UF fractionate DOM by significantly different mechanisms. These results confirm that SUVA is a distributed parameter that reflects DOM heterogeneity. Therefore, the SUVA distribution within natural water represents an important property that can be used as a reliable predictor of DBP formation. Finally, bromine appears to be more effectively incorporated into low UV-absorbing (i.e., low SUVA), low MW and hydrophilic DOM fractions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Haitzer, M; Aiken, GR; Ryan, JN				Haitzer, M; Aiken, GR; Ryan, JN			Binding of mercury(II) to dissolved organic matter: The role of the mercury-to-DOM concentration ratio	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The binding of Hg(II) to dissolved organic matter (DOM; hydrophobic acids isolated from the Florida Everglades by XAD-8 resin) was measured at a wide range of Hg-to-DOM concentration ratios using an equilibrium dialysis ligand exchange method. Conditional distribution coefficients (K-DOM') determined by this method were strongly affected by the Hg/DOM concentration ratio. At Hg/DOM ratios below approximately 1 mug of Hg/mg of DOM, we observed very strong interactions (K-DOM' = 10(23.2+/-1.0) L kg(-1) at pH = 7.0 and I = 0.1), indicative of mercury-thiol bonds. Hg/DOM ratios above approximately 10 mug of Hg/mg of DOM, as used in most studies that have determined Hg-DOM binding constants, gave much lower K-DOM' values (10(10.7+/-1.0) L kg(-1) at pH = 4.9-5.6 and I = 0.1), consistent with Hg binding mainly to oxygen functional groups. These results suggest that the binding of Hg to DOM under natural conditions (very low Hg/DOM ratios) is controlled by a small fraction of DOM molecules containing a reactive thiol functional group. Therefore, Hg/DOM distribution coefficients used for modeling the biogeochemical behavior of Hg in natural systems need to be determined at low Hg/DOM ratios.

The measuring principle is based on the direct determination of the oxygen concentration change resulting from photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds. One of the two oxygen electrodes, the reference oxygen electrode, was utilized to measure the reference signal responding only to oxygen present in the injected samples. Oxygen consumption due to the TiO2-catalyzed photochemical oxidation of organic compounds in samples was monitored with the working oxygen electrode. The COD value of this sensor was calculated as the difference of the currents at reference and working oxygen electrodes, respectively. The operation characteristics of the sensor are demonstrated using artificially treated wastewater as a substrate. The sensor was also applied to the determination of COD in real water samples from dam reservoirs (n = 20) all over Japan. The results were in good agreement with those from the conventional COD methods (i.e., permanganate and dichromate methods).

J	Reynolds, DM				Reynolds, DM			The differentiation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable dissolved organic matter in wastewaters using fluorescence spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												The chemical and biochemical oxygen demand values of a number of synthetic and wastewater samples were determined using fluorescence spectroscopy. Treated and untreated sewage samples were obtained from a local sewage treatment works while synthetic samples were analysed before, during, and after treatment via a rotating biodisc contactor. Fluorescence intensities were normalised using the water Raman signal as an internal standard and corrections applied to take into account the attenuation effects caused by the sample matrix. The fluorescence emission spectra (lambda(exc) = 280nm) of synthetic and sewage samples were very similar in that two main fluorescence bands centred around 350nm and 440nm were observed in all samples. Normalised fluorescence data, centred at 350nm, correlate well with corresponding BOD, COD and TOC values (R-2 values ranging between 0.93 and 0.98). Using BOD, COD and TOC data the fluorescence at 350nm and 440nm can be apportioned to biodegradable and non-biodegradable dissolved organic matter respectively. The findings of this research show that fluorescence data can be used to quantify oxygen demand values (chemical and biochemical) and total organic carbon values. Furthermore, the fluorescence spectral response can be apportioned to biodegradable (BOD) and non-biodegradable (COD - BOD) dissolved organic matter. The potential of using fluorescence spectroscopy as a possible tool for real-time monitoring of sewage wastes is discussed.

It was studied how the increase of the dissolved HM concentration affects the equilibrium partitioning of PCP between the solid sediment matter and dissolved HM. The lake sedimentary and dissolved HM were isolated and their structural compositions were compared with elemental analyses, solid-sate C-13 NMR spectroscopy and degradative analyses by pyrolysis - GC/MS. At the beginning of the equilibrium experiment, the PCP contaminant (200 mug l(-1)) was added into the water-sediment slurry system having an initial dissolved HM concentration. After 35 days, the system has reached an equilibrium and 75.5% of PCP was bound to the total solid sediment, 1.5% to dissolved HM and 23.0% remained free in water. The dissolved HM content was increased by 150% and, at the second equilibrium state after 91 days, only 63.8% of PCP was bound to the total sediment, and even 6.5% to the dissolved HM and 29.7% was free. The structural analyses indicated that the contents of aliphatics, aromatics and carboxylic carbons are lower in sediment than in dissolved HM, the content of carbohydrates in turn is higher in sediment than in dissolved HM, as well as that of different protein descriptors. The closely related partition coefficients for the sediment and dissolved HM, however, implied that the structural dissimilarity of these sorbents does not play so strong roles in the binding affinity of PCP as it would be postulated. The relatively great sorption coefficient of the minor colloid-like particle fraction in water implied its special but quantitatively quite immaterial roles in the partitioning cycle of PCP.

Py-GC/MS fingerprinting was used in this research to lend insight into the complex subsurface hydrology of a permafrost-dominated watershed near Fairbanks, AK. Fingerprinting analysis was conducted on groundwater, artesian spring, and stream samples from two watersheds and used to characterize relationships between the individual samples and between the watersheds. Fingerprinting analyses supported the hypothesis that spring water emerging on opposite sides of a hydraulic divide was of the same origin. Results also supported the hypothesis that individual water samples and their probable origin could be distinguished from one another based on their DOM fingerprint alone. This type of analysis could be used for flow path characterization in other complex watersheds or for characterizing important properties of DOM, such as its potential to mobilize contaminants.

J	Del Vecchio, R; Blough, NV				Del Vecchio, R; Blough, NV			Photobleaching of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in natural waters: kinetics and modeling	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The effects of monochromatic and polychromatic UV and visible (VIS) radiation on the optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were examined for a Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) standard and for water from the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. The primary (direct) loss of absorption and fluorescence occurred at the irradiation wavelength(s), with smaller secondary (indirect) losses occurring outside the irradiation wavelength(s). The efficiency of both direct and indirect photobleaching decreased monotonically with increasing wavelength. Exposure to polychromatic light increased the CDOM absorption spectral slope (S), consistent with previous field measurements. An analysis of the monochromatic photobleaching kinetics argues that a model based on a simple superposition of multiple chromophores undergoing independent photobleaching cannot apply: this conclusion further implies that the absorption spectrum of CDOM cannot arise solely from a simple superposition of the spectra of numerous independent chromophores. The kinetics of CDOM absorption loss with the monochromatic irradiation were employed to create a simple, heuristic model of photobleaching. This model allowed us to examine the importance of the indirect photobleaching losses in determining the overall photobleaching rates as well as to model the photobleaching of natural waters under polychromatic light fields. Application of this model to natural waters closely predicted the change in the CDOM spectral shape caused by photodegradation. The time scale of this process was consistent with field observations acquired during the summertime for coastal waters in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). The results indicate that the ratio of the photodegradation depth to the mixed layer depth is a key parameter controlling the rate of the photobleaching in surface waters.

Comparison of riverine organic matter from the Piracicaba River basin, a region where rivers and streams receive urban sewage and industrial effluents, with data reported for the pristine Amazon system revealed significant differences associated with anthropogenic impacts. One important difference was N enrichment in the particulate organic material of the Piracicaba basin rivers, due to (a) urban and industrial effluents, and (b) enhanced phytoplankton growth, which results from the combination of nutrient enrichment and damming of sections of the rivers. Radiocarbon concentrations were overall more depleted (older C-14 age) in the Piracicaba basin rivers than in the Amazon, which may reflect the importance of soil erosion in the former. Analyses of stable and radioactive carbon isotopes and lignin-derived compounds indicated that coarse particulate organic material is composed of a mixture of soil particles and degraded organic matter from C3 and C4 vascular plants.

J	Shen, YH				Shen, YH			Removal of dissolved organic matter from water by adsorption-flocculation using organobentonite	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Bentonite modified with short chain cationic surfactant might be the basis of a new approach to removing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from water. The treatment process involves dispersing bentonite to the DOM-containing water and then adding a small cationic surfactant to result in flocs which are agglomerates of organobentonite and bound DOM. The flocs are then removed from the solution by sedimentation Experimental results indicate that Benzyltrimethylammonium bromide (BTMA)-bentonite displays a high affinity for DOM, most likely due to aromatic groups in the DOM molecule interacting with the benzene ring in the BTMA ion through increased pi-pi type interactions. Under appropriate operating conditions, 75% DOM removal and nearly 100% bentonite recovery could be achieved by the adsorption-flocculation process using BTMA-bentonite. Additionally, the rapid adsorption kinetics made adsorption-flocculation with BTMA-bentonite attractive for continuous treatment of large volumes of raw water. The bentonite may function as a recyclable surfactant medium for the adsorption and subsequent combustion of organic pollutants.																	0959-3330					MAY	2002	23	5					553	560		10.1080/09593332308618391						WOS:000176238900007	12088378

Predicted distributions of nitrate and dissolved inorganic carbon were similar between the two runs. Export fluxes to the deep ocean were dominated by sinking particles in both instances, and so showed little sensitivity to the choice of whether or not an explicit representation of DOM is chosen. Significant differences did however occur in predicted primary production and f-ratio, giving rise to alkalinity changes (up to 22 mmol m(-3)) which could be important when calculating pCO(2) and atmospheric exchange of CO2 in studies addressing the global carbon cycle.

The region studied was the Shark River and Florida Bay in Everglades National Park in Southwestern Florida. Samples were taken from the fresh waters at the head of the Shark River, the mouth of the river, and in the fresh-water river plume as it mixed into the saline waters of Florida Bay. The salinity varied from 0.47 at the head of the river to 36.0 for this series of I I samples. Steady-state fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing salinity from the head of the Shark River into Florida Bay. This is due to dilution by mixing, as changes in the fluorescence intensity also correlated with changes in the levels of total organic carbon (TOC). Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed on the five most concentrated samples (salinity from 0.47 to 30.5). The decay of the time-resolved fluorescence could be reasonably fit to a multi-exponential function, with three lifetime components on the order of 0.5-0.8, 2-3, and 6-9 its. These ranges are in agreement with previous literature results for humic acids, fulvic acids, and marine CDOM concentrated by ultrafiltration. This is the first study of CDOM fluorescence lifetimes in coastal waters in a fresh to marine transition zone. Although photochemical and biological transformations of CDOM occur in these zones, no statistically significant difference in lifetimes was observed with increasing salinity. However, irradiating fresh water samples from the head of the Shark River at 280 and 334 nm resulted in a significant decrease in the two shorter lifetime components (by a factor of similar to 4), but only a slight decrease in the longest lifetime component.

The experimental approach used for this study consisted of in situ incubations of radiolabeled glutamic acid ((14)C-Glu), followed by a sequential extraction allowing the quantification of the radioactivity associated to different chemical fractions, representative of different biogeochemical processes. This technique was devised to simulate the fate of simple dissolved compounds resulting from the degradation of particulate organic matter near the seafloor. In our experiment the substrate underwent both biotic (mineralization, bacterial incorporation) and abiotic (geopolymerization) transformations. Significant spatial variations were put in relation with sediment characteristics (e.g. fine-errained fraction, Eh, CaCO(3) contents) and biological activities, such as bacterial respiration and infaunal bur-rowing. Biologically mediated processes decreased from onshore to deep sites. with mineralization always accounting for the bulk of transformations of the injected (14)C-Glu. Geopolymerization did not display a clear spatial trend and appeared to be a quantitatively important process on the Gulf of Lions margin.

Fulvic (FA) and humic (HA) acids, dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water, as well as organic matter in whole soils (SOM) of different horizons were investigated. The proposed methodology comprised extraction by dichloromethane/acetone and derivatization with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and library searches. The C-10:0 to C-34:0 methyl esters of n-alkyl fatty acids were used as external standards for calibration. The total concentrations Of C-14:0 to C-28:0 n-alkyl fatty acids were determined in DOM obtained by reverse-osmosis of Suwannee river water (309.3 mug g(-1)), in freeze-dried brown lake water (180.6 mug g(-1)), its DOM concentrate (93.0 mug g(-1)), humic acid (43.1 mug g(-1)) and fulvic acid (42.5 mug g(-1)). The concentrations of the methylated fatty acids (n-C16:0 to 12-C28:0) were significantly (r(2) = 0.9999) correlated with the proportions of marker signals (% total ion intensity (TII), m/z 256 to m/z 508) in the corresponding pyrolysis-field ionization (FI) mass spectra. The concentrations of terrestrial C-10:0 to C-34:0 n-alkyl fatty acids from four soil samples ranged from 0.02 mug g(-1) to 11 mug g(-1). The total concentrations of the extractable fatty acids were quantified from a Podzol Bh horizon (26.2 mug g(-1)), Phaeozem Ap unfertilized (48.1 mug g(-1)), Phaeozem Ap fertilized (57.7 mug g(-1)) and Gleysol Ap (66.7 mug g(-1)). Our results demonstrate that the method is well suited to investigate the role of long-chain fatty acids in humic fractions, whole soils and their particle-size fractions and can be serve for the differentiation of plant growth and soil management.																	1436-8730					APR	2002	165	2					133	139		10.1002/1522-2624(200204)165:2<133::AID-JPLN133>3.0.CO;2-T						WOS:000175399600003

We separated untreated and treated effluents by ultrafiltration into three fractions with molecular masses <500 Da, between 500 and 3000 Da, and >3000 Da to study the contribution of each fraction to whole effluent values before and after treatment. Untreated TCF effluent presented 3.75 times as much BOD and 2.4 times as much COD as ECF effluent. Over a six week treatment period, BOD removal was similar for both effluents (>97%). However, COD removal was greater in TCF (77%-85%) than in ECF (47%-68%) effluent, attributed largely to the removal of high molecular mass organic matter, which represented a significant fraction of TCF effluent but not ECF effluent. Microtox toxicity was consistently eliminated from both effluents, whereas chronic toxicity to algae was reduced but not removed during treatment. Effluent toxicity was not correlated with BOD, COD, or AOX levels. TCF effluent contained more readily removable high molecular mass organic matter than ECF effluent. Removal efficiency was not simply a function of organic matter molecular mass, but also of the nature of the dissolved organic matter. The ECF effluent fraction of intermediate molecular mass was the most highly chlorinated and presented the lowest removal efficiency. Application: Knowing how effluent composition affects treatment efficiency can help mills manage their treatment systems in ways that avoid treatment efficiency loss after mill process changes.																	0734-1415					APR	2002	1	2					26	32								WOS:000178465400006		
J	Middelboe, M; Lyck, PG				Middelboe, M; Lyck, PG			Regeneration of dissolved organic matter by viral lysis in marine microbial communities	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The influence of viruses on bacterial net growth and respiration was investigated in batch cultures with natural assemblages of marine bacterioplankton, which were manipulated with respect to abundance of natural virioplankton. In 1 set of cultures (-virus), a virus-free water sample (0.02 mum filtered) was inoculated with a bacterioplankton concentrate, and in a parallel set of cultures (control) a virus-containing water sample (0.2 mum filtered) was inoculated with the bacterioplankton concentrate, The 0.02 mum filtration procedure reduced viral abundance by 62 to 92 % in the -virus cultures relative to the parallel control cultures with the natural density of viruses (i.e. the fraction of natural viruses <0.2 mum). This approach allowed us to examine the effects of reduced viral densities on the production of natural assemblages of bacteria and viruses and on the distribution of added (3)H-thymidine into size fractions (the bacterial size fraction, viral size fraction, dissolved size fraction and respired fraction). The results showed significantly higher bacterial net growth and growth efficiency in cultures with a reduced abundance of viruses relative to control cultures with natural viral abundance, and indicated viral regulation of bacterial abundance in the control cultures. We suggest that viral lysis significantly affected the bacterial carbon cycling in the cultures by liberating a fraction of the organic matter already taken up by the bacteria, thus stimulating recycling of bacterial carbon and reducing the net bacterial production, The implications of such regeneration of dissolved organic matter by viral lysis for pelagic carbon cycling and for measurements of bacterial production are discussed.

The distribution of the organic matter in the particulate, colloidal and truly dissolved pools along the salinity gradient was characterized at both global and molecular levels using biochemical parameters. The distribution of particulate organic carbon (POC) paralleled that of total suspended matter in winter, whereas decoupling was observed in spring, reflecting active biological mechanisms in the mixing zone off the Sulina branch during this period. This is supported by distribution patterns of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and branched fatty acids (BrFA), which are indicators of phytoplankton and bacteria activities, respectively. The delta(13)C isotopic signature of POC in the Danube-Black Sea mixing zone varied of between -29.1 and -24.6parts per thousand, which is consistent with the usual temperate range of estuarine systems. In spring, the observed shift towards lower values in the area of salinity 0-5 suggested a gradual change in the composition of POC, such as that caused by cell lysis of riverine planktonic populations induced by a salinity increase. A subsequent increase of delta(13)C values towards higher salinities indicated phytoplankton growth in the estuarine/marine zone, as assessed by high concentrations of PUFA. Indirect evidence of sedimentation of terrestrial particles in the upper part of the salinity gradient in the range of 2-3 was suggested by the decrease of die content of particles and POC in fatty acids (C(24)-C(32)) and n-alkanes (C(25)-C(35)), both constituents of cuticular waxes of higher plants. A tight coupling was suggested between phytoplankton and bacteria by similar distributions of PUFA and BrFA along the salinity gradient. The distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied according to the season. In spring, the DOC concentrations remained constant across the salinity gradient in front of the Sulina branch at about 2.7 mg 1(-1), whereas higher concentrations, >4 mg 1(-1), were observed in winter at stations located in the low salinity (2-4 and 5-8) area. A few data were obtained for delta(13)C of the DOC pool, with an average of -26.9%. in the Danube River end-member and values close to those of POC off the various branches. The low molecular weight (LMW) fraction of DOC isolated from water by sequential cross-filtration was evaluated by summing the pool of the combined and free amino acids and that of the combined and free carbohydrates. The distribution of LMW DOC along the salinity gradient was similar in the three investigated areas. Off the Sulina branch, proportions of LMW DOC fluctuated between 17 and 37parts per thousand in winter and between 23 and 35parts per thousand in spring. Two zones of high LMW DOC were located in two ranges of salinity-between 2 and 4 and between 5 and 8-probably originating from the release of decaying diatoms, assessed by high molecular proportions of serine in the combined amino acids. LMW DOC indicated a high potential for microbal activity, as shown by concomitant distributions of branched fatty acids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of all samples show a high degree of similarity, with major contributions from carbohydrates, bound acetate, and lipids. Molecular level analyses of neutral sugars show seven monosaccharides, rhamnose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose, and galactose, to be abundant, and to occur in comparable relative amounts in each sample. Previous studies have emphasized the distinctive composition of dissolved humic substances in fresh and marine waters, and have attributed these differences to sources and transformations of organic matter unique to each environment. In contrast we find a large fraction of freshwater high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM; > 1 kD) to be indistinguishable from marine HMWDOM in bulk and molecular-level chemical properties. Aquatic HMWDOM is similar in chemical composition to biologically derived acylated heteropolysaccharides isolated from marine algal cultures, suggesting a biological source for some fraction of persistent HMWDOM. High molecular weight DOC contributes 51 +/- 26% of the total DOC, and monosaccharides 18 +/- 8% of the total HMWDOC in our freshwater samples. These contributions are on average higher and more variable, but not significantly different than for surface seawater (30% and 16% respectively), Biogeochemical processes that produce, accumulate, and recycle DOM may therefore share important similarities and be broadly comparable across a range of environmental settings.

J	Williams, CF; Letey, J; Farmer, WJ				Williams, CF; Letey, J; Farmer, WJ			Molecular weight of dissolved organic matter-napropamide complex transported through soil columns	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Soil-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been shown to form stable complexes with the herbicide napropamide [2-(alpha-naphthoxy-N,N-diethylpropionamide] capable of enhancing the transport of napropamide through soil columns. Two soils, one containing sewage sludge-derived organic matter (SS) and the other having only natural organic matter (NoSS) were treated with napropamide and allowed to dry to promote complex formation. Soil columns were prepared by packing a 10-cm layer of untreated, dry, sieved soil followed by an overlying 5-cm layer of napropamide-treated soil. Columns were irrigated and the effluent collected and placed in dialysis chambers. After equilibration napropamide concentrations were determined on both sides of the membrane and complex and quantified based on the amount of napropamide unable to cross the membrane. It was found that for the SS soil 7% and for the NoSS 2.4% of the applied napropamide underwent facilitated transport. In addition, most of the complex transported through the columns had a molecular weight between 500 and 1000 Daltons (Da). The solutions from the SS soil were also found to have formed at least two distinct complexes that were resolved after passing through the untreated soil layer. The results obtained were in agreement with other published results and the techniques used offer a way to separate and concentrate DOM complexes from column effluents for further characterization.																	0047-2425					MAR-APR	2002	31	2					619	627								WOS:000174330600031	11931454	
J	Ohno, T				Ohno, T			Fluorescence inner-filtering correction for determining the humification index of dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The use of fluorescence spectrometry has been suggested as a simple method to determine the extent of natural organic matter humification by quantifying the red-shifting of fluorescence emission that occurs with increasing humification. Humification indices are calculated by dividing fluorescence intensity at longer wavelengths by intensity at shorter wavelengths. These indices calculated without any specific efforts to standardize dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration will result in index values that vary with DOM concentration due to fluorescence inner-filtering effects. This study critically evaluated the effect of DOM concentration on humification index determination using organic matter isolated from field corn extract, soil: water extract, and soil fulvic acid. The results show that humification index values are sensitive to DOM concentration of the solution and are linear with respect to transmittance of the solution at the 254 nm used as the excitation wavelength. An approximate correction for DOM is to exploit the linear nature of the regression fit and to determine index values at the extrapolated 100% transmittance value. An exact correction using explicit correction factors for both primary and secondary inner-filtration effects was shown to give humification index values that are concentration invariant when absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was less than approximately 0.3 unit. Defining the humification index as the fluorescence intensity in the 300-->345 nm region divided by the sum of intensity in the 300-->345 nm and 435-->480 nm regions was statistically advantageous. This study suggests that for quantitative results which can be used to compare humification of natural organic matter across different studies, correction of the fluorescence emission spectra for inner-filtration effects is needed.																	0013-936X					FEB 15	2002	36	4					742	746		10.1021/es0155276						WOS:000173919000032	11878392	
J	Imai, A; Fukushima, T; Matsushige, K; Kim, YH; Choi, K				Imai, A; Fukushima, T; Matsushige, K; Kim, YH; Choi, K			Characterization of dissolved organic matter in effluents from wastewater treatment plants	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in effluents from sewage and human-wastes treatment plants (STPEs and HWTPEs) was fractionated using resin adsorbents into six classes: aquatic humic substances (AHS), hydrophobic bases (HoB), hydrophobic neutrals (HoN), hydrophilic acids (HiA), hydrophilic bases (HiB), and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). DOM-fraction distribution varied substantially depending on the kind of wastewater and the type of treatment process. AHS and HiA dominated in all effluents. collectively accounting for more than 55% of the DOM measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In particular, HiA were the most abundant fraction in the effluents, constituting 32-74% of the DOM. AHS appeared to be the second most dominant fraction and varied considerably. accounting for 3-28% of the DOM. The HoN fraction also varied from 0-21%. AHS, HoN, and HiA were the fractions that changed substantially and differed characteristically among the samples studied. The ratios of ultraviolet absorbance to DOC (UV : DOC ratio) in all effluents exhibited a common relationship: AHS > total DOM > HiA. Nevertheless, the ratios were substantially different between STPEs and HWTPEs and among HWTPEs. For HWTPEs, the effluent from the chemical coagulation process had the highest UV: DOC ratios. On the other hand, the effluent from the ultrafiltration and activated carbon adsorption processes had the lowest ratios. Molecular size distribution of the effluents was determined by size exclusion chromatography and found to exhibit a relatively narrow size range and low weight-averaged molecular weights ranging from 380 to 830 g mol(-1).

Concentration losses were 33-50% after 12 days of exposure to 69 W m(-2) artificial PAR and 16 W m(-2) UV radiation. Natural, unshaded mid-day solar radiation in the region (68degreesN 18degreesE) during the month of june is 159 W m(-2) for PAR. In contrast to microbial organic carbon removal, TOC exponentially decreased upon radiation, which suggests that TOC is more rapidly oxidized by light than by ambient microbes. Further, rapid decline in TOC concentration implies the presence of a dominant pool of photo-labile compounds (p > 95%). A measured mass balance for carbon identified 50-75% of the degraded TOC as carbon dioxide after 12 days of exposure to light. The observed conversion of organic to inorganic carbon was accompanied by increases in pH and alkalinity, suggesting that photo-degradation of NOM potentially contributes to in-stream buffering capacity. The remaining refractory TOC changed in chemical character, including an altered molecular weight distribution with decreased average weight and a change in the proportions of humics as evidenced by absorbance ratios (A(254)/A(420)). Extrapolation of the experiment to natural headwater conditions show that photo-degradation is an important in-stream process that should be considered in calculations of carbon turnover in surface waters because of its influence on both TOC amount and character.

J	Klug, JL				Klug, JL			Positive and negative effects of allochthonous dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients on phytoplankton growth	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can have both positive and negative effects on phytoplankton growth. The magnitude of these effects may vary depending on the source of DOM and the composition of the phytoplankton community. Here, I address the relative importance of the positive and negative effects of DOM extracts on phytoplankton growth. In short-term experiments with phytoplankton from West Long Lake, a small, moderately coloured lake in northern Michigan, U.S.A., the net effect of doubling ambient DOM on phytoplankton growth was positive. Increasing DOM concentrations from similar to10 mg C.L-1 to similar to20 mg C.L-1 had a negative effect on total phytoplankton growth by reducing irradiance and thus reducing the depth to which growth was positive. However, inorganic nutrients in the DOM extracts increased growth at each irradiance level. The positive effect on phytoplankton growth owing to the nutrients associated with DOM was greater than the negative effect caused by shading. Although the positive effects of allochthonous DOM inputs outweighed the negative effects for the nutrient-limited phytoplankton in these experiments, the net effect depends on the concentration and availability of nutrients associated with allochthonous DOM as well as the physiological status of the phytoplankton community.																	0706-652X					JAN	2002	59	1					85	95		10.1139/F01-194						WOS:000174022200010

These concern dissolved and colloidal organic carbon, free amino acids and total dissolved carbohydrates and heterotrophic activity. Main factors controlling organic matter degradation, resulting from laboratory tests not planned in the above project, are also discussed. Dissolved organic matter shows seasonal accumulation, which may be markedly different from year to year, and large contributions by colloidal and saccharide components. Heterotrophic activities play an important role in the carbon cycle, although laboratory runs highlight limitations caused by aging of organic matter and phosphorus deficiency.

J	Aluwihare, LI; Repeta, DJ; Chen, RF				Aluwihare, LI; Repeta, DJ; Chen, RF			Chemical composition and cycling of dissolved organic matter in the Mid-Atlantic Bight	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												This study focuses on the chemical characterization of high molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW DOM) isolated from the Middle Atlantic Bight in April 1994 and March 1996. Using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((HNMR)-H-1) and monosaccharide analysis we compared both spatial and temporal variations in the chemical structure of HMW DOM across this region. Our analyses support the presence of at least two compositionally distinct components to HMW DOM. The major component is acyl polysaccharide (APS), a biopolymer rich in carbohydrates, acetate and lipid, accounting for between 50% and 80% of the total high molecular-weight dissolved organic carbon (HMW DOC) in surface samples. APS is most abundant in fully marine, surface-water samples, and is a product of autochthonous production. Organic matter with spectral properties characteristic of humic substances is the second major component of HMW DOM. Humic substances are most abundant (up to 49% of the total carbon) in samples collected from estuaries, near the coast, and in deep water, suggesting both marine and perhaps terrestrial sources. Radiocarbon analyses of neutral monosaccharides released by the hydrolysis of APS have similar and modern (average 71parts per thousand) Delta(14)C values. Radiocarbon data support our suggestion that these sugars occur as part of a common macromolecule, with an origin via recent biosynthesis. Preliminary radiocarbon data for total neutral monosaccharides isolated from APS at 300 and 750m show this fraction to be substantially enriched relative to total HMW DOC and DOC. The relatively enriched radiocarbon values of APS at depth suggest APS is rapidly transported into the deep ocean. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

An attempt at a "mass" balance of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) on the shelf suggests that more FDOM is present during the spring than during the summer and that deficits during the summer are due to photodegradation. However, subsurface production of FDOM was also prevalent during the summer. These processes were observed due to high shelf productivity and a stable water column that isolates a "cold pool" below sunlit surface waters. Rivers contributed about 10% of the total FDOM to the shelf with the majority of FDOM being advected onto the shelf from slope waters. Net production of FDOM was observed in the spring while net degradation of FDOM was observed in the summer. The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter appears to be a useful measurement for better understanding dissolved organic carbon dynamics as well as ocean optics in ocean margins.

J	Hopkinson, CS; Vallino, JJ; Nolin, A				Hopkinson, CS; Vallino, JJ; Nolin, A			Decomposition of dissolved organic matter from the continental margin	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Decomposition of dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (DOC, DON, DOP) was measured for surface and bottom waters of the middle Atlantic bight (MAB) and deep slope water adjacent to the MAB on two occasions in March and August 1996. We used standard bottle incubation techniques to measure the decrease in dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations over a 180-day interval. Generally DOM concentrations in the MAB were elevated (125 muM DOC, 10.2 muM DON and 0.30 muM DOP) relative to the surface ocean and deep slope water (46.7 muM DOC, 2.76 muM DON, 0.03 muM DOP). On average the C:N:P ratio of shelf DOM (431:36: 1) was substantially higher than the Redfield ratio, but not nearly as high for that of deep slope water (2700:215: 1). Decomposition time course data were fit to a three-pool (very labile, labile, and recalcitrant pools) multi-G model using a Marquardt fitting routine. The three-pool model was superior to a simple exponential decay model assuming a single pool of DOM. We observed no significant changes in concentration of DOM in deep-water samples, attesting to the old age of this material, its recalcitrant nature, and the cleanliness of our technique for measuring decomposition. There were major differences in the relative amount of very labile, labile and recalcitrant fractions of shelf-water DOC, DON and DOP as a result of preferential remineralization of P over N and N over C. Averaged over stations, the decomposable portion of the bulk DOC, DON and DOP pools increased from 30% to 40% to 81% for C, N and P. There was a wide range in decay coefficients for the very labile and labile DOM pools: average decay coefficient for the very labile pool was 0.219 d(-1), and 0.018 d(-1) for the labile pool. Average half-lives calculated from the decay coefficients were 4, 12 and 8 days for the very labile DOC, DON and DOP pools, and 54,113 and 90 days for the labile DOC, DON and DOP pools. On the basis of pool turnover times relative to shelf-water residence time (similar to 100 days) we conclude that autochthonous algal production is the source of the very labile DOM pools. Its rate of production is sufficient to sustain estimated rates of bacteria C demand in continental margins. Our results for the MAB indicate that while substantial amounts of DOM are remineralized in the same time frame as shelf-water residence time, there is substantial DOM remaining that is depleted in N and P relative to C. Strong concentration gradients in DOM occur between shelf and ocean waters and between surface and deeper waters. Coupled with appropriate vertical and horizontal advective and eddy diffusive transports, DOM export from the MAB and other shelf systems may be a significant component of ocean C dynamics.

The method is based on the neutralization of the electrostatic charge of the humate-metal complexes with a positively charged surfactant in a high ionic strength solution environment. The resulting complexes are conveniently solubilized in the micelles of a non-ionic surfactant medium and are thus separated from the bulk aqueous phase. Free metal species are also determined by complexation with a conventional chelating agent under mild conditions. The overall procedure is easy, rapid and allows for a high sample throughput in terms of massive analysis of many samples in the same time period. The method offers substantially low detection limits of 8.5 and 0.9 mug l(-1) for bound and labile species respectively, with a calibration curve rectilinear in the wide range 40-150 mug l(-1) for the humate associated and 4-40 mug l(-1) for the free metal species. The method is free from interferences yielding recoveries in the range 97-102% for various samples of different matrixes.

J	Church, MJ; Ducklow, HW; Karl, DM				Church, MJ; Ducklow, HW; Karl, DM			Multiyear increases in dissolved organic matter inventories at station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The inventories and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the surface water at Station ALOHA were analyzed from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) data set for the period 1989-1999. Euphotic zone, depth-integrated (0-175 m) concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP) were temporally variable. In particular, during the period 1993-1999, concentrations of DOC and DON increased while inventories of DOP remained unchanged. DOC inventories increased by 303 mmol C m(-2) yr(-1), a value equivalent to approximately 2% of measured primary production (C-14 method) at this site. DON increased at 11 mmol N m(-2) yr(-1), resulting in a mean molar DOC : DON ratio of 27.5 for the accumulated DOM. Accumulation of DOC and DON without corresponding accumulation of DOP resulted in changes to the bulk organic C : N : P stoichiometry; bulk DOC : DOP ratios increased 16% and DON: DOP ratios increased by 17%. These results indicate that a small fraction of the annually produced organic matter escaped biological utilization on time scales of months to years. More importantly, the accumulated DOM inventories grew progressively enriched in C and N relative to P. Fundamental changes in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) habitat appear to have altered microbial processes that regulate organic matter fluxes. Considered together, the long-term increases in DOC and DON inventories are consistent with previous observations, indicating that a recent reorganization of plankton community dynamics may have altered organic matter cycling in this ecosystem.																	0024-3590					JAN	2002	47	1					1	10								WOS:000173529200001		
J	Rochelle-Newall, EJ; Fisher, TR				Rochelle-Newall, EJ; Fisher, TR			Production of chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence in marine and estuarine environments: an investigation into the role of phytoplankton	MARINE CHEMISTRY												We tested whether phytoplankton are a direct source of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence in a series of experiments. In the first experiment, sonication of 11 dense algal cultures from several algal classes revealed no immediate release of CDOM fluorescence. In a second experiment, using nutrient addition bioassays from a range of sites in the mid-Atlantic region, we found no increase in CDOM fluorescence when nutrient limitation was alleviated despite large increases in chlorophyll a over 3-5 days. In a third experiment, the change in CDOM fluorescence over a 28-day period in five non-axenic algal batch cultures was measured. There was little or no increase in CDOM fluorescence until the cultures entered the stationary phase, whereupon an exponential increase in CDOM fluorescence was observed. In a fourth set of experiments, the production of CDOM fluorescence was examined in a series of cultures of Skeletonema costatum and Prorocentrum minimum. In the dark, in the absence of autotrophic growth, we observed slow rates of CDOM fluorescence production (0.02-0.05 NF1U day(-1)). Rates were much higher in parallel lighted cultures (0.1-0.2 NF1U day(-1)) but were more related to bacterial counts than to algal biomass. In a third phase of this experiment, when illuminated, stationary phase cultures were filtered through 1-mum pore size filters and incubated in the dark, CDOM fluorescence production continued unchanged. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that phytoplankton are not a direct source of CDOM fluorescence in marine and estuarine environments and that CDOM fluorescence is produced by bacteria using non-fluorescent organic matter derived from phytoplankton.

J	Rochelle-Newall, EJ; Fisher, TR				Rochelle-Newall, EJ; Fisher, TR			Chromophoric dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic carbon in Chesapeake Bay	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is the light absorbing fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The optical properties of CDOM potentially permit remote sensing of DOC and CDOM, and correction for CDOM absorption is essential for remote sensing of chlorophyll a (chl a) in coastal and estuarine waters. To provide data for this purpose, we report the distributions of CDOM, DOC, and chl a from seven cruises in Chesapeake Bay in 1994-1997. We observed non-conservative distributions of chl a and DOC in half of the cruises, indicating net accumulations within the estuary; however, there were no net accumulations or losses of CDOM, measured as absorption at 355 nm or as fluorescence. Freshwater end member CDOM absorption varied from 2.2 to 4.1 m(-1). Coastal end member CDOM absorption was considerably lower, ranging over 0.4-1.1 m(-1). The fluorescence/absorption ratio was similar to those reported elsewhere for estuarine and coastal waters; however, in the lower salinity/high CDOM region of the Bay, the relationship was not constant, suggestive of the mixing of two or more CDOM sources. Chl a was not correlated with the absorption for most of the cruises nor for the data set as a whole; however, CDOM and DOC were significantly correlated, with two groups evident in the data. The first group had high CDOM concentrations per unit DOC and corresponded to the conservative DOC values observed in the transects. The second group had lower CDOM concentrations per unit DOC and corresponded to the non-conservative DOC values associated with net DOC accumulation near the chl a maximum on the salinity gradient. This indicates the production of nonchromophoric DOC in the region of the chl a maximum of Chesapeake Bay. In terms of remote sensing, these data show that (1) the retrieval of the absorption coefficient of CDOM from fluorescence measurements in the Bay must consider the variability of the fluorescence/absorption relationship, and (2) estimates of DOC acquired from CDOM absorption will underestimate DOC in regions with recent, net accumulations of DOC.

Absorption at 440 nm (a(g)440) ranged between close to zero and 10 m(-1), and the slope of the semilogarithmic absorption spectrum over a minimum range of 400 to 440 nm (s440) ranged between < 0.01 and 0.04 nm(-1). NO relationship was found between a(g)440 or s440 and salinity. Except in the southern Baltic, s440 was found to have abroad distribution (0.0165 +/- 0.0035), suggesting that it should be introduced as an additional variable in bio-optical models when a(g)440 is large. An alternative model for CDOM absorption was applied to available high quality UV-visible absorption spectra from the Wisla river (Poland). This model assumes that, the CDOM absorption spectrum comprises distinct Gaussian absorption bands in the UV, similar to those of benzene. Five bands were fit to the data. The mean central energy of all hands was higher in early summer (E &SIM;7.2, 6.6, 6.4, 6.2 and 5.5 eV or 172, 188, 194, 200 and 226 nm)) than in winter. The higher energy bands were found to decay in both height and width with increasing salinity, while lower energy bands broadened with increasing salinity. 8440 was found to be correlated with shape parameters of the bands centred at 6.4 and 5.5 eV. While the exponential model is convenient for optical modelling and remote sensing applications, these results suggest that the Gaussian model offers a deeper understanding of chemical interactions affecting CDOM molecular structure.

These three techniques were used to obtain different patterns for marine and fresh waters, thus confirming that the organic materials they contain are different. The HPLC fractionation allowed the separation of different classes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) components. Their further analyses using both 3D spectrofluorometry and CE demonstrated that the isolated fractions were specific of the water origin. Furthermore, capillary electrophoresis was shown to have a considerable potential for fingerprinting and for a better characterisation of DOM of different origins. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Aqueous extracts of municipal solid waste composts were fractionated by flocculation with alum (Al-2(SO4)(3).18H(2)O), similar to the flocculation process used in water treatment. Flocculation curves of diluted compost extracts (100 mg/l DOM-carbon) were characterized by an initial rapid decrease in DOM-carbon content and UV absorbance at a relatively low alum dosage, then by a slow gradual decrease at increasing alum dosages. Between 10 and 50% of the DOM-carbon, and 35 and 65% of the UV absorbance were removed from the extracts by flocculation. Higher removal was obtained with the more mature compost extract, yielding good correlations between compost maturity and the percentage of DOM-carbon removal and UV absorbance reduction. The total amount of flocculated DOM (on a dry matter basis), was similar in all compost samples (about 500 mg DOM-carbon/100 g dry compost). On the other hand, the total amount of non-flocculated DOM decreased dramatically with compost maturity, from similar to4500 to similar to500 mg DOM-carbon/100 g dry compost. It is believed that the relatively hydrophobic high MW fraction (humic-type material) is precipitated by the flocculation process, whereas the relatively hydrophilic low MW fraction tends to remain in solution. Flocculated DOM may represent the more resistant, less biodegradable fraction, and the more reactive toward hydrophobic organic contaminants.

J	Kaiser, K; Guggenberger, G; Haumaier, L; Zech, W				Kaiser, K; Guggenberger, G; Haumaier, L; Zech, W			The composition of dissolved organic matter in forest soil solutions: changes induced by seasons and passage through the mineral soil	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY					10th International Meeting of the International-Humic-Substances-Society	JUL, 2000	TOULOUSE, FRANCE	Int Humic Substances Soc, French Chapter				Dissolved organic matter in forest soils is a mixture of specific low-molecular-weight compounds and high-molecular-weight polyelectrolytes. The distribution of molecules of different molecular charge, weight, and size controls the reactivity of dissolved organic matter in the soil and, once exported from the soil, in the aqueous environment. The objective of this study was to track changes in the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter in soil as induced by seasons and the passage through the soil. In a 27-month field experiment, we collected seepage water from the organic forest floor layers and porewater in the mineral subsoil under a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and a European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stand. In the solutions, we measured the concentrations of organic carbon (C) and the composition of organic matter in combined 3-month samples using liquid-state H-1-NMR spectroscopy. Parallel to seasonal variations in the concentration of dissolved organic C, the H-1-NMR spectra of dissolved organic matter in forest floor leachates showed remarkable changes. At the pine site, dissolved organic matter released during winter and spring contained larger proportions of H associated with O-containing structures and Of low-molecular-weight compounds. During summer and autumn, the contribution of O-containing structures and low-molecular-weight compounds declined and broad signals in the aromatic and aliphatic region indicated the release of high-molecular-weight aromatic and aliphatic macromolecules. Forest floor leachates under beech showed a similar trend but a larger number of low-molecular-weight compounds was present in winter and spring samples. In spring, summer, and autumn samples acetate and sometimes succinate were most prominent. During the passage of dissolved organic matter through the upper mineral soil at the pine site, the number and intensity of signals due to low-molecular-weight compounds increased. These substances were thus more mobile than the macromolecules and/or released due to microbial transformation of organic matter. At the beech site subsoil porewater contained less low-molecular-weight compounds than the forest floor solutions but the present ones had increased signal intensities. We suggest that the differences of dissolved organic matter transformations during the passage through the upper mineral soil at the two sites were due to different microbial activity in the soils.

As wastewater treatment plant effluent passes through treatment wetlands, the DOM undergoes transformation to become more aromatic and oxygenated. Autochthonous sources are contributed to the DOM, the nature of which is governed by the developmental stage of the wetland system as well as vegetation patterns. Concentrations of specific waste water derived organic contaminants such as linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, caffeine, and ethylenediaminotetraacetic acid were significantly attenuated by wetland treatment and were not contributed by internal loading.																	0013-936X					DEC 15	2001	35	24					4805	4816		10.1021/es010518i						WOS:000172760600016	11775156	
J	Benoit, JM; Mason, RP; Gilmour, CC; Aiken, GR				Benoit, JM; Mason, RP; Gilmour, CC; Aiken, GR			Constants for mercury binding by dissolved organic matter isolates from the Florida Everglades	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been implicated as an important complexing agent for Hg that can affect its mobility and bioavailability in aquatic ecosystems. However, binding constants for natural Hg-DOM complexes are not well known. We employed a competitive ligand approach to estimate conditional stability constants for Hg complexes with DOM isolates collected from Florida Everglades surface waters. The isolates examined were the hydrophobic fraction of DOM from a eutrophic, sulfidic site (F1-HPoA) and the hydrophilic fraction front an oligotrophic, low-sulfide site (2BS-HPiA). Our experimental determinations utilized overall octanol-water partitioning coefficients (D-ow) for (203)Ha at 0.01 M chloride and across pH and DOM concentration gradients, Use of this radioisotope allowed rapid determinations of Hg concentrations in both water and octanol phases without problems of matrix interference. Conditional stability constants (I = 0.06, 23 degreesC) were log K' = 11.8 for F1-HPoA and log K' = 10.6 for 2BS-HPiA. These are similar to previously published stability constants for Hg binding to low-molecular-weight thiols. Further, F1-HPoA showed a pH-dependent decline in D-ow that was consistent with models of Hg complexation with thiol groups as the dominant Hg binding sites in DOM. These experiments demonstrate that the DOM isolates are stronger ligands for Hg than chloride ion or ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid. Speciation calculations indicate that at the DOM concentrations frequently measured in Everglades, 20 to 40 muM, significant complexation of Hg by DOM would be expected in aerobic (sulfide-free) surface waters, Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Absorption at 375 nm (a(375)) in the Greenland Sea varied from 0.77 m(-1) to the detection limit of our instrument (0.05 m(-1)), with the highest values found during summer. The spectral slope coefficient (S) ranged from 8.2 to 26.4 mum(-1) with the highest values occurring during winter. Seasonal variations in the in situ production and degradation of CDOM where shown to be responsible for the trends seen. A negative correlation between S and a(375) was evident in the Greenland Sea and differed noticeably from that found in coastal waters. The differing S-a(375) behavior of CDOM known to be of terrestrial origin allowed the development of an algorithm for the differentiation between marine and terrestrial organic matter. The behavior of marine CDOM was modeled by S 7.4 + 1.1/a(375).

The DOM-fraction distribution pattern and the ultraviolet absorbance to dissolved organic carbon ratio (UV/DOC ratio) were found remarkably effective for evaluating the characteristics of DOM in water. DOM-fraction distribution patterns were significantly different depending on the origin of the sample. AHS and HiA were found to be the dominant fractions in DOM in all samples studied. HiA prevailed over AHS in the lake water, whereas AHS were slightly more abundant than HiA in the river waters. AHS were in the great majority in forest streams and plowed-field percolates. HiA abounded in paddy-field outflow, domestic sewage, and sewage-treatment-plant effluent. Only domestic sewage contained a significant amount of HoN. The UV/DOC ratio also varied depending on the origin of the sampled the ratios in total DOM, AHS, and HiA were greater in river waters than in the lake water. The greatest ratio of AHS was found in paddy-field outflow and the lowest in domestic sewage. The UV/DOC ratios in the sewage-treatment-plant effluent were very similar to those in the lake water.

In this study, DOM from four high mountain lakes (two surrounded by meadows and two located on rocky terrain) was optically characterized and its photoreactivity was experimentally evaluated. To evaluate DOM photoreactivity. photobleaching rates of absorptivity, and fluorescence and their effects on DOM spectral properties were analyzed. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration ranged from 37 to 69 muM, absorptivity at 320 nm (a(320)) from 0.60 to 3.09 m(-1), and fluorescence from 1.30 to 5.70 QSU. Photobleaching of absorptivity was significant only at 320 nm (a(320)) resulting in half lives that varied from 2.6 to 6.7 d. Photobleaching of a(320) was significantly higher for DOM from takes located on rocky terrain than for DOM from lakes surrounded by meadows. Photobleaching of fluorescence emission at 450 nm (F-450) was significant only for three lakes and their ha-lf lives varied from 4.1 to 6.3 d. No significant difference,; were observed among the lakes studied. The changes over sunlight exposure of spectral slopes (S-UV), ratios of absorptivity at 250 nm to 365 nm (a(250):a(365)) and ratios of' fluorescence emission at 450 nm to 500 nm (F-450:F-500) did not show consistent trends with alternate increases and decreases. Lakes surrounded by meadows showed higher DOC concentrations, higher absorptivities, and lower ci,) photobleaching coefficients, suggesting that these lakes could be less vulnerable to UVR than lakes located on rocky terrain.

These experiments were conducted at two periods in the succession of plankton populations (May and June 1998), that differed in the quality of the prey ingested (Eudorina sp. compared to Cryptomonas sp. and Rhodomonas sp.) and their grazing intensity (31.8 +/- 2.2 mug C l(-1) day(-1) compared to 10.2 +/- 0.5 mug C l(-1) day(-1)). A systematic increase in bacterial biomass was measured in the treatments containing the highest zooplankton concentrations. The DOM concentrations produced in situ showed few significant differences between the three treatments, but the assimilation of DOM was higher in the presence of zooplankton than in their absence. These results show that the influence of cladocerans on the DOM was more of a qualitative than a quantitative nature. The protein compounds derived from the grazing activities of metazoans seem to be a major nutrient source for growth for bacteria (r = 0.81, P < 0.05). In this study, the highest hydrolytic activities were recorded in the presence of high concentrations of metazoan zooplankton. However, the processes that regulated these activities differed between the two experimental dates (repression compared to enzyme stimulation). Grazing activities could lead to an increase in phytoplanktonic excretion during the growth phase, and therefore the production of low molecular weight compounds that are easily assimilated by the bacterial plankton.																	0142-7873					NOV	2001	23	11					1249	1261		10.1093/plankt/23.11.1249						WOS:000171946200007

The properties and transformation of DOM extracted from municipal biowaste compost with 10 mM KCl at six stages during 370 days of composting were investigated. DOM was fractionated into molecular weight fractions by ultrafiltration, and DOM structure was studied using CPMAS C-13-NMR- and UV-spectroscopy. The distribution of C-14-labelled model substances (DEHP, pyrene, simazine) upon molecular weight fractions was investigated by ultrafiltration, and association to DOM was studied performing flocculation experiments. The binding capacity of DOM for the model substances was of secondary influence for the mobilization because the intense biochemical reactions during composting pre-dominated the fate of the substances. Composting favoured the degradation of model substances to polar metabolites and supported their binding to the DOM matrix. DEHP and simazine were mainly found in the low- to medium-molecular DOM fraction and showed a small amount of DOM-associated radioactivity (approx. 10%). Pyrene and its metabolites had high affinities to high-molecular DOM. However, a direct relationship between DOM-quality and enhancement of pyrene solubility was not visible. After 120 days of composting DOM showed the highest binding capacity for hydrophobic contaminants. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Wang, GS; Pai, SY				Wang, GS; Pai, SY			Ozonation of dissolved organic matter in biologically treated wastewater effluents	OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Ozonation was evaluated for control of dissolved organic pollutants in biologically treated wastewater effluents. The non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon (NPDOC) concentration was 7 mg/L in the wastewater effluent, and the aqueous ozone dosage applied in the reactor was between 0.5 - 5 mg/L. Due to the presence of the unsettled activated sludge (similar to8 mg/L of suspended solids), the concentration of the dissolved organic compounds could be increased by more than 120% due to the decomposition of the microorganisms during the ozonation processes. An 80% reduction in NPDOC concentration was obtained in two hours contact time if the water was filtered before ozonation. A rapid removal Of UV254 was observed whether or not the water was filtered before the ozonation. Better oxidation efficiency was obtained when the water samples were adjusted to an acidic condition, and it was observed that the presence of the carbonate/bicarbonate ions inhibited the degradation of the organic compounds. However, the effects from various pH and alkalinity conditions were not pronounced. In addition, ammonia nitrogen was oxidized to nitrate nitrogen during the ozonation processes, causing a large increase in UV absorbance at wavelength lower than 240 nm.

In this study, the applicability of equilibrium dialysis (molecular weight cut-off = 1000 Da) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) to determine 'free' Al, Fe(III) and Zn in four forest soil solutions was compared. The 'free' metals as measured by both methods, consist of hydrated metal cations and soluble inorganic metal complexes. In addition, dialysis measures any organic complexes < 1000 Da and DGT measures a portion of smaller labile organic complexes. The four soil solutions were prepared by water extraction of an organic soil horizon (H) from a Fimic Anthrosol, and contained either 20 or 75 mg C/I dissolved organic matter at pH 4.0 and pH 7.0. To test the performance of both methods and optimize experimental volume and time, experiments using metal nitrate solutions were carried out. In the solutions at pH 4.0, no significant differences in average 'free' metal contents were found for Al, Fe(III) or Zn. This makes DGT a viable alternative for equilibrium dialysis for the study of the complexation of all three metals in acidic soils. At pH 7.0, again no significant difference between both methods were found for Al and Fe(III), but the DGT results for Zn were significantly higher. This was likely caused by labile organic complexes that were only detected by DGT. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The way and extent to which these processes are affected depends on the amount and the chemical composition of soluble organic matter. Because the amount of soluble organic matter varies seasonally with changes in the microbial activity in soil, it seems reasonable to assume that there may be also seasonal changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. We examined dissolved organic matter in the seepage waters of organic forest floor layers over a 27-month period (1997-1999) in two forest ecosystems, a 160-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand and a 90-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. The forest floor leachates were analysed for bulk dissolved organic C, C in hydrophilic and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter fractions, lignin-derived phenols (CuO oxidation), hydrolysable neutral carbohydrates and uronic acids, hydrolysable amino sugars, and stable carbon isotope composition. In addition, we studied the samples by use of liquid-state C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For both investigated forest sites we found that the dissolved organic carbon concentrations in forest floor leachates were largest during summer. They peaked after rain storms following short dry periods (106-145 mg dissolved organic C l(-1)). The proportions of C in the hydrophilic fractions were largest in winter and spring whereas in summer and autumn more C was found in the hydrophobic fraction. According to liquid-state C-13-NMR spectroscopy, summer and autumn samples had larger abundances of aromatic and aliphatic structures as well as larger proportions of carboxyl groups whereas the winter and spring samples were dominated by resonances indicating carbohydrates. Wet-chemical analyses confirmed these results. Winter and spring samples were rich in neutral carbohydrates and amino sugars. The summer and autumn samples contained more lignin-derived phenols which were also stronger oxidised than those in the winter and spring samples. Seasonal changes of delta C-13 values were found to reflect the changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. Most negative values occurred when isotopically light lignin-derived compounds were abundant and less negative values when carbohydrates predominated. The different vegetation, age of the stands, and underlying mineral soils resulted in different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and in differences in the distribution between hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic carbon. Despite of this, the results suggest that the trends in temporal variations in the composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water were remarkably similar for both sites. Dissolved organic matter in winter and spring seems to be mainly controlled by leaching of fresh disrupted biomass debris with a large contribution of bacterial and fungal-derived carbohydrates and amino sugars. Dissolved organic matter leached from the forest floor in summer and autumn is controlled by the decomposition processes in the forest floor resulting in the production of strongly oxidised, water-soluble aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water in winter and spring indicates larger mobility, larger biodegradability, and less interaction with metals and organic pollutants than that released during summer and autumn. Thus, the impact of dissolved organic matter on transport processes may vary throughout the year due to changes in its composition.

We took soil material from the B horizons of a Podzol at Skanes Varsjo (southern Sweden). In batch experiments, soil was equilibrated with solutions varying in pH and concentration of dissolved organic C. In Bh samples, the release of dissolved C gradually increased with increase in pH. In the Bs1 material there was a minimum at pH 4.1, and in the Bs2 soil the minimum occurred at pH 4.6. The ability to retain added dissolved C increased in the order Bh<Bs1 <Bs2. The column experiment was run for 160 days under unsaturated flow conditions. Columns were packed with Bh, Bh+Bs1 or Bh+Bs1 +Bs2 samples to calculate mass balances for each horizon. Solutions either without any dissolved organic C or ones containing 49 mg C dm(-3) with pH of 4.0 or 3.6 were used to leach columns. The pH of input solutions only little affected the concentration of dissolved C in the effluent. Relative proportions of hydrophobic substances decreased with increasing column length and decreasing pH. For input solutions containing dissolved C, near steady state was achieved for both the Bs1 and Bs2 horizons with approximately 25% dissolved organic matter retention. Thus, no maximum sorption capacity for dissolved C could be defined for these horizons. This behaviour could not have been predicted by batch data, showing that column experiments provide useful additional information on interactions between organic compounds and solid soil material.																	1351-0754					SEP	2001	52	3					409	421		10.1046/j.1365-2389.2001.00399.x						WOS:000170903600007

From February to October 1998, surface water samples were collected along 9 transects in the Tyne estuary, Northeast England, from the tidal limit into the coastal North Sea. In 8 of these transects, mixing plots of absorbance vs. salinity indicated substantial removal of CDOM absorbance (average: 32%) in the upper estuary. Results from laboratory studies under simulated estuarine conditions suggest that an average of 21% (range: 9-39%) of riverine CDOM may be removed by adsorption onto suspended sediment, while CDOM flocculation accounted for an average removal of only 6% (range: 0-18%). We propose that adsorptive removal exerts a major control on CDOM in estuaries with elevated turbidity levels.																	0094-8276					SEP 1	2001	28	17					3309	3312		10.1029/2000GL012509						WOS:000170698700025

Measurements of both protein and "fulvic-like" fluorescence is undertaken from January to December 1999. The wavelengths of fulvic-like fluorescence excitation and emission and of protein fluorescence emission were all determined to be sensitive fingerprints of organic matter fluxes through the ground water, with iter within the till and within both gypsum and limestone strata deep inside the Magnesian Limestone being differentiated by these parameters. Previous research has suggested that proteins in waters are "young" in age, hence our seasonal variations suggest that we are sampling recently formed DOM. The rapid response of all deep borehole samples suggests relatively rapid ground iter flow, probably through karstic cave systems developed in the gypsum and solution widened features in the dolomitic lime)ne. Our results suggest that use of both protein and fulvic-like fluorescence wavelength variations provides a DOM signature at can be used as a natural tracer.

J	Lu, JH; Wu, L				Lu, JH; Wu, L			Spectrophotometric determination of polyacrylamide in waters containing dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Using polyacrylamide (PAM) to reduce soil erosion in irrigated land has increased rapidly in recent years. A simple and reliable method to measure the PAM concentration in waters containing dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of great importance in assessing the fate and efficiency of PAM application. In this research, an analytical method to determine the PAM concentration of waters with correction for DOM interference was developed and tested. The method is based on a combination of determining the total concentration of amide groups by the N-bromination method (NBM) and determining the DOM content spectrophotometrically. The total concentration of amide groups of both PAM and DOM was determined by NBM at 570 nm. The DOM moiety, which is proportional to DOM concentration, was determined by spectrophotometry using a UV 254-nm wavelength. The actual PAM concentration of a water sample (soil extract containing PAM in this study) was obtained from NBM readings subtracted by the interferential DOM contribution using a correction curve. Analysis of PAM in two soil-water samples showed that the recoveries ranged from 94 to 100.3% for the 2 mg/L PAM sample and from 98.4 to 101.4% for the 10 mg/L PAM sample with various DOM concentrations.

Samples of 0.2 mum filtered lake water were exposed in quartz tubes to different portions of the solar spectrum using optical cutoff filters to remove parts of the ultraviolet (UV) region of the solar spectrum. Changes in the spectral absorption in these samples and the absorbed incident energy were used to calculate spectral weighting functions (SWFs) for the photobleaching (PB) of CDOM. PB was measured as the loss of a(CDOM)(lambda) (the a(CDOM)[lambda] was averaged from 280 to 500 nm) per unit absorbed energy. CDOM from humic and clear lakes, as well as from a Sphagnum bog and an algal culture, was used in the experiments covering a wide range of carbon sources, We used an iterative, nonlinear optimization method to fit the measured results to a simple exponential function in order to generate each SWF. Comparing individual SWFs calculated for various CDOM sources, we computed a summary SWF from the experiments using epilimnial CDOM from our study lakes. Our summary SWF was able to explain 80-90% of the observed variance in our exposure experiments, and we were able to predict PB results obtained for other Argentine lakes (mean error 14.5%). Finally, we calculated that the effect of UV-B radiation on PB was small (< 20% of total decrease in the absorption coefficient) compared to U-VA and blue light radiation. This suggested that increased UV-B radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion would not greatly increase the photobleaching of whole water column CDOM in Patagonian lakes (< 10%).

Low-salinity waters from the Gulf of Paria in the Orinoco River estuary with high content of fluorescent DOM were observed to decrease their fluorescence yield while releasing ammonium upon experimental exposure to natural sunlight. Our field data collected during two cruises across the eastern Caribbean Sea evidence the disappearance of DOM fluorescence beyond that expected from dilution, thus indicating that during the seasonal extension of the Orinoco River plume throughout the eastern Caribbean Sea, ammonium release from DOM constitutes a major source of inorganic nitrogen to phytoplankton communities in the river plume. We propose that this mechanism, along with nitrogen retention through recycling, explains enhanced surface phytoplankton biomass of up to 1000 km from the river delta.																	0148-0227					AUG 15	2001	106	C8					16807	16813		10.1029/1999JC000268						WOS:000170326000014

One possible determinant for the losses of dissolved organic nutrients leaving the soil environment could be their distribution between dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions of different mobility in soil. To elucidate the potential influence of DOM fractions under varying flow conditions on the vertical translocation of organically bound nutrients, we determined the concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic C (DOC) and nutrients (DON, DOP, DOS) in soil water under a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and a European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. We sampled seepage water from the organic forest floor layer and the mineral subsoil using zero-tension lysimeters and soil pore water using tension lysimeters and suction cups. DOM in soil water was fractionated into hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds by XAD-8 at pH 2. We found that the organic forest floor layers were large sources for DOC, DON, DOP, and DOS. The dissolved organic nutrients were mainly concentrated in the hydrophilic DOM fraction which proved to be more mobile in mineral soil pore water than the hydrophobic one. Consequently, the concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic nutrients decreased less with depth than those of DOC. Concentrations as well as fluxes in subsoil pore water of DOC and dissolved organic nutrients in the studied weakly developed soils were high as compared with literature data on deeply developed forest soils. Under conditions of rapid water flow through the strongly structured mineral soil at the beech site, almost no retention of DOM took place and thus the influence of the distribution of organically bound nutrients between the DOM fractions on the export of DON, DOP, and DOS was negligible.

J	Osburn, CL; Morris, DP; Thorn, KA; Moeller, RE				Osburn, CL; Morris, DP; Thorn, KA; Moeller, RE			Chemical and optical changes in freshwater dissolved organic matter exposed to solar radiation	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We studied the chemical and optical changes in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two freshwater lakes and a Sphagnum bog after exposure to solar radiation. Stable carbon isotopes and solid-state C-13-NMR spectra of DOM were used together with optical and chemical data to interpret results from experimental exposures of DOM to sunlight and from seasonal observations of two lakes in northeastern Pennsylvania. Solar photochemical oxidation of humic-rich bog DOM to smaller LMW compounds and to DIC was inferred from losses of UV absorbance, optical indices of molecular weight and changes in DOM chemistry. Experimentally, we observed a 1.2 parts per thousand enrichment in delta C-13 and a 47% loss in aromatic C functionality in bog DOM samples exposed to solar UVR. Similar results were observed in the surface waters of both lakes. In late summer hypolimnetic water in humic Lake Lacawac, we observed 3 to 4.5 parts per thousand enrichments in delta C-13 and a 30% increase in aromatic C relative to early spring values during spring mixing. These changes coincided with increases in molecular weight and UV absorbance. Anaerobic conditions of the hypolimnion in Lake Lacawac suggest that microbial metabolism may be turning over allochthonous C introduced during spring mixing, as well as autochthonous C. This metabolic activity produces HMW DOM during the summer, which is photochemically labile and isotopically distinct from allochthonous DOM or autochthonous DOM. These results suggest both photooxidation of allochthonous DOM in the epilimnion and autotrophic production of DOM by bacteria in the hypolimnion cause seasonal trends in the UV absorbance of lakes.																	0168-2563					JUL	2001	54	3					251	278		10.1023/A:1010657428418						WOS:000169863000002

The percentages of hydrophobic DOC (Hob-DOC) fractionated by XAD-8 resin were 33% for the bay waters and 41% for the river waters, whereas those of labile DOC (which decomposed during an incubation period of 100 days) were 20% and 24%, respectively. The increment of DOC to Chlorophyll a was calculated to be (0.014 mgl(-1))/(mu gl(-1)). The mixing experiments suggested a negligible deposition of DOC at the estuaries of inflowing rivers. The Hob-DOC went through the bay with negligible changes in concentration in both summer and winter, but its chemical characteristics, e.g. spectrophotometric properties and mean molecular weight, differed from those of riverine origin. In contrast, both labile and refractory components of Hil-DOC were produced mainly in the inner part of the bay during summer, and although a significant percentage of the labile component was subjected to biodegradation during transport to the outer part of the bay, its chemical characteristics did not change dramatically.

J	Huang, XJ; Lee, LS				Huang, XJ; Lee, LS			Effects of dissolved organic matter from animal waste effluent on chlorpyrifos sorption by soils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The increased use of animal waste-derived effluents for irrigation could result in the enhanced movement of pesticides through complexation with dissolved organic materials. Batch equilibrium studies were conducted to measure the interaction among soil, chlorpyrifos [O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphorothioate], and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from poultry, swine, and cow waste-derived lagoon effluents. All DOM was found to have a strong affinity for chlorpyrifos, resulting in reduced sorption of chlorpyrifos by soil, thus the potential for DOM-enhanced mobility. Effluent DOM was observed to sorb to soils. Thus, for increasingly higher soil mass to solution volume ratios, the effect of chlorpyrifus association with water-borne DOM on sorption decreases significantly. For high soil mass to solution volume ratios typical of soil profiles in the landscape, the potential for DOM-enhanced transport will be greatly attenuated. Dissolved organic matter concentration and the nonpolar nature of DOM in the lagoon effluent decreased with increasing residence time in the cells of the lagoon system, thus reducing the potential for DOM-enhanced transport.																	0047-2425					JUL-AUG	2001	30	4					1258	1265								WOS:000174863000017	11476503

This study was conducted to determine the effect of DOM transformation after ozonation on THM formation and to elucidate the difference in THMFP and DOC removal. Changes in DOC, THMFP, reactivities of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic DOC, and phenolic-OH were determined to explain the difference in THMFP and DOC removal after ozonation. Higher reduction in THMFP (24-46%) relative to DOC (10-16%) was obtained and was attributed to the following: transformation of DOM From a more reactive hydrophobic DOC (mug THM produced per mg organic carbon) to a less reactive hydrophilic DOC and to the decrease in the reactivities of both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOC after ozonation. The results also showed decrease in phenolic-OH indicating the oxidation of some reactive sites like resorcinol or meta-dihydroxy benzene ring structures, which are prone to chlorine substitution, consequently decreasing. the reactivity of the organic carbon to form THM. These changes in DOM led to a significant decrease in THMFP with no remarkable removal in DOC. (C) 2001 Elsevisr Science Ltd.

J	Kitis, M; Kilduff, JE; Karanfil, T				Kitis, M; Kilduff, JE; Karanfil, T			Isolation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from surface waters using reverse osmosis and its impact on the reactivity of DOM to formation and speciation of disinfection by-products	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (BOM) from three low-hardness surface waters was isolated and concentrated using a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane system. The efficacy of the RO isolation method and its impact on the subsequent reactivity between DOM and chlorine were examined. DOM mass balances (quantified as dissolved organic carbon) ranged from 96.1 to 102.1 % for the three waters tested, and DOM mass recoveries of 93.9 to 98.2% indicated successful isolation, minimal fractionation, and negligible loss of organic matter. RO isolates were diluted using distilled and deionized water in the laboratory to reconstitute the source waters. Both source water (collected at the time of isolation) and reconstituted source water samples were chlorinated. Formation of several disinfection by-products (DBPs: e.g., THMs. HAA(9), HANs, and HKs) were measured. For all waters tested, DBP formation of source and corresponding reconstituted source water agreed within 95% confidence intervals. Therefore, RO isolation had no impact on the DOM reactivity of the three low-hardness surface water tested in this study. In addition, the degree of bromine substitution. as expressed by the bromine incorporation factor, was calculated. Comparison of bromine incorporation factors for sourer and reconstituted source waters further indicated that, as with the total DBP formations, bromine speciation and the relative occurrence of individual species in THMs and HAA(9) did not change as a result of the isolation. Overall, in terms of DBP formation, RO isolation appears to maintain the integrity and reactivity of DOM. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In a laboratory study. natural assemblages of marine bacteria rapidly (in < 48 hours) utilized labile compounds (glucose, glutamate) and produced refractory DOM that persisted for more than a year. Only 10 to 15% of the bacterially derived DOM was identified as hydrolyzable amino acids and sugars, a feature consistent with marine DOM. These results suggest that microbial processes alter the molecular structure of DOM, making it resistant to further degradation and thereby preserving fixed carbon in the ocean.

J	Zhou, LX; Wong, JWC				Zhou, LX; Wong, JWC			Effect of dissolved organic matter from sludge and sludge compost on soil copper sorption	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Interaction of Cu with dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important physicochemical process affecting Cu mobility in soils. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DOM from anaerobically digested dewatered sludge and sludge compost on the sorption of Cu on an acidic sandy loam and a calcareous clay loam. in the presence of DOM, Cu sorption capacity decreased markedly for both soils, especially for the calcareous soil. The Cu sorption isotherms could be well described by the Freundlich equation (r(2) = 0.99), and the binding intensity parameter of soils in the presence of sludge DOM was lower than compost DOM. An increase in DOM concentration significantly reduced the sorption of Cu by both soils. Within the Cu and DOM concentration range studied, the decrease in Cu sorption caused by sludge DOM was consistently greater than that of compost DOM. This might be attributed to the greater amount of hydrophobic fraction of DOM in the compost. Moreover, the reduction of Cu sorption caused by DOM was more obvious in the soil with higher pH. In addition, the sorption of Cu increased with an increase in pH for both soils without the addition of DOM, while Cu sorption in the presence of DOM was unexpectedly decreased with an increase in pH at a pH >6.8. This implied that DOM produced by sludge or other C-enriched organic, wastes heavily applied on calcareous soils might facilitate the leaching loss of Cu because of the formation of soluble DOM-metal complexes.

The 10% levels of surface solar radiation for the ultraviolet (UV) B range (at 305- and 320-nm wavelengths were at 16 and 23 m in depth and for the UVA range (at 340- and 380-nm wavelengths) were at 35 and 63 m in depth, respectively. The DOM fluorescence decreased over the course of the day, whereas H2O2 concentrations increased, especially in the diurnally stratified surface water layers extending to 10-50-m depth. In situ H2O2 net production varied between 5.5 nmol L-1 h(-1) at 5-m depth and 1 nmol L-1 h(-1) at 40-m depth, resulting in an H2O2 net production of similar to 38 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in the upper 50 m of the water column. Photochemical oxygen (O-2) demand of water collected at 10-m depth in the early morning and exposed to surface solar radiation varied between 0.9 and 2.8 mu mol O-2 L-1 d(-1) and was found to be consistently higher (by a 1.3-8.3-fold measure) than bacterial respiration (measured in 0.8 mum-filtered seawater in the dark). WE radiation was responsible for 0-30% of the photochemical O-2 demand. A simple one-dimensional physical model was combined with a photochemical/ biological model in order to describe the photochemical production of H2O2 at different depth layers over the course of the day and to determine the contribution of physical versus biological processes in terms of the loss of H2O2 from the surface lavers in the late afternoon. The model reflects well the observed diurnal H2O2 dynamics. It further provides evidence that mainly biological breakdown determines the loss of H2O2 in the upper 50 m of the water column during the day; however, in the late afternoon, vertical mixing is important in transporting H2O2 from the uppermost 5-m layer to the 10-20-m layers.

J	Lu, XQ; Jaffe, R				Lu, XQ; Jaffe, R			Interaction between Hg(II) and natural dissolved organic matter: A fluorescence spectroscopy based study	WATER RESEARCH												Interaction between Hg(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected from surface water samples of the Florida Everglades was studied using different fluorescence spectroscopic methods. Complexation between Hg(II) and DOM leached from mangrove leaves, sawgrass, and periphyton was investigated. Both fluorescence emission and synchronous fluorescence spectra showed that these dissolved organic materials, whether they are highly degraded or are freshly leached, can "complex" Hg(II) since fluorescence intensity was quenched upon addition of Hg(II) to the DOM samples. Synchronous fluorescence spectra disclosed structural information on the DOM sample, regarding possible binding sites for Hg(II). Chemical parameters on the complexation of Hg(II), including the conditional stability constants and the percentage of fluorophores participating in the complexation, were estimated by the modified Stern-Volmer equation. A detailed investigation under different experimental conditions showed that the complexation of the DOM samples collected from the Everglades was influenced by pH, Cl-(aq)(-) anion, and cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. Experimental results suggest that DOM-Hg(II) complexes run be removed from the water column through adsorption on biogenically precipitated CaCO3(s). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Wiegner, TN; Seitzinger, SP				Wiegner, TN; Seitzinger, SP			Photochemical and microbial degradation of external dissolved organic matter inputs to rivers	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Photochemical and microbial degradation of external inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from both natural (forests) and anthropogenic (swine and equine pastures) non-point sources to rivers were examined through field and laboratory microcosm experiments. Little or no photochemical degradation of DOM to inorganic N or P occurred in either the agricultural or forest runoff. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, and PO43-, concentrations did not change during the photochemical experiments for any of the sources examined. A small, but significant increase in the NO3-/NO2- (+0.7 muM; p = 0.004) concentration was detected in the forest runoff, suggesting that a small fraction (4 to 9 %) of the DON may be photochemically degraded to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Bacteria readily utilized DOC and DON in the agriculture and forest runoff. The percent of DOC and DON consumed by the bacteria ranged from 6 to 14 % and 21 to 25 %, respectively. Light exposure did not alter the biological availability of the DOC and DON in either the equine pasture or forest runoff. Our results emphasize the importance of microbial processes in degrading DOM I in riverine environments; they appear to degrade DOM more rapidly than photochemical processes and may be more important in affecting the quantity and quality of the DOM exported from rivers to estuaries.																	0948-3055					MAR 28	2001	24	1					27	40		10.3354/ame024027						WOS:000168208300004

In addition, substrate availability is believed to be reduced under anoxic conditions since oxygenases cannot be used. Consequently, it is generally assumed that bacteria grow slower in anoxic environments than in oxic environments. The results of the present study challenge this view. We compared the growth of bacterial assemblages under carbon-limited conditions in lake water under anoxic and oxic conditions. Bioassay experiments were performed with water from 3 lakes differing in nutrient concentrations and organic matter content. Among bacteria using the same source of organic matter, median anoxic growth rates were 84 to 110% of oxic growth rates. The total biomass yield during the experiments did not differ between anoxic and oxic treatments. We suggest that anoxic bacterial growth was regulated by substrate availability rather than by metabolic energy yield and that availability of organic matter under anoxic conditions was equal to or even greater than that in oxic treatments. This implies that anoxic decomposition rates may actually have been faster than oxic rates.

Uptake rate constants (mL g(-1) h(-1)) of metals, in general, increased with increasing DOC concentrations, with an initial decrease at lower DOC concentrations. Oyster dry weight concentration factors (DCF, mt g(-1)), determined at the end of exposure experiments (8 h), also increased for Cd, Co, Cr, Ag, and Zn, but decreased for Hg, with increasing DOC concentrations. Changes of metal uptake rate constants and DCF values with DOC concentration suggest that metal uptake pathways by American oysters vary from predominantly uptake (by diffusion of neutral) of free ionic, inorganically complexed, and LMW organic ligand complexed metals at very low DOC concentration to direct ingestion and digestion of HMW or colloidally complexed metals at higher DOC concentrations. Measured partition coefficients (K-c) between dissolved and colloidal phases were comparable between metals, ranging from 10(5.12) to 10(5.75) mL g(-1). However, DCF values and uptake rate constants differed considerably between metals, with the highest DCF Values and uptake rate constants found for B-type metals, e.g., Ag, Hg, Zn, and Cd, and the lowest ones for several intermediate-type metals (e.g., Co, Cr). Metal types and thus the interaction of metals with organic ligands, such as strong complexation of B-type metals with S-containing organic ligands, may play an important role in the bioavailability and toxicity of metals to aquatic organisms. Differences in metal uptake in contrasting LMW and HMW DOC treatments suggest a generally depressed bioavailability of colloidally complexed metals at low DOC concentration (0.5 ppm) but a generally enhanced uptake at higher DOC concentrations.

J	Kelly, DJ; Clare, JJ; Bothwell, ML				Kelly, DJ; Clare, JJ; Bothwell, ML			Attenuation of solar ultraviolet radiation by dissolved organic matter alters benthic colonization patterns in streams	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the principle constituent in fresh water responsible for attenuation of ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm). Previous field experiments using UVR exclusion filters have shown that UVR can inhibit accrual of lotic attached algal communities, change algal species composition, decrease benthic invertebrate abundances, and alter the trophic dynamics of stream communities. We examined the colonization of lotic assemblages in outdoor flumes exposed to a range of UVR intensities by suspending 7-cm deep water filters differing in DOM concentration above each flume to filter natural sunlight. DOM solutions of 0, 2, 5, and 8 mg/L resulted in light exposures ranging from 12-74% ambient UVB, 34-89% ambient UVA, and 80-94% ambient photosynthetically active radiation. This approach isolated the UVR-attenuating properties of DOM from potential biochemical effects. There was a sharp transition in biological effects between 2 and 5 mg/ L DOM. No significant differences in algal biomass or invertebrate abundances were observed between 5 and 8 mg/L or between 0 and 2 mg/L DOM. Algal accrual was initially higher under 5 and 8 mg/L DOM treatments (i.e., lowest WR); however, this trend was reversed following 24 d of colonization after which algal biomass was significantly greater under 0 and 2 mg/L DOM (i.e, highest WR). Grazer abundance (predominantly chironomids) was significantly higher in the 5 and 8 mg/L treatments. The higher densities of grazers in these treatments likely reduced algal standing crops in the later part of the experiment. Blackfly (Simuliidae) and oligochaete (Naididae) abundances were also reduced in low-DOM: treatments, although trends were not as pronounced as for chironomids. We predict that streams with DOM concentrations <5 mg/L could be particularly sensitive to UVR. Potentially, these streams would be most negatively affected by future increases in UVR exposure as a result of ozone depletion or DOM decreases related to natural or human-induced factors.																	0887-3593					MAR	2001	20	1					96	108		10.2307/1468191						WOS:000167152700008		
J	Amon, RMW; Fitznar, HP; Benner, R				Amon, RMW; Fitznar, HP; Benner, R			Linkages among the bioreactivity, chemical composition, and diagenetic state of marine dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bacterial growth and the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were followed during a 10-d decomposition experiment with fresh, algal-derived DOM from an Arctic ice flee. During the experiment similar to 30% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was used by bacteria, indicating the highly reactive nature of this fresh DOM. Over half of the DOC consumption was accounted for as losses of combined neutral sugars and amino acids. The initial composition of the DOM was characterized by high neutral sugar (14% DOG) and amino acid (7.4% DOG) yields and the dominance of glucose (similar to 75 mol%) and glutamic acid (similar to 25 mol%). During microbial degradation the neutral sugar and amino acid yields decreased, and the molecular composition of the DOM became more uniform. The relatively constant abundance of D amino acids and the dramatic changes in the neutral sugar and amino acid compositions indicated that bacteria were important in shaping the chemical composition of marine DOM by selectively removing bioreactive components and by leaving behind biorefractory components. Based on principal component analysis and other parameters, neutral sugars and amino acids were found to be excellent indicators of the diagenetic state and bioavailability of marine DOM.																	0024-3590					MAR	2001	46	2					287	297								WOS:000167819900009		
J	Ma, HZ; Allen, HE; Yin, YJ				Ma, HZ; Allen, HE; Yin, YJ			Characterization of isolated fractions of dissolved organic matter from natural waters and a wastewater effluent	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was concentrated from natural waters and the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant using a portable reverse osmosis (RO) system. The humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA) and hydrophilic (HyI) fractions were isolated and purified by the XAD-8 resin combined with the cation exchange resin method. The FA fractions predominated in natural waters and accounted for 54-68% of the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), whereas the HA and HyI fractions constituted, respectively, 13-29 and 9-30% of the total DOG. The effluent of wastewater was almost devoid of HA and the HyI fraction exceeded FA. The elemental compositions of HA and FA were in the ranges typical for natural humic materials, but the HyI fractions did nor exhibit humic character. (1)H NMR spectra revealed that the HyI fractions were almost devoid of aromatic protons and the aliphatic region featured more sharp signals than HA and FA fractions, indicating that HyI fractions were consisted of more simple compounds and less complex mixtures. The aliphatic functional groups in these fractions of DOM samples followed the order HA < FA < HyI. Proton titrations indicated that HA, FA and HyI fractions of DOM samples from different sources had similar total acidity whose range was 9.0-11.6 meq/g C. This similarity may be due to the sample fractionation method. The copper titration results showed that the number of total Cu binding sites for the three fractions of different DOM samples were guile similar (1.46-1.60 mmol/gC), which was consistent with the similarity in total acidity from proton titrations. The affinity of copper with each isolated fraction followed the order HA approximate to FA > HyI. The rate of Cu complexation with the HyI fraction was faster than the rate with the HA or FA fraction of the Suwannee River DOM, implying that copper reacted with relatively weak ligands faster than with strong ligands.

J	Kahru, M; Mitchell, BG				Kahru, M; Mitchell, BG			Seasonal and nonseasonal variability of satellite-derived chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter concentration in the California Current	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Time series of surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) derived from the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor and Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor were evaluated for the California Current area using regional algorithms. Satellite data composited for 8-day periods provide the ability to describe large-scale changes in surface parameters. These changes are difficult to detect based on in situ observations alone that suffer from undersampling the large temporal and spatial variability, especially in Chi. We detected no significant bias in satellite Chi estimates compared with ship-based measurements. The variability in CDOM concentration was significantly smaller than that in Chi, both spatially and temporally. While being subject to large interannual and short-term variations, offshore waters (100-1000 km from the shore) have an annual cycle of Chi and CDOM with a maximum in winter-spring (December-March) and a minimum in late summer. For inshore waters the maximum is more likely in spring (April-May). We detect significant increase in both Chi and CDOM off central and southern California during the La Nina year of 1999. The trend of increasing Chi and CDOM from October 1996 to June 2000 is statistically significant in many areas.																	0148-0227					FEB 15	2001	106	C2					2517	2529		10.1029/1999JC000094						WOS:000166904900012

The significance of DOM for ice-based productivity and carbon turnover therefore remains highly speculative. DOM within sea ice from the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, Antarctica, in 1994 and the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, in 1992 and 1997 was investigated. Measurements were made on melted sea-ice sections in 1994 and 1997 and in sea-ice brines in 1992. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations in melted ice cores were up to 1.8 and 0.78 mM, respectively, or 30 and 8 times higher than those in surface water concentrations, respectively. However, when concentrations within the brine channel/pore space were calculated from estimated brine volumes, actual concentrations of DOC in brines were up to 23.3 mM and DON up to 2.2 mM, although mean values were 1.8 and 0.15 mM, respectively. There were higher concentrations of DOM in warm, porous summer second-year sea ice compared with colder autumn first-year ice, consistent with the different biological activity supported within the various ice types. However, in general there was poor correlation between DOC and DON with algal biomass and numbers of bacteria within the ice. The mean DOC/DON ratio was 11, although again values were highly variable, ranging from 3 to highly carbon-enriched samples of 95. Measurements made on a limited dataset showed that carbohydrates constitute on average 35% of the DOC pool, with highly variable contributions of 1-99%.

However, the behaviour of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during ice formation and growth has not been Studied to date. DOM is the primary energetic substrate for microbial heterotrophic activity in sea water and sea ice, and therefore it is at the base of the trophic fluxes within the microbial food web. The aim of our study was to compare the behaviour of DOM and inorganic nutrients during formation and growth of sea ice. Experiments were conducted in a large indoor ice-tank facility Hamburg Ship Model Basin, Germany) at -15degreesC. Three 1 m 3 tanks, to which synthetic sea water, nutrients and dissolved organic compounds (diatom-extracted DOM) had been added, were sampled over a period of 5 days during sea-ice Formation. Samples,were collected throughout the experiment from water underlying the ice, and at the end from the ice as well. Brine was obtained from the ice by centrifuging ice cores. Inorganic nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) were substantially enriched in brine in comparison to water and ice phases, consistent with the processes of ice formation and brine rejection. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was also enriched in brine but was more variable and enriched in comparison to a dilution line. No difference in bacteria numbers was observed between water, ice and brine. No bacteria growth was measured, and this therefore had no influence on the measurable DOC levels. We conclude that the incorporation of dissolved organic compounds in newly forming ice is conservative. However, since (lie proportions of DOC in the brine were partially higher than those of the inorganic nutrients, concentrating effects of DOC in brine might be different compared tu salts.

J	Buffam, I; Galloway, JN; Blum, LK; McGlathery, KJ				Buffam, I; Galloway, JN; Blum, LK; McGlathery, KJ			A stormflow/baseflow comparison of dissolved organic matter concentrations and bioavailability in an Appalachian stream	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Patterns of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) delivery were compared between times of stormflow and baseflow in Paine Run, an Appalachian stream draining a 12.4 km(2) forested catchment in the Shenandoah National Park (SNP), Virginia. The potential in-stream ecological impact of altered concentrations and/or chemical composition of DOM during storms also was examined, using standardized bacterial bioassays. DOC and DON concentrations in Paine Run were consistently low during baseflow and did not show a seasonal pattern. During storms however, mean DOC and DON concentrations approximately doubled, with maximum concentrations occurring on the rising limb of storm hydrographs. The rapid response of DOM concentration to changes in flow suggests a near-stream or in-stream source of DOM during storms. Stormflow (4% of the time, 36% of the annual discharge) contributed > 50% of DOC, DON and NO(3)(-) flux in Paine Run during 1997. In laboratory bacterial bioassays, growth rate constants were higher on Paine Run stormflow water than on baseflow water, but the fraction of total DOM which was bioavailable was not significantly different. The fraction of the total stream DOC pool taken up by water column bacteria was estimated to increase from 0.03 +/- 0.02% h(-1) during baseflow, to 0.15 +/- 0.04% h(-1) during storms. This uptake rate would have a minimal effect on bulk DOM concentrations in Paine Run, but storms may still have considerable impact on the bacterial stream communities by mobilizing them into the water column and by supplying a pulse of DOM.

J	Kahler, P; Koeve, W				Kahler, P; Koeve, W			Marine dissolved organic matter: can its C : N ratio explain carbon overconsumption?	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Carbon overconsumption, i.e. the consumption of inorganic carbon relative to inorganic nitrogen in excess of the Redfield ratio at the sea surface, was examined in relation to the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) in the northeast Atlantic. We observed the presence of N-poor dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface water during summer, requiring the consumption of inorganic carbon and nitrogen in a ratio exceeding the Redfield ratio. The C:N ratio of bulk DOM is not only different from the Redfield ratio but also variable, i.e. no fixed conversion factor of C and N exists where DOM is important in C and N transformations. The existence of N-poor DOM is recognized as a feature typical of oligotrophic systems. At the same time, the C:N ratios of particles conform to Redfield stoichiometry as does deep-ocean chemistry. The implications of this finding are discussed, the conclusion being that, while DOM buildup contributes to CO, drawdown seasonally, its impact on long-term carbon and nitrogen balance of the ocean is small.

Over this period no change was detectable in the structure of the water masses below the deep winter mixed layer. The N: P (dissolved nitrate-to-phosphate) ratio changed from 16 at 100-m depth to less than 15 at 3300-m depth. At intermediate depths nutrient and oxygen data indicate the presence of Mediterranean Outflow water overlying Labrador Sea Water at its most eastern extension. Estimated maximum levels of production in the spring bloom are the total N-limited new primary production equivalent between 24 and 41 gCm(-2), the equivalent maximum diatom production is 11 gC m(-2). Measurements during the spring bloom suggest a conversion factor of 1 muM nitrate to 1 mu gl(-1) chlorophyll, at the shelf break, which is consistent with other recent measurements in European shelf seawaters. Sediment trap data suggest that 80% (5.4 gm(-2)) of the opal produced in the spring bloom dissolved before reaching the sediment trap at 600 m. A comparison of the winter and summer profiles for dissolved silicon suggests a similar dissolution of 9 +/- 3 g opal m(-2) above 300-m depth. Measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in September 1994 show an enrichment of 7 muM-C above the seasonal thermocline relative to the winter values (52 +/- 4 muM). In winter dissolved organic nitrogen represents 40% of the pool of total dissolved nitrogen. There is no consistent evidence of an increase in the concentration of DON during summer. Measurements of nitrate in surface waters in January 1994 show that concentrations off-shelf vary with the temperature of the water and are related to the depth of winter mixing. Mixing in surface waters is discontinuous at the shelf break, demonstrating the degree to which exchange across the shelf break is limited even in winter. OMEX winter measurements of nitrate concentrations can be used to estimate the flow of water across the shelf break that would be required to maintain the nitrogen balance in the North Sea at a steady state. The estimate is 0.6 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6)m(3)s(-1)), which is similar to an earlier estimate of a total flow of 1.7 Sv based on salt budgets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated the effect of refractory dissolved organic matter (refractory DOM: fulvic acids (FAs) and ultrafiltrates (UFs)), isolated from five different sources, on the reproduction of the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Nematodes were exposed to DOM (0.5-64 mg L(-1) dissolved organic carbon) during a whole life cycle (72 h). At the end of the test, the number of offspring per worm was determined. 2. We also studied the effect of refractory DOM on abundance, cell size, and activity of the bacteria (Escherichia coli) that were used as a food source for the nematodes, to assess possible indirect effects of DOM via the food organisms. 3. The effects of DOM on the reproduction of C. elegans varied, depending on the origin and concentration of DOM. FAs isolated from a soil leachate and from the effluent of a waste water plant, as well as UFs from a humic lake and from a marsh, stimulated the reproduction of C. elegans. FAs from ground water had no effect, while FAs from a humic lake inhibited the reproduction of the nematodes. All effects occurred at ecologically relevant DOM concentrations and showed clear dose-response relationships. 4. Neither bacterial abundance nor cell size were influenced by refractory DOM. Bacterial activity was unaffected by four types of DOM. Only FAs from the humic lake caused a significant decrease in bacterial activity over 72 h. 5. The negative effect of FAs from the humic lake on nematode reproduction may be a consequence of a lower bacterial activity in this treatment. The positive effects of refractory DOM, however, could not be related to bacterial parameters. Therefore, we assume that the DOM directly influenced the reproduction of C. elegans. We speculate that refractory DOM can potentially be an additional carbon source or a source of trace nutrients influencing the reproduction of C. elegans. Adsorption of refractory DOM on bacterial cells, serving as food for the nematodes, may have been an important factor for the availability of DOM for C. elegans.

Microbially derived fulvic acids have fluorophores with a more sharply defined emission peak occurring at lower wavelengths than fluorophores in terrestrially derived fulvic acids. We show that the ratio of the emission intensity at a wavelength of 450 nm to that at 500 nm, obtained with an excitation of 370 nm, can serve as a simple index to distinguish sources of isolated aquatic fulvic acids. In our study, this index has a value of similar to1.9 for microbially derived fulvic acids and a value of similar to1.4 for terrestrially derived fulvic acids. Fulvic acids isolated from four large rivers in the United States have fluorescence index values of 1.4-1.5, consistent with predominantly terrestrial sources. For fulvic acid samples isolated from a river, lakes, and groundwaters in a forested watershed, the fluorescence index varied in a manner suggesting different sources far the seepage and streamfed lakes. Furthermore, we identified these distinctive fluorophores in filtered whole water samples from lakes in a desert oasis in Antarctica and in filtered whole water samples collected during snowmelt from a Rocky Mountain stream.

J	Page, DW; van Leeuwen, JA; Spark, KM; Mulcahy, DE				Page, DW; van Leeuwen, JA; Spark, KM; Mulcahy, DE			Tracing terrestrial compounds leaching from two reservoir catchments as input to dissolved organic matter	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Conventional pyrolysis-GC-MS, thermochemolysis and alkaline CuO oxidation were applied to determine differences between dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial plants, soil horizons and drinking water reservoirs in two catchments in South Australia. These two reservoir-catchment systems were selected on the basis of contrasting vegetation and land use. Pyrolysis of DOM yielded furans, aliphatic products and N-containing compounds, which are indicative of polysaccharides, lipids and proteins, respectively. Thermochemolysis enabled detection of methoxy-benzyl compounds derived from various sources of DOM, indicating that these compounds can be used as bio-markers of vascular plant sources. Vanillic acid was detected from DOM isolates from the vegetation, soils and reservoir waters of the two catchments, using CuO oxidation, and hence this compound also appears to be a suitable bio-marker for tracing allochthonous DOM input into the reservoirs. Each of the three techniques resulted in the formation of different compounds from the DOM isolates, which indicated the type of precursor bio-polymer and/or some of the methoxyphenol structures of lignin.				van Leeuwen, John/G-3155-2011; Page, Declan/F-2566-2011	Page, Declan/0000-0002-4902-3911												1323-1650						2001	52	2					223	233		10.1071/MF00058						WOS:000167473100006		
J	Van Wambeke, F; Goutx, M; Striby, L; Sempere, R; Vidussi, F				Van Wambeke, F; Goutx, M; Striby, L; Sempere, R; Vidussi, F			Bacterial dynamics during the transition from spring bloom to oligotrophy in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea: relationships with particulate detritus and dissolved organic matter	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The variability in microbial communities (abundance and biomass), bacterial production and ectoaminopeptidase activity, particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC, DOG), and particulate and dissolved lipids was examined in spring 1995 in the northwestern Mediterranean, where a transition from the end of a bloom to pre-oligotrophic conditions was observed. Four time series of 36 h each and 4 h sampling intervals were performed at 5 m and at the chlorophyll maximum (30 m) between 11 and 31 May. Simultaneous measurements of pigments, abundance of hetero- and autotrophic flagellates, bacteria and POC enabled the estimation of living POC (defined as autotrophic-C plus heterotrophic-C biomass), and thus the detrital organic carbon. During the first 2 time series (11 to 15 May), the bacterial-C biomass was higher than the autotrophic-C biomass at 5 m (ratio 1.4 and 1.7), whereas the opposite trend was observed in the chlorophyll peak (ratio 0.7 for the first cycle). However, at the end of May, autotrophic-C biomass was equivalent to bacterial-C biomass at both depths studied. The detrital pool remained a more or less constant fraction of the POC (52, 53 and 47% on 11-12 May, 14-15 May and 30-31 May) at the chlorophyll peak, whereas it decreased significantly with time (62 to 53%) at 5 m. Relationships between bacterial activities and evolution of available resources were not systematically evidenced from our 36 h diel cycle data. Nevertheless, at the monthly scale, comparison of bacterial carbon demand (BCD) to potential carbon resources (detrital POC and DOG) showed that bacteria fed differently on the various pools. From ectoaminopeptidase turnover rates and detrital POC, the potential hydrolysis rate of detritus was calculated. Depending on the choice of conversion factors for bacterial production and estimates of hydrolysis turnover rates, it was shown that bacterial hydrolysis of detritus could be one of the DOC accumulation sources. We observed that the percentage of BCD supplied by detrital POC hydrolysis increased in the surface and decreased in the chlorophyll peak. An index of lipid degradation in POC, the lipolysis index, increased during the month at 5 m, also indicating a higher hydrolysis of POC. The opposite trend was observed in the chlorophyll maximum layer. The selective decrease in dissolved Lipids in DOC in the chlorophyll maximum layer, particularly free fatty acids, also suggests that bacteria utilized increased fractions of carbon sources from the DOG. We concluded that partitioning between DOC and detritus as resources for bacteria can change during the rapid transition period from mesotrophy to oligotrophy in the northwestern Mediterranean.

J	Lepane, V				Lepane, V			Characterization of Baltic Sea dissolved organic matter as oil shale precursor by separation and fractionation by adsorption chromatographic XAD method, and size exclusion chromatography	OIL SHALE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from Baltic Sea water has been isolated and fractionated by adsorption chromatographic XAD method. The XAD-4 and XAD-2 resins were connected in sequence for increasing the adsorption efficiency. The obtained hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with fluorescence detection at 350 nm excitation and 450 nm emission. The percentages of each fraction were estimated using indirect method via size exclusion peak areas. The increased separation efficiency obtained in the present study allowed to separate exclusion peak into several molecular weight fractions. The average molecular weights (weight-average and number-average) were calculated for different size fractions using polystyrene sulfonates as standard substances. The weight-average molecular weight for the fraction of humic substances was found to be characteristic to aquatic fulvic acids.																	0208-189X	1736-7492					2001	18	3					239	257								WOS:000171193200008		
J	Lepane, V; Kudrjashova, M				Lepane, V; Kudrjashova, M			High-performance size exclusion chromatographic characterization of humic substances and dissolved organic matter from Baltic aquatic environment	OIL SHALE												In the present study the number-average molecular weights (M) over bar (n) and weight-average molecular weights (M) over bar (w) of dissolved organic matter and humic substances from different aquatic environment were determined by highperformance size exclusion chromatography. Seawater samples from the low salinity Baltic Sea, Kattegatt and Skagerrak were analyzed ky HPSEC with fluorescence detection at excitation/emission wavelengths 350/450 and 310/450 nm. UV detection at 254 nm has been used for characterization of other aquatic HS samples from Estonia. The weight- and number-average molecular weights were calculated using polystyrene sulfonates and proteins as standard substances. Due to the enhanced separation efficiency obtained by experimental conditions used (0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8), defined molecular weight fractions were separated in seawater DOM. The weight-average molecular weight for seawater DOM was in the range 600-1300. Multivariate classification and comparison by principal component analysis has been carried out on the data including 24 physical-and-chemical parameters of seawater samples. The plot of scores on the first two principal components revealed the clear grouping of samples in dependence on the sea region as well as on the depth of sampling. The plot of loadings allowed estimating the major variables, which are responsible for this grouping and to interpret the results basing on the knowledge of the biochemical processes occurring in the marine ecosystem.																	0208-189X	1736-7492					2001	18	4					350	372								WOS:000172911200007		
J	Burdige, DJ				Burdige, DJ			Dissolved organic matter in Chesapeake Bay sediment pore waters	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Results of recent studies of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Chesapeake Bay sediment pore waters are summarized here, to gain further insights into the controls on the composition and reactivity of estuarine pore water DOM. This analysis shows that much of the DOM accumulating in sediment pore waters appears to be refractory and of relatively low molecular weight (less than similar to3 kDa), consistent with recent water column DOM studies. Comparative analyses of pore water DOM data from bioturbated/bioirrigated sediments versus anoxic (i.e. non-bioturbated/bioirrigated) sediments indicate that differences in the physical and biogeochemical processes in these sediments lead to distinct differences in DOM concentrations and composition. The causative factors here appear to be both the presence/absence of macrofauna in the sediments, as well as differences in sediment redox conditions (more strictly anoxic vs. "mixed" redox conditions). These observations further suggest that differences in DOM composition and reactivity as a result of varying sediment redox conditions might also play a role in how sediment redox conditions affect overall sediment carbon preservation.

J	Harvey, HR; Mannino, A				Harvey, HR; Mannino, A			The chemical composition and cycling of particulate and macromolecular dissolved organic matter in temperate estuaries as revealed by molecular organic tracers	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We have examined high molecular weight dissolved organic matter collected seasonally throughout the 200 km Delaware Estuary and nearby coastal ocean and compared its organic composition to pal-tides collected in parallel. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was collected and fractionated by ultrafiltration into 1-30 kDa (HDOM) and 30 kDa - 0.2 mum (VHDOM) molecular weight fractions. For one time period (June 1996) a suite of analytical methods was used to characterize dissolved and particulate fractions in derail and to provide complementary information on sources, impact of biological processing and the transport of organic material through the estuarine interface. Substantial, yet variable, portions of organic carbon were identified as carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids and lignin phenols, accounting for 30-90% of POC, 42-67% of VHDOM-C and 14-39% of HDOM-C. The average composition of organic material in Delaware Bay included 32% POC, 1.3% VHDOM, 23% HDOM and 42% LDOM (<1 kDa). Among these fractions, HDOM appears to mix most conservatively, with a strong negative relationship with salinity and a distinct chemical character. Comparisons of the Delaware with other systems indicate that carbohydrates are the main component of total DOM and its high molecular weight fractions which can be characterized, followed by total hydrolyzable amino acids, Lipids are universally low in those systems where they have been examined, bur show an increase in concentration with molecular weight as well as increased presence of labile components. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Benner, R; Opsahl, S				Benner, R; Opsahl, S			Molecular indicators of the sources and transformations of dissolved organic matter in the Mississippi river plume	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Mississippi river plume were investigated during four cruises to the region in 1990-1993. During each cruise, large-volume water samples were collected from a broad salinity gradient (0-36 psu) for the determination of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the isolation of DOM by tangential-now ultrafiltration. The fraction of DOC recovered by ultrafiltration ranged from 49% in the river to 22% in the Gulf of Mexico. The ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) was further characterized for the concentrations and compositions of combined neutral sugars and lignin-derived phenols. Concentrations of DOC ranged from 359 muM in the river during the summer to 65 muM in surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico during the winter. Mixing curves indicated minor losses of DOC at low salinities and a major source of DOC at mid salinities. Combined neutral sugars had elevated concentrations at mid salinities where plankton biomass and rates of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes were maximal, indicating that elevated concentrations of sugars and DOC were freshly-derived from plankton. In contrast, concentrations of lignin phenols ill UDOM were depicted at low salinities, indicating losses due to flocculation of terrestrially-derived humic substances. The selective removal of syringyl phenols from dissolved lignin was observed in UDOM from higher salinity (> 25 psu) waters, providing the first molecular evidence of the removal of terrigenous DOM from the coastal ocean due to photooxidation. Together, these molecular biomarkers indicated much greater dynamic behavior of DOM than was apparent from bulk DOC analyses, and they demonstrated that biological as well as physico-chemical processes were important in controlling the concentrations and compositions of DOM in coastal waters.

Our optical measurements and modelling results indicate that the ozone-related UV-B influence on food web processes in the Arctic Ocean is likely to be small relative to the effects caused by variation in the concentrations of natural UV-absorbing compounds, known as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), that enter the Arctic basin via its large river inflows. The aim of our present study was to develop and apply a simple bio-optical index that takes into account the combined effects of attenuation by atmospheric ozone and water column CDOM, and photobiological weighting for high-latitude environments such as the Arctic Ocean. To this end, we computed values for a biologically effective UV dose rate parameter ("weighted transparency" or T*) based on underwater UV measurements in high-latitude lakes and rivers that discharge into the Arctic Ocean; measured incident UV radiation at Barrow, Alaska: and published biological weighting curves for UV-induced DNA damage and UV photoinhibition of photosynthesis. The results underscore how strongly the Arctic Ocean is influenced by riverine inputs: shifts in CDOM loading (e.g., through climate change, land-use practices, or changes in ocean circulation) can cause variations in biological UV exposure of much greater magnitude than ozone-related effects.

J	Whitehead, K; Vernet, M				Whitehead, K; Vernet, M			Influence of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) on UV absorption by particulate and dissolved organic matter in La Jolla Bay	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Experimental work with cultures of the red tide dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum suggested mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are a component of the organic matter excreted by cells. MAAs in dissolved organic matter (DOM) also may have it large influence on absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light through the water column. To test these hypotheses in a natural setting, data were collected from March 1995 through April 1996 in coastal waters off California, U.S.A. During this time, a large red tide of L. polyedrum occurred in March and April 1995. In this field study, we show that MAAs are a quantifiable component of DOM, particularly during the period following the red tide events. Absorption spectra of particulate organic matter (POM) and DOM samples revealed disproportionately high levels of UV absorption relative to visible wavelengths. UV absorption by POM at 330 nm was linearly related to phytoplankton biomass (between 0-10 mug chlorophyll [Chl] a L-1), measured as Chi a, accounting for 71% of the variability in absorption. Chromatographic analyses revealed the presence of various MAAs in both POM and DOM pools. MAAs were observed in 83% (n = 53) and 47% (n = 13) of the samples analyzed with concentrations ranging from 0 to 2.75 muM (0-696.00 mu mol mug(-1) Chi a) in the POM and 0 to 111.40 nM in the DOM fraction. Absorption by dissolved MAAs, as calculated from the measured concentrations, correlated with DOM UV absorption (r(2) = 0.77) and accounted for up to 10% of the total DOM absorption at 330 nm. Thus, MAAs are a small but quantifiable component of the DOM pool in the field and contribute to UV absorption.																	0024-3590					DEC	2000	45	8					1788	1796								WOS:000165834700012		
J	Rose-Janes, NG; Playle, RC				Rose-Janes, NG; Playle, RC			Protection by two complexing agents, thiosulphate and dissolved organic matter, against the physiological effects of silver nitrate to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in ion-poor water	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed in ion-poor water (similar to 50 mu M Ca) to silver added as AgNO3 or to AgNO3 plus either thiosulphate (Na2S2O3) pr dissolved organic matter (DOM). The effects of these exposures were assessed through repetitive blood sampling over 4 days. Trout exposed to 0.1 mu M AgNO3 alone accumulated large amounts of Ag on their gills and in their plasma, showed progressive losses of plasma Ma and Cl, and had elevated concentrations of plasma glucose. In one set of exposures trout exposed to AgNO3 alone also had increased cough rates, slightly higher ventilation rates, somewhat lower arterial oxygen tensions, and increased blood lactate concentrations. In contrast, trout exposed to 0.1 mu M AgNO3 plus 5 mu M thiosulphate or 35 mg C l(-1) DOM accumulated less Ag on their gills and in their plasma, and showed no adverse ionoregulatory or respiratory effects due to Ag. These results demonstrate ionoregulatory and sometimes respiratory effects in fish exposed to ionic Ag+ in ion-poor water, depending on water chemistry, and demonstrate the protective effects of synthetic and natural complexing agents through a reduction in the amount of ionic Ag+ available to bind at the gills.

A sandy soil (TR) and a sandy-clay soil with a relatively high montmorillonite content (A) were treated with the diverse OA. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted from the amendments, the soils, and the amended soils and studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. A humification index (HIX) was calculated from the fluorescence data. Sorption was determined with the batch technique. Spectroscopical studies revealed that the DOM of the LF differs from the other OA by having a very low ability to absorb and to fluoresce and by its very low HIX values, which indicates that the LF contains large amounts of nonhumified material and consists of small molecules. On the other hand, the SF amendment contains the highest amounts of highly humified material and a large number of carboxylic groups. Amended soils sorbed simazine and 2,4-D to a greater extent than the untreated soils, except in the case of simazine sorption in the LF amended soil A, which had a lower simazine sorption than the original soil. The small molecules of DOM in the LF compete with simazine for montmorillonite sorption sites in soil A. This is not the case for 2,4-D, since this herbicide does not sorb on montmorillonite. In the case of the soil TR, with a lower montmorillonite content, there is no competition between simazine and the LF molecules for sorption sites. Soils amended with the highly humified SF were the best sorbents for simazine but not for 2,4-D, which can be attributed to repulsion between negatively charged 2,4-D molecules and COO- groups, which are more abundant in SF.

We determined the rate of release and microbial uptake of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached from three components (leaves, bark and twigs) of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forest litter originating from different parts of a floodplain and under different oxygen levels. 2. Preliminary experiments showed that substantially more DOC was released from leaves than from bark or twigs; there was relatively little DOC release from coarse particulate matter or soil. 3. Both the amount of DOC released from each litter component and the amount metabolized by the microbial community were independent of position on the floodplain or amount of oxygen available to microbes. 4. Although the bioavailability of DOC was independent of oxygen concentration, the microbial utilization of DOC under aerobic and anaerobic conditions differed. Under aerobic conditions, leaves were colonized by fungi, while bacteria were dominant under anoxic conditions. 5. Phospholipid fatty acid profiles of the microbial communities growing on leaf extracts showed that different microbial communities developed in each oxygen concentration treatment suggesting that, irrespective of flood conditions, a microbial community will develop to utilize a significant proportion of the DOC leached from litter.

J	Zhou, LX; Wong, JWC				Zhou, LX; Wong, JWC			Microbial decomposition of dissolved organic matter and its control during a sorption experiment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												This paper describes a detailed investigation on the effect of microbial activity on apparent dissolved organic matter (DOM) sorption in batch experiments and means to control it. The adsorption and decomposition dynamics of DOM derived from three organic wastes (green manure, pig manure, and sewage sludge) were performed at 4 or 22 degreesC in the presence and absence of 5 mM NaN3. No DOM decomposition occurred in sorption experiments performed at 4 or 22 degreesC receiving NaN3, while significant reduction was noted at 22 degreesC without NaN3 addition after 24 h shaking. The sequence of DOM susceptibility to microbial decomposition in a 24-h period was: green manure > pig manure > sewage sludge. A shaking period of 2 h was found too short for notable microbial activity as compared with that of 24 h shaking but long enough to achieve equilibrium adsorption at 22 degreesC. Therefore, sorption experiments performed at ambient temperatures with a long equilibrium period will overestimate the amount of DOM adsorbed and lead to an incorrect interpretation of the DOM adsorption behavior because of the involvement of microbial dec ay of DOM. It is recommended that batch equilibrium DOM adsorption studies be performed at either 4 degreesC for 24 h or at ambient temperatures for 2 h, while addition of 2.5 to 5 mM of NaN3, is also a possible alternative for an equilibrium period of >2 h.

J	Nelson, SD; Farmer, WJ; Letey, J; Williams, CF				Nelson, SD; Farmer, WJ; Letey, J; Williams, CF			Stability and mobility of napropamide complexed with dissolved organic matter in soil columns	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The herbicide napropamide [N,N-diethyl-2-(1-naphthyloxy)propanamide] has been shown to complex with various sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM), potentially increasing the risk of ground eater contamination by facilitating napropamide transport through soil. Two factors that may reduce the threat of facilitated transport of chemicals through soils are soil profile depth and soil horizon variability, Movement through the soil profile may cause herbicide complexed with DOM to break apart and readsorb to the soil. Differences in soil horizon organic matter content throughout the soil profile may also alter the potential for facilitated transport of herbicides. Napropamide was used in column studies to determine if organic matter differences in horizons and soil profile depth would reduce the risk of facilitated transport. A silt loam soil was used with and without sewage sludge amendment (SS and NoSS) to represent differences in organic matter content. Results showed that <6% of the applied mass of napropamide moved as DOM complexes through soil. The majority of complexed napropamide was very stable and relatively nonadsorbing in solution such that doubling of soil depth only reduced facilitated transport by 20% or less, We present evidence to show that napropamide-DOM complexes are relatively nonadsorbing in solution and exhibit transport characteristics similar to those of a inert compounds in soil solution.																	0047-2425					NOV-DEC	2000	29	6					1856	1862								WOS:000165364200018		
J	Seol, Y; Lee, LS				Seol, Y; Lee, LS			Effect of dissolved organic matter in treated effluents on sorption of atrazine and prometryn by soils	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The apparent enhanced transport of soil-applied atrazine following irrigation of treated effluents has been hypothesized to be from complexation of atrazine with effluent-borne dissolved organic matter (DOM). Under long-term effluent irrigation, even small DOM-induced decreases in pesticide sorption can result in significant enhanced pesticide movement due to cumulative effects. The effect of atrazine and prometryn association with DOM extracted from municipal wastewater (MW), swine-derived lagoon wastewater (SW), and dissolved Aldrich humic acid (HA) on sorption by two seas was measured in batch equilibration studies. Individual association of pesticides to DOM, sorption of DOM to soil, and pesticide sorption by soil were also quantified. Pesticide association to DOM normalized to organic carbon (OC) ranged from 30 to 1000 L/kg OC. DOM sorption by soil ranged from 1.5 to 10 L/kg with a silt loam having a higher affinity for the DOM than the sandy loam. DOM up to 150 mg OC/L did not significantly suppress sorption by soils of either atrazine or prometryne in agreement with predictions using the independently measured binary distribution coefficients in a model that assumed linear equilibrium behavior among pesticide, soil, and DOM. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the same model to identify what combination of soil, pesticide, and DOC variables may suppress sorption, resulting in facilitated transport. Results from the sensitivity analysis are presented and the potential for effluent properties other than DOM to facilitate pesticide transport is discussed.																	0361-5995					NOV-DEC	2000	64	6					1976	1983								WOS:000166023900011		
J	Mitra, S; Bianchi, TS; Guo, LD; Santschi, PH				Mitra, S; Bianchi, TS; Guo, LD; Santschi, PH			Terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter in the Chesapeake Bay and the Middle Atlantic Blight	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Concentrations of lignin-phenols were analyzed in high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (0.2 mu m > HMW DOM > 1 kDa) isolated from surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay (C. Bay), and surface and bottom waters of the Middle Atlantic Eight (MAB). The abundance of lignin-phenols in HMW DOM was higher in the C. Bay (0.128 +/- 0.06 mu g L-1) compared to MAB surface waters (0.016 +/- 0.004 mu g L-1) and MAB bottom waters (0.005 +/- 0.003 mu g L-1). On an organic carbon-normalized basis, lignin-phenol abundances in the HMW DOM (i.e., Lambda(6)), were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in bottom waters compared to sediments at some stations in the MAB. Ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols (SN) in HMW DOM, indicative of angiosperm-derived lignin, ranged from 0.165 to 0.422 in C. Bay, 0.100 to 0.314 in MAB surface waters, and 0.076 to 0.357 in MAB bottom waters. Ratios of vanillic acid to vanillin (Ad/Al)(V) in HMW DOM, indicative of lignin decay, ranged from 0.611 to 1.37 in C. Bay, 0.534 to 2.62 in MAB surface waters, and 0.435 to 1.96 in MAB bottom water. Ratios of SN and (Ad/Al), showed no significant differences between each environment, providing no evidence of any compositionally distinct input of terrestrial organic matter into each environment. When considering depth profiles of suspended particulate matter in the MAB, with C:N ratios, and bulk radiocarbon ages and stable carbon isotopic values in HMW DOM isolated from these areas, two scenarios present themselves regarding the sources and transport of terrestrially derived HMW DOM in the MAB. Scenario #1 assumes that a low amount of refractory terrestrial organic matter and old DOC are uniformly distributed in the oceans, both in surface and bottom waters, and that primary production in surface waters increases DOC with low lignin and younger DOC which degrades easily. In this case, many of the trends in age and biomarker composition likely reflect general patterns of Atlantic Ocean surface and bottom water circulation in the area of the MAB. Scenario 2 assumes terrestrial organic matter in bottom waters of the MAB may have originated from weathered shelf and slope sediments in nearshore areas via a combination of mechanisms (e.g., diffusion, recent resuspension events, and/or desorption of DOM from riverine POM buried deep in these sites) and entered bottom waters offshore in the MAB by diffusion along isopycnal surfaces. These results complement recent work which proposes that transport of DOM across continental shelves may be a significant source of "old" organic matter to the deep ocean.

In this study, the kinetics of soil organic matter (SOM) dissolution fi;om a sandy forest soil was investigated under different electrolyte conditions, using a continuous extraction method. The mathematical analysis of the concentration signal obtained from extractions with constant flow rates and after sudden flow rate changes showed that the dissolution of SOM is diffusion limited. The dissolution rate was lower during extraction with 0.01 M CaCl2. The reaction on sudden flow rate changes was slower when extracting with 0.01 M CaCl2 as compared to water, and the mechanism was different. These observations were explained by a gel phase developing in the swelling SOM. The lower dissolution rates found for extractions with 0.01 M CaCl2 could indicate a more stable gel structure in the presence Ca2+. The development of the gel phase may be influenced by mechanical strain due to increased flow rates.

J	Kaiser, K; Zech, W				Kaiser, K; Zech, W			Dissolved organic matter sorption by mineral constituents of subsoil clay fractions	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENERNAHRUNG UND BODENKUNDE												The retention of dissolved organic matter in soils is mainly attributed to interactions with the clay fraction. Yet, it is unclear to which extent certain clay-sized soil constituents contribute to the sorption of dissolved organic matter. In order to identify the mineral constituents controlling the sorption of dissolved organic matter, we carried out experiments on bulk samples and differently pretreated clay-size separates (untreated, organic matter oxidation with H2O2, and organic matter oxidation with H2O2 + extraction of At and Fe oxides) from subsoil horizons of four Inceptisols and one Alfisol. The untreated clay separates of the subsoils sorbed 85 to 95% of the dissolved organic matter the whole soil sorbed. The sorption of the clay fraction increased when indigenous organic matter was oxidized by H2O2. Subsequent extraction of Al and Fe oxides/hydroxides caused a sharp decrease of the sorption of dissolved organic matter. This indicated that these oxides/ hydroxides in the clay fraction were the main sorbents of dissolved organic matter of the investigated soils. Moreover, the coverage of these sorbents with organic matter reduced the amount of binding sites available for further sorption. The non-expandable layer silicates, which dominated the investigated clay fractions, exhibited a weak sorption of dissolved organic matter. Whole soils and untreated clay fractions favored the sorption of "hydrophobic" dissolved organic matter. The removal of oxides/hydroxides reduced the sorption of the lignin-derived "hydrophobic" dissolved organic matter onto the remaining layer silicates stronger than that of "hydrophilic" dissolved organic matter.

NOM from New Jersey surface water sources were isolated and fractionated by resin adsorption techniques into hydrophobic acid, hydrophobic neutral, hydrophobic base, hydrophilic acid, hydrophilic neutral and hydrophilic base. The Spectral Fluorescent Signatures (SFS) technique through a database of spectral characteristics specific to each fraction was developed for the identification of the six dissolved organic carbon (DOM) fractions. Among the main advantages of the technique are high sensitivity and rapid identification.

J	Moran, MA; Sheldon, WM; Zepp, RG				Moran, MA; Sheldon, WM; Zepp, RG			Carbon loss and optical property changes during long-term photochemical and biological degradation of estuarine dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) impacts the optical properties of coastal seawater and affects carbon cycling on a global scale. We studied sequential long-term photochemical and biological degradation of estuarine dissolved organic matter from the Satilla River, an estuary in the southeastern United States that is dominated by vascular plant-derived organic matter. During photodegradation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss (amounting to 31% of the initial DOC) was much less extensive than colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) or fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) loss (50% and 56% of the initial CDOM and FDOM), and analysis of kinetics suggested a reservoir of DOC that was resistant to photodegradation. In contrast, CDOM photodegradation closely followed first-order kinetics over two hall-lives with no indication of a nondegradable component. FDOM loss was slightly biased toward fluorophores considered representative of terrestrial humic substances. Additional changes in optical properties included increases in spectral slope and shifts in fluorescence excitation/emission maxima that were generally consistent with previous observations from field studies of photobleached DOM. Biological degradation of photobleached DOM was more rapid than that of unbleached material, and this net positive effect was evident even for extensively photodegraded material. Bacterial degradation caused shifts in the opposite direction from photochemical degradation for both spectral slope and excitation/emission maxima and thus dampened but did not eliminate changes in optical properties caused by photobleaching.

Results of absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy analyses and determination of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration showed that the injection of riverine colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) strongly affected the optical properties and DOC concentrations over the shelf. Riverborne nutrients contributed to an increase hi primary productivity. However, during the study period, the increase in primary productivity did not result in the production of significant amounts of CDOM. Fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that optical properties of riverine CDOM were lost close to the mouth of the rivers. A simple mathematical model describing mixing between riverine and marine end-members demonstrated that most of the observed changes in optical properties of CDOM along salinity gradients can be explained by mixing. Laboratory mixing experiments between riverine water and seawater indicated that flocculation of organic matter during estuarine mixing did not affect the optical properties of CDOM.

J	Nambu, K; Yonebayashi, K				Nambu, K; Yonebayashi, K			Quantitative relationship between soil properties and adsorption of dissolved organic matter onto volcanic ash and non-volcanic ash soils	SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												The formation of soil organo-mineral complexes is a key reaction in the carbon cycle in soil, since organic materials acquire a resistance to decomposition due to the formation of the complexes. Adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) onto soil minerals provides a model of this important process. Adsorption of DOM onto samples from Andisols, Inceptisols, and Entisols in batch experiments was compared in terms of the quantitative relationship between the soil properties and the adsorption behavior of DOM. Adsorption behavior was effectively described by a linear initial mass (IM) isotherm, indicating that the adsorption efficiency did not appreciably decline in the range studied even though a large amount of DOM was applied to the soil samples. Samples from Andisols showed a particularly high efficiency of adsorption compared with those from other soils which contained a comparable amount of organic carbon. Explanatory variables useful to predict the efficiency parameter were investigated in 2 steps: firstly the degree of carbon accumulation in the soil samples was examined, and next an index for the amount of ligand exchange sites was examined in combination with the former indices. As a result, an index comprising the total carbon/clay (or total carbon/specific surface area) ratio and the amount of hydroxy ions in the soil extracts with NaF solution was eventually detected. The former represents the degree of carbon occupation on the soil surface, and the latter the amount of ligand exchange sites on labile aluminum. Although the mechanisms involved in the adsorption varied among soils, the selected index was significantly correlated with the adsorption efficiency.																	0038-0768					SEP	2000	46	3					559	569								WOS:000089096300001

All samples showed highest loss of UV-C (220-280 nm) stimulated fluorescence, even when irradiated at 390 nm, with lower loss of UV-B (280-320 nm) stimulated fluorescence centered around the wavelength used for degradation. In contrast to spectra for the initial and residual fingerprints, loss spectra showed the rounded contours expected for a pure organic fluorophore. These observations suggest that laser irradiation targets a specific fluorophore or restricted group of fluorophores in the original mixture, some of which have a double excitation maximum and single emission maximum. By varying the degradation wavelength, eight distinct fluorophore groups were identified in the sample set, some of which were unique to either river or estuarine samples and some of which were common to samples from both environments.																	0013-936X					AUG 1	2000	34	15					3283	3290		10.1021/es9911263						WOS:000088561100050		
J	Stedmon, CA; Markager, S; Kaas, H				Stedmon, CA; Markager, S; Kaas, H			Optical properties and signatures of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Danish coastal waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Danish estuaries and coastal waters were investigated. A new method for estimating the spectral slope coefficient (S) was examined and found to give a closer fit for the measured absorption (92% reduction in sum of residuals) than the traditional method. The spectral pattern in residuals produced by the new technique enabled the identification of CDOM originating from areas of different land uses/types where S coefficients were similar. S values were found to behave conservatively with respect to salinity in all waters except for the off-shore North Sea region where CDOM from marine sources was suspected to have more influence. The specific absorption coefficient of CDOM did not vary significantly in Danish coastal waters. These waters are of particular interest in bio-optical studies as they allow the study of CDOM across a gradient from estuarine, brackish to near-oceanic environments. The results demonstrate that it is possible to develop regional models for the optical properties of CDOM which would then allow higher precision in remote sensing applications.

J	Klinkhammer, GP; McManus, J; Colbert, D; Rudnicki, MD				Klinkhammer, GP; McManus, J; Colbert, D; Rudnicki, MD			Behavior of terrestrial dissolved organic matter at the continent-ocean boundary from high-resolution distributions	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												This paper presents distributions of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in the Columbia River estuary and associated coastal plume as determined by in situ measurement with a fiber optic spectrometer. We interpret these data to represent fluorescence from the humic material associated with terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM). We were able to convert FDOM data to quantitative estimates of fluorescent dissolved organic carbon (FDOC) by calibrating our instrument against organic carbon measured by high temperature combustion. The concentration of FDOC in the Columbia River is 140-180 mu M, in agreement with DOC data from several previous investigations and our own high-temperature measurements. This result supports the view that humic fluorescence can be used as an analog for terrestrial DOC in some circumstances. The distribution of FDOM in the estuary is nonlinear when plotted against salinity indicating a source within the estuary. The Aux of DOC from the river was 1040 mols C sec(-1) during our October sampling period. Mass balance calculations show that estuarine source(s) added 14% to this amount. Potential sources of this material are groundwater, intertidal embayments, and in situ production associated with the estuary turbidity maximum (ETM). FDOM-absorbance demonstrates that substantial shifts in fluorescence efficiency occur only in the ETM. This result together with other recent studies suggests that microbial attack of particulate organic carbon in the ETM may be the primary source of excess FDOC in the Columbia estuary. Once FDOM leaves the estuary it mixes into the coastal ocean conservatively with little indication of removal. The presence of three water masses explains most of the variability of FDOM on the shelf. There is a reversal in the slope of the FDOM-salt relationship between Columbia River plume water and deeper shelf water masses. We interpret this bilateral distribution to be the net result of two conservative processes: primary dilution of dissolved fluvial material with coastal surface water and mixing of refractory terrestrial material into the ocean.

J	Zhou, LX; Yang, H; Shen, QR; Wong, MH; Wong, JWC				Zhou, LX; Yang, H; Shen, QR; Wong, MH; Wong, JWC			Fractionation and characterization of dissolved organic matter derived from sewage sludge and composted sludge	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter(DOM) is an important component affecting the availability of heavy metals in sludge-amended soils. In this study, DOM derived from anaerobically digested dewatered sludge and sludge compost were fractionated by a macroreticular exchange resin and characterized by Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) technique to evaluate their potential effects on soil metal mobility. The acid fractions of DOM sludge and sludge compost respectively were 78% and 73%, which included hydrophilic (HiA) and hydrophobic (HoA) adds. The hydrophobic fraction of DOM increased during composting, with the hydrophobic neutral (HoN) and HoA increasing from <1 to 22% and from 38 to 52%. respectively. The relative amount of each component in the hydrophilic fraction of DOM was as follows: hydrophilic add (HiA) >> hydrophilic base (Hig) > hydrophilic neutral (HiN). The HiA, HiB, and HiN fraction of the sludge DOM was 1.9, 6.7, and 2.2 times higher than the respective fractions of the sludge compost DOM. The FT-IR spectrum shows that the hydrophobic fraction had considerably higher aromatic acids or aromatic phenols, while the hydrophilic fraction was richer in carboxyl and polyhydroxyl groups. Sludge DOM appeared to have more C-N and C-O ligand character, possibly from organic acid, amino add, and amines than compost DOM, especially for the HiA, HiB, and HoA fractions. Since the hydrophilic fraction of sewage sludge was higher than that of sludge compost, the addition of savage sludge would likely have a higher ability in reducing the trace metal adsorption capacity of soils as compared to that of sludge compost.

Trace element concentrations in the fractions isolated were analyzed by using ICP-MS. Uranium, molybdenum, and antimony were found to be about 40% associated with fulvic and hydrophilic acids adsorbed on XAD resins at pH 2, the metal-organic association being not dissociated. Much higher percentages of the same elements, plus vanadium, were adsorbed on the DEAE resin at the pH of natural water possibly because of the better preservation of acid labile organic complexes or of the supplementary adsorption of inorganic compounds. Ultrafiltration and dialysis made it possible to exclude colloidal fractions together with much U (78%), Mo (80%), V (55%), and DOC (65%). These elements and many others (including barium) were previously found to be quite reactive at the bottom of the lake, (apparently being scavenged by settling particles, which are mostly diatoms, then dissolved at the sediment-water interface). Conversely, trace elements with a conservative behavior in the bottom layer (such as lithium and cesium) were not found associated with dissolved organic mater (DOM). Barium was not strongly associated with the extractable (DOM), which may argue for a direct interaction with inorganic particles or the existence of very labile complexes, Our work suggests the existence of relatively stable (nonacid labile) U and Mo-DOM colloidal associations in the anoxic bottom waters of the lake and their importance in the scavenging of those metals.																	0024-3590					JUL	2000	45	5					1088	1096								WOS:000088572700007		
J	Marhaba, TF; Van, D				Marhaba, TF; Van, D			The variation of mass and disinfection by-product formation potential of dissolved organic matter fractions along a conventional surface water treatment plant	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) influences many aspects of water treatment, including the formation of potentially harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs) when disinfectants are applied. DOM from a conventional surface water treatment plant (WTP) in Northern New Jersey was isolated and fractionated using resin adsorption chromatography into six different fractions. These fractions are operationally categorized as hydrophobic acid, hydrophobic neutral, hydrophobic base, hydrophilic acid, hydrophilic neutral and hydrophilic base. The hydrophilic acid fraction was found to be the most abundant fraction in the source water. The hydrophilic neutral, hydrophilic acid and hydrophobic acid fractions had the highest removal efficiency through the WTP (about 65%). The variation and removal effectiveness of each fraction along the WTP was studied. Seven-day chlorine DBP formation potential (FP) tests were performed on all DOM fractions through the WTP. For the source water studied, the hydrophilic acid fraction was found to be the most reactive precursor to the trihalomethane (THM) formation. The hydrophobic neutral fraction was found to be the fraction of concern with respect to the FP of haloacetic acids (HAAs) class of DBPs. The FP of each fraction's class of DBPs was found to be amenable for reduction along the treatment train, specifically by coagulation/sedimentation. The fractionated approach concept showed to be very beneficial in the study of DBP precursors and their effective removal by physical and chemical treatment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

These results were directly compared with results from a conventional isolation and characterization procedure of dissolved humic substances (fulvic acids - FA) isolated from the same water sample. FAs were characterized by UV-, fluorescence-, FTIR spectroscopy and elemental composition. UV absorbance and fluorescence behavior of FAs and original water samples follow the same pattern. A lower UV absorbance and a lower humification index (derived from the synchronous fluorescence spectra) of about 15% is typical for water samples compared to the FAs. We computed linear relationships between properties of the original water sample (UV-, synchronous fluorescence spectra) and the isolated FA (IR absorption, C/N ratio). The application of synchronous fluorescence and UV spectroscopy of aqueous samples has been proved to result in similar information about DOM composition as the characterization of isolated humic substances concerning the content of aromatic structures and the degree of humification.

This study was conducted to demonstrate the use batch ultrafiltration data in conjunction with a two-parameter nonlinear permeation coefficient model (PCM) [Logan, B. E.; Jian, Q. J. Environ. Eng. (Reston, Va.) 1990, 116, 1046-1062] to determine distributed and number-average apparent molecular weight (AMW(N)) information for DOM in environmental samples. Batch ultrafiltration data was collected by filtering a natural water and its hydrophobic and hydrophilic acid, base, and neutral DOM subfractions through Amicon YC/YM series membranes. The actual proportion of DOM sized to pass each membrane (C-r0*) was determined using the PCM. The Weibell cumulative distribution function was fit to log-transformed batch ultrafiltration data (log C-r0*) using nonlinear least-squares regression. Best-fit values for Weibell scale (alpha) and shape (beta) parameters were calculated for each log-transformed ultrafiltration data set, from which DOM AMW(N) values were found in the range of 510-3910 Da. R-2 values for all nonlinear regressions were >0.95, indicating that the Weibell distribution adequately described log C-r0* data. Batch ultrafiltration data that has been adjusted for membrane rejection using the PCM may be used to characterize environmental samples that display generally unimodal DOM size distribution.

J	Bertilsson, S; Tranvik, LJ				Bertilsson, S; Tranvik, LJ			Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter in lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In a survey of photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in lake water, we found photochemical production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and low molecular weight carboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic, formic, and acetic acid), upon simulated solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure of filter-sterilized surface water from 38 investigated lakes. Given the large variability in water chemistry of the studied systems, we suggest that these photoproducts are universally produced in sunlight exposed lake water. The measured production of carboxylic acid carbon corresponded to 34.4% (median) of the produced DIC. The production of DIC and carboxylic acids during 8 h of mild UV irradiation corresponded to an average of 4.7% (SD 2.9) of the total dissolved organic carbon pool. Hence, photochemical degradation could be a major sink for DOM in the surface layer of lakes. All photoreaction rates were strongly correlated to the total radiation absorbed during UV exposure (r(2) > 0.8), which depends mainly on amount of colored DOM in the water. The variability in DIC production after normalizing for absorbed radiation energy could partly be attributed to general water chemistry parameters (e.g., pH, iron concentration, conductivity).

J	Mannino, A; Harvey, HR				Mannino, A; Harvey, HR			Biochemical composition of particles and dissolved organic matter along an estuarine gradient: Sources and implications for DOM reactivity	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The chemical composition of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) was examined along the salinity gradient of the Delaware Estuary. DOM was collected and fractionated by tangential-flow ultrafiltration into 1-30 kDa (HDOM; high molecular weight) and 30 kDa to 0.2 mu m (VHDOM; very high molecular weight) and compared to particles collected in parallel. Polysaccharides comprised 12-43% of particulate organic carbon (POC), 30-56% of VHDOM carbon, and 7.5-19% of HDOM carbon. Hydrolyzable amino acids comprised 17-38% of POC, 5.4-12% of VHDOM carbon, and 1.5-4.2% of HDOM carbon. Only 7-43% of dissolved organic nitrogen in VHDOM and HDOM consisted of amino acids, indicating that organic nitrogen is highly modified within the dissolved pool or an unidentified pool of dissolved organic nitrogen exists. The composition of amino acids and distribution of polysaccharides are consistent with enrichment of structural biopolymers from algae and vascular plants within DOM. Proteinaceous matter released during the growth of an axenic diatom culture contains similar amino acid distributions across size fractions as in Delaware Bay samples. The source of organic matter appears to be as important as microbial processing in determining amino acid content and composition of DOM. Shifts in amino acid composition point to contrasting sources and extent of degradation for organic matter along the estuarine gradient and among size fractions. The lower amino acid and carbohydrate content and higher beta-alanine content in HDOM suggests that this fraction is more highly degraded relative to POM and VMDOM and provides geochemical evidence in support of the size-reactivity continuum hypothesis. Spatial patterns in reactivity of organic constituents were also evident with more degraded organic matter in the turbid middle estuary and the release of fresh DOM from diatoms in the lower estuary.

In the coastal European Atlantic area and in the Western Mediterranean Sea (Gulf of Lions), a significant statistical dependence has been found between aCDOM and fluorescence with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The relationship shows that, in the river plume areas (Rhine in the North Sea and Rhone in the Gulf of Lions), a consistent fraction of DOC (from 40% to 60% of the average of the DOC measured) is non-absorbing in visible light range, where the dissolved organic matter (DOM) is typically absorbent. In comparison, in the open sea, apparently not affected by the continental inputs, the entire nOC belongs to the chromophoric DOM whose specific absorption is lower (5 to 10 times) than that found in the river plume areas.

J	Ohlenbusch, G; Kumke, MU; Frimmel, FH				Ohlenbusch, G; Kumke, MU; Frimmel, FH			Sorption of phenols to dissolved organic matter investigated by solid phase microextraction	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The sorption of phenol and different halogenated phenols to natural organic matter of a brown water lake (HO14), of a compost extract, of Aldrich humic acid (Aldrich-HA), and to the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated using solid phase microextraction (SPME). The limit of determination for the SPME analysis was < 15 mu g/l for all phenols investigated. The extraction coefficients K-F were calculated according to a first-order extraction kinetics. In general, the extraction equilibrium was established faster due to the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The highest sorption capacity of phenols was observed for BSA with log K-OC values in the range between 2 and 6. For the compost extract and HO14 only a small sorption of the investigated phenols was determined. On the other hand, Aldrich humic acid showed a reasonable sorption of phenols with log K-OC values between 2 and 3. The sorption to DOM decreased when the pH of the solution was increased.

The dissolved combined amino acid concentrations (DCAA) changed little from year to year 5.3 (3.3-7.6) mg/L. In contrast, the concentration of polysaccharides (DCCHO), probably of allochthonous origin as shown by the low value (0.41) of the ratio alpha-Glucosidase activity/beta-Glucosidase activity (alpha GlcA/beta GlcA) were high in the first pear (0.2-4.7, average 2.4 mg/L) and then decreased greatly. The increase in the Value of the ratio alpha GlcA/beta GlcA (0.75) indicates that there was a change in the origin of the DOM with time. The hydrolytic activities of Leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP), alpha and beta GlcA were particularly high in 1996, being 498.3 (119.4-1302.9), 11.9 (2.4-28.5) and 27.2 (6.5-51.1) nM/h, respectively. Compared to the first year, the hydrolysis activity rates of the second and third years were about two to three times lower. The positive correlations between DCCHO and LAP (r = 0.59, n = 40, P < 0.01), beta GlcA (r = 0.57, n = 40, P < 0.01) and alpha GlcA (r = 0.35, n = 40, P < 0.05), and also between DCCHO and bacterial production (r = 0.49, n = 36, P < 0.05) indicate that enzyme activities and bacterial production were regulated by the supply of polysaccharides. In this type of ecosystem, organic matter, therefore, seems to play a key role in controlling bacterial communities through resources.																	0003-9136					MAY	2000	148	2					231	248								WOS:000087119200004

Water samples were taken approximately monthly from the surface layers of two oligotrophic lakes with contrasting humic content, situated in southern Sweden. Lake water was filter-sterilized (0.2 mum) and exposed to artificial UV radiation in quartz tubes. Potential DOC photodegradation, measured as a photoproduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and oxalic, malonic, formic, and acetic acid in irradiated samples, was observed throughout the sampling period. In addition, exposure to UV radiation resulted in a decrease in DOC, absorbance, and humic substance fluorescence. The photoproduction of DIC and the low molecular weight (LMW) organic acids varied seasonally, being generally higher in winter and spring (December-May), while DOC appeared to become less photoreactive after the extensive exposure to solar radiation during summer. Production rates of both DIC and LMW organic acids were approximately eight times higher in the humic lake despite that the DOC concentration was only two times higher than in the clearwater lake. This is most probably due to the high input of allochthonous DOC and the resulting higher absorbance to DOC ratio in the humic system. Furthermore, the longer hydraulic residence time in the clearwater system could have resulted in an accumulation of residual DOC, recalcitrant to further photodegradation.																	0706-652X					MAY	2000	57	5					875	885		10.1139/cjfas-57-5-875						WOS:000087273200001

Due to this complex chemical composition, the questions of their geographic or climatic specificity as well as their evolution in time due to biodegradation processes will not be explained until a proper method to characterize the leachates is designed. In a previous report [1] we elaborated a new method for the fractionation of organic matter in landfill leachates. Here we present an improved method of DOM spectral characterization based on fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEM) combined with band curve-fitting of the excitation and emission spectra. The fluorescence spectroscopy has proved to be a potent tool in analytical chemistry in various contexts. Particularly, excitation-emission matrices have been used to describe the spectroscopic properties of the organic matter dissolved in fresh or marine waters. High resolution is attained by band curve-fitting which allows resolution, of discrete components that overlap in the experimental emission spectra. Hence, most of the fluorescence excitation/emission maxima related to a sample are determined, even though they do not generate a local maximum in the EEM. The present paper reports an application of this method to the characterization of ultrafiltrated leachates fractions collected in a domestic landfill in Brittany (France).																	0959-3330					MAY	2000	21	5					515	524		10.1080/09593332408618096						WOS:000087138900003		
J	Kogel-Knabner, I; Totsche, KU; Raber, B				Kogel-Knabner, I; Totsche, KU; Raber, B			Desorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from soil in the presence of dissolved organic matter: Effect of solution composition and aging	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the desorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from soil was studied with C-14-benzo[a]pyrene and C-14-pyrene in different soil-aqueous solution systems and after prolonged periods of aging (110 and 216 d). The desorption of C-14-benzo[a]pyrene and C-14-pyrene was strongly affected by the composition and properties of the aqueous phase. Desorption linearly increased with increasing DOM concentrations. Distribution coefficients (log K-OC') for the desorption of C-14-labeled PAHs were about 3.5 (pyrene) and 25 (benzo[a]pyrene) times lower in the presence of DOM. The enhancement of PAM desorption between various types of DOM is controlled by the molecular weight distribution of DOM. Dissolved organic matter with a high proportion of high molecular weight components (>14 000 dalton) has a high affinity for PAHs and thus is more effective in desorbing PAHs from soil. In addition, the desorption of PAHs from soil is controlled by the time elapsed since contamination. In the first 36 d following contamination with C-14-benzo[a]pyrene, a decrease of the PAM concentration that could be desorbed in the solution phase was observed. The desorbable fraction did not show any further changes for up to 183 d after contamination, suggesting a fraction of PAM that is not or very slowly desorbing from soil. The major proportion (>98%) of the desorbable PAM-fraction is apparently bound at sites that show a rate-limited release of PAHs. This is corroborated by the model discrimination conducted with three different models, which favors a two-site equilibrium-nonequilibrium model.

Batch equilibrium and soil column leaching studies were performed to evaluate the effect of a drying event following herbicide application on napropamide-DOM complex formation. Napropamide was applied directly to the soil and allowed to dry and compared with studies where the herbicide was not allowed to dry. In batch studies the presence of napropamide-DOM complexes was inferred from reduced sorption coefficients measured on extracts of treated soils as compared with those from aqueous solutions. In column studies, drying was shown to induce herbicide movement with the wetting front even when preferential flow pathways were eliminated. The formation of napropamide-DOM complexes was verified by dialysis tubing techniques. Increased napropamide movement through soil was the result of stable napropamide-DOM complexes that lacked an adsorption affinity. Although less than 6% of the total herbicide applied moved by facilitated transport, this amount of rapidly mobile pesticide could significantly increase the potential for ground water contamination. Results suggest that preventing the applied herbicide solution from drying before irrigation could reduce or eliminate the threat of facilitated transport of napropamide by DOM. We suggest that a short irrigation period after herbicide application could allow for herbicide movement beyond the soil surface to deter drying while preventing deep movement of pesticide with the water front.																	0047-2425					MAY-JUN	2000	29	3					987	994								WOS:000089412100038		
J	Logan, BE; Wagenseller, GA				Logan, BE; Wagenseller, GA			Molecular size distributions of dissolved organic matter in wastewater transformed by treatment in a full-scale trickling filter	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The performance of biofilm reactors is primarily limited by the rate of diffusion of biodegradable molecules into the biofilm. Wastewater entering and leaving a trickling filter was therefore separated into three molecular weight size fractions of <1000 daltons (<1K), 1 to 10K, and >10K to <0.45 <mu>m, and the concentration of 5-day soluble biochemical oxygen demand (sBOD(5)) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured for each size fraction. On average, a large percentage of both the sBOD(5) (82%) and DOC (78%) was contained in the smallest size fraction (<1K). Removal rates of sBOD(5) were high. Influent sBOD(5) values were reduced from 27.3 to 33.3 mg/L to 4 mg/L in the effluent. A comparison of a trickling filter model (TRIFIL2) indicated that removal rates of sBOD(5) were much greater at this site than was typical of other trickling filters treating domestic wastewater. The large concentration of this small molecular weight fraction was believed to account for greater than normal removal rates. To demonstrate this, the molecular size distributions assumed in the trickling filter model TRIFIL2 were adjusted to fit the measured size distributions. The measured average removal of 92% compared well to the 93% removal predicted by the TRIFIL2 model with these measured molecular size distributions. These measurements and model simulations demonstrate that the performance of trickling filters can be linked directly to physical characteristics of the wastewater such as the molecular size distribution of biodegradable organic matter.

In the experiments, DOM samples of a brown water lake and of commercially available Lignin sulfonic acids were used. Ozonation treatment, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in combination with UV irradiation, and UV irradiation only were applied in the oxidation of the DOM samples. The impact of the oxidation on the DOM was characterized by size exclusion chromatography. UV absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. In order to investigate the flocculation properties of the DOM before and after oxidation, sedimentation field-flow fractionation experiments were performed. The biodegradability was probed in a biofilm reactor. Due to the oxidation, the biodegradability and flocculation was changed depending on the process applied and the degree of oxidation of the DOM.

This technique cleaves ester and ether bonds of bio- and geological macromolecules and releases monomer subunits and methylates them in situ as their methyl ethers and methyl esters. Compared with conventional pyrolysis, TMAH thermochemolysis avoids decarboxylation of preexisting carboxylic moieties and produces aromatic acids as their methyl esters. Various phenolic derivatives, which might originate from incorporated lignin-derived structures, from the highly aliphatic and resistant biopolymer cutan and also from proteinaceous materials, were identified among the products produced from UDOM upon thermochemolysis. The presence of lignin derivatives in UDOM indicates input of organic matter derived from terrestrial sources. Various aromatic acids, perhaps representing the final steps in the oxidation of the side-chain during microbial oxidation of lignin, were released upon TMAH thermochemolysis, suggesting they are structural constituents of the UDOM. Different ratios of lignin-derived materials, commonly determined using the CuO oxidation method, such as the Lambda value, indicative of the amount of lignin present, the acid/aldehyde ratio (Ad/Al)(G), indicative of the extent of oxidative degradation of the lignin component, and the syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) and p-hydroxyphenyl/guaiacyl (P/G) ratios, indicative of the contribution for the different types of lignin, were determined.				de Leeuw, Jan/F-6471-2011; del Rio, Jose/I-8325-2012	del Rio, Jose/0000-0002-3040-6787												0323-4320					APR	2000	28	2					69	76		10.1002/(SICI)1521-401X(20002)28:2<69::AID-AHEH69>3.0.CO;2-L						WOS:000087121600001		
J	Cottrell, MT; Kirchman, DL				Cottrell, MT; Kirchman, DL			Natural assemblages of marine proteobacteria and members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacter cluster consuming low- and high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We used a method that combines microautoradiography with hybridization of fluorescent rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to whole cells (MICRO-FISH) to test the hypothesis that the relative contributions of various phylogenetic groups to the utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) depend solely on their relative abundance in the bacterial community. We found that utilization of even simple low-molecular-weight DOM components by bacteria differed across the major phylogenetic groups and often did not correlate with the relative abundance of these bacterial groups in estuarine and coastal environments. The Cytophaga-Flavobacter cluster was overrepresented in the portion of the assemblage consuming chitin, N-acetylglucosamine, and protein but was generally underrepresented in the assemblage consuming amino acids. The amino acid-consuming assemblage was usually dominated by the alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria, although the representation of alpha-proteobacteria in the protein-consuming assemblages was about that expected from their relative abundance in the entire bacterial community. In our experiments, no phylogenetic group dominated the consumption of all DOM, suggesting that the participation of a diverse assemblage of bacteria is essential for the complete degradation of complex DOM in the oceans. These results also suggest that the role of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in carbon cycling would be more accurately described by using three groups instead of the single bacterial compartment currently used in biogeochemical models.

Few data have been collected pertaining to the dynamics of CDOM in Arctic marine ecosystems and none during the progression of an Arctic polynya. Unlike in other marine ecosystems, ultraviolet absorption by CDOM was highest near the surface of the water column and increased in concert with the development of the polynya. Analysis of ice core samples revealed that sea-ice may be a significant source of CDOM and indicated that Arctic marine ecosystems have different controls of CDOM production and loss than do low latitude, open ocean systems. We hypothesize that the frequent surface CDOM maxima in Arctic ecosystems is the result of sea-ice providing a substrate for enhanced autochthonous formation of CDOM.																	0094-8276					APR 1	2000	27	7					1009	1011		10.1029/1999GL007002						WOS:000086224500026		
J	Kalbitz, K; Solinger, S; Park, JH; Michalzik, B; Matzner, E				Kalbitz, K; Solinger, S; Park, JH; Michalzik, B; Matzner, E			Controls on the dynamics of dissolved organic matter in soils: A review	SOIL SCIENCE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils plays an important role in the biogeochemistry of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, in pedogenesis, and in the transport of pollutants in soils. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent literature about controls on DOM concentrations and fluxes in soils. We focus on comparing results between laboratory and field investigations and on the differences between the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP). Both laboratory and field studies show that litter and humus are the most important DOM sources in soils. However, it is impossible to quantify the individual contributions of each of these sources to DOM release. In addition, it is not clear how changes in the pool sizes of litter or humus may affect DOM release. High microbial activity, high fungal abundance, and any conditions that enhance mineralization all promote high DOM concentrations. However, under field conditions, hydrologic variability in soil horizons with high carbon contents may be more important than biotic controls. In subsoil horizons with low carbon contents, DOM may be adsorbed strongly to mineral surfaces, resulting in low DOM concentrations in the soil solution. There are strong indications that microbial degradation of DOM also controls the fate of DOM in the soil. Laboratory experiments on controls of DOM dynamics have often contradicted field observations, primarily because hydrology has not been taken into account. For example, laboratory findings on the effects of plant species (conifer vs. deciduous) on DOM release from forest floors and on the effects of substrate quality (e.g.: C/N ratio) or pH on DOC concentrations were often not confirmed in field studies. The high adsorption capacity of soil clay minerals and oxides for DOM shown in laboratory studies may not control the transport of DOM in soils in the field if macropore fluxes dominate under field conditions. Laboratory findings about the biodegradability of DOM also await verification under field conditions. Studies that include DON and DOP dynamics in addition to DOC are few. The rate of release and the fate of DOG, DON, and DOP in soils may differ to a far greater extent than previously assumed. Controls established for DOC might thus be not valid for DON and DOP. Despite intensive research in the last decade, our knowledge of the formation and fate of DOM in soils and its response to changing environmental conditions is still fragmented and often inconsistent. Predictions at the field scale are still very uncertain, and most of the information available today is the result of studies on temperate soils and forest ecosystems. Thus, future research on controls of DOM dynamics should be extended to soils under different land uses and in other climate zones. Emphasis should also be given to: (i) the effects of soil organic matter properties on the release of DOM (ii) environmental factors controlling DOM quantity and quality (iii) the assessment of biological versus physico-chemical controls on the release and retention of DOM in soils, and (iv) the differences between DOG, DON, and DOP. Finally, if our goal is to predict DOM concentrations and fluxes in soils, future research on the controls of DOM dynamics should have a strong focus on field studies.

J	Ziegler, S; Benner, R				Ziegler, S; Benner, R			Effects of solar radiation on dissolved organic matter cycling in a subtropical seagrass meadow	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The influence of sunlight on bacterioplankton production was investigated over a 12-month period in Laguna Madre, a shallow, subtropical, seagrass-dominated lagoon in south Texas. Two types of experiments were conducted every 6 to 8 weeks from June 1996 through June 1997 to assess the effect of photochemical transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on bacterial production and the net effect of sunlight exposure on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton production in surface waters. Photobleaching of DOM was observed; however, estimates of the photomineralization of DOM in May and July were very low and indicated that this process could represent at most 3% of water column respiration. Photochemical transformations of DOM did not have any significant effect on bacterioplankton activity. However, bacterial production measured during exposure of water samples to natural sunlight in the summer months, with and without ultraviolet light, was enhanced relative to dark controls. Phytoplankton release of bioavailable substrates appeared to be responsible for light-mediated increases in bacterioplankton production. Bacterio- and phytoplankton were not photoinhibited by exposure to ultraviolet radiation in surface waters. Overall, we observed no indication of photoinhibition of microbial processes in Laguna Madre, and photochemical transformations appeared to play a minor role in the cycling of DOM. The low photoreactivity of DOM in combination with its relatively high bioreactivity appeared responsible for the minor role of photochemical transformations in the cycling of DOM in Laguna Madre.

J	Andrews, SS; Caron, S; Zafiriou, OC				Andrews, SS; Caron, S; Zafiriou, OC			Photochemical oxygen consumption in marine waters: A major sink for colored dissolved organic matter?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Quantification of photochemical O-2 uptake provides a measure of total chemical photooxidation of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Here we study this process and present estimates suggesting that photooxidation has the potential to significantly modify marine DOM pools, complementing or exceeding oxidation via coupled chemical-biological pathways. We measured apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of photobleaching, O-2 uptake, and H2O2 production in several coastal marine samples and in dilutions of a tropical estuarine water with oligotrophic seawater. O-2-loss AQYs varied little among samples or with dilution but decreased linearly from 1.2 x 10(-3) at 300 nm to 0.3 x 10(-3) at 400 nm and dropped about threefold to near-constant values with increasing absorbed light dose. H2O2 production, about 45% of O-2 uptake, showed similar dependencies, whereas singlet oxygen (O-2((1)Delta(g))) reactions contributed less than 1% of O-2 uptake for typical coastal water. Implications of these findings for photochemical O-2, H2O2, and DOM cycling are discussed. Modeling the dose-dependence of O-2 loss and photobleaching at 310 nm required three DOM pools. In the simplest case, about 90% is a weakly absorbing, low-AQY pool of DOM admired with two similar-sized pools of more photochemically reactive DOM. This result suggests that rigorously extrapolating laboratory data to the environment requires detailed mapping of dose-wavelength-photobleaching AQY surfaces. Action spectra and DOM flux estimates for coastal photooxidative chemistry were derived. Site-specific potential rates are comparable to available in situ data. Globally, the DOM photolysis capacity appears to be larger than estimated coastal DOM inputs, especially in tropical and temperate areas, including areas with maximal DOM inputs.																	0024-3590					MAR	2000	45	2					267	277								WOS:000085822300002

The interdependent evolution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll a (CN a), particulate organic carbon (POC), and bacterial abundance-in the mesocosms was followed over a 10-d period. There was a net increase of Chi a, POC, and DOC in all systems over time; however, the slower mixing treatments had less accumulation than the systems with faster mixing. All systems displayed weak correlations of DOC with POC and Chi a. A significant effect of enhanced WE radiation on concentrations of these bulk properties was not observed in any of the mesocosms. A strong correlation of CDOM absorbance loss (photobleaching) with absorbed radiation dose was observed in all treatments, with the fast mixing systems having larger absorbance losses and faster loss rates. Photobleaching was wavelength dependent, resulting in an increase in the spectral slope of CDOM absorption over time. Thus, although CDOM photobleaching may result in deeper penetration of light at all wavelengths, the ratios of UVB to ultraviolet-A (UVA) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) are reduced. The effect of enhanced UVB radiation was unexpected, with no proportional increases in CDOM photo-bleaching in the +UVB treatments. Comparisons of the different treatments indicate that interactions of biological activity, mixing, and the in situ light field can influence CDOM absorbance properties and/or photoreactivity and that there is a possible role for UVB in the production of CDOM.

Semi-continuous monocultures of N. spumigena Mertens were established. The cells were exposed to the following treatments: nutrient-sufficient (+NP), nitrogen-deficient without DOM (-N) and with DOM (-NDOM), and phosphorus-deficient without DOM (-P) and with DOM (-PDOM). The -NDOM treatment had the highest N. spumigena cell density (6.1 x 10(7) cells l(-1)) during the experiment, whereas the P-deficient treatments had the lowest cell numbers (0.53 to 0.66 x 10(7) cells l(-1)). Both -P and -PDOM treatments yielded P-deficient N. spumigena cells. Dissolved organic nitrogen may provide N and increase N. spumigena yield under conditions of N deficiency. On the other hand, N. spumigena cells did not use DOM as a P source.

Singlet oxygen was detected by its infrared phosphorescence at 1270 nm using both steady-state and time-resolved techniques. The O-1(2) quantum yields were corrected for self-quenching of O-1(2) by the DOM substrates. Photogenerated free radicals were monitored dy electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Two size fractions of the dissolved organic matter were examined: material retained with a 3 kDa cut-off filter and material retained with a 1 kDa cut-off filter. The highest O-1(2) quantum yields were found in the lower molecular mass material. Then was little change in the O-1(2) quantum yields with increasing salinity, indicating that the photosensitizing ability of the estuarine DOM does not decrease as terrestrial DOM is transported to sea and mixes with marine DOM. In contrast to O-1(2) formation, the steady-state levels of photoproduced free radicals did not significantly differ between high and low molecular mass DOM, and the levels were substantially higher in riverine DOM than along plume salinity transects. This rapid transition in free radical level suggests that terrestrially-derived DOM experiences significant changes in this aspect of its photoreactivity in low (< 10 ppt) salinity waters.

Field observations have revealed that some pesticides move deeper into the soil profile than would be expected from predictions made by solute transport models. The discrepancies have been attributed to preferential now of water carrying pesticides via macropores in field soils. The same phenomenon may also be explained by transport facilitated by a carrier such as dissolved organic matter (DOM), A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the transport of napropamide [2-(a-naphthoxy-N,N-diethylpropionamide] through soil via DOM, Soils were sieved, packed in columns, and treated at the surface with C-14-labeled napropamide, Water was applied to the columns by flooding and leachate was collected. It was found that C-14-labeled napropamide was present in the first 0.22 cm of leachate. The C-14 and DOM concentrations were highest in the initial leachate and decreased with increasing leachate. Napropamide concentration fell below detection at some depth in all columns and recovery in the soil averaged 95% of the applied napropamide, Gas chromatographic analyses verified that C-14 activity in the leachate was associated with napropamide, A dialysis equilibrium technique determined that 17 to 56% of the napropamide in the leachate was retained inside a 500-Da dialysis membrane. The rapid leaching of a small fraction of napropamide was not a result of preferential flow in our experiments but is due to DOM-facilitated transport. Thus, under field conditions rapid pesticide leaching could be the combined effects of preferential now and facilitated transport.																	0361-5995					MAR-APR	2000	64	2					590	594								WOS:000089446200020		
J	Church, MJ; Hutchins, DA; Ducklow, HW				Church, MJ; Hutchins, DA; Ducklow, HW			Limitation of bacterial growth by dissolved organic matter and iron in the Southern Ocean	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The importance of resource limitation in controlling bacterial growth in the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) region of the Southern Ocean was experimentally determined during February and March 1998. Organic- and inorganic-nutrient enrichment experiments were performed between 42 degrees S and 55 degrees S along 141 degrees E. Bacterial abundance, mean cell volume, and [H-3]thymidine and [H-3]leucine incorporation were measured during 4- to 5-day incubations. Bacterial biomass, production, and rates of growth all responded to organic enrichments in three of the four experiments. These results indicate that bacterial growth was constrained primarily by the availability of dissolved organic matter. Bacterial growth in the subtropical front, subantarctic zone, and subantarctic front responded most favorably to additions of dissolved free amino acids or glucose plus ammonium. Bacterial growth in these regions may be limited by input of both organic matter and reduced nitrogen. Unlike similar experimental results in other HNLC regions (subarctic and equatorial Pacific), growth stimulation of bacteria in the Southern Ocean resulted in significant biomass accumulation, apparently by stimulating bacterial growth in excess of removal processes. Bacterial growth was relatively unchanged by additions of iron alone; however, additions of glucose plus iron resulted in substantial increases in rates of bacterial growth and biomass accumulation. These results imply that bacterial growth efficiency and nitrogen utilization may be partly constrained by iron availability in the HNLC Southern Ocean.

The investigation distinguished three processes of SOM dissolution. They include an initial, fast process (probably hydrophilic dissolved organic matter) and two slow, rate limited processes, which probably correspond to hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (DOM). The second process indicates a slow, continuous release of DOM, whereas the third process is determined by a power law. The rate of the third process strongly depends on temperature and state of moisture. It is diffusion limited, with the diffusion control probably being located in the solid soil organic matter. This was explained by a gel structure, which slowly forms in the hydrating SOM and allows diffusion of mobile particles of SOM. The results show the importance of considering the moisture state of SOM for the kinetics of DOM dissolution.

The change from hot extraction (90 degreesC) in alkaline conditions to stabilized moderate (29-36% K reduction) oxygen delignification within 30 hours could successfully be described. Changes in elemental composition of dissolving organic matter reflected the increased yield (to 97.7 %) and specificity of lignin dissolution (to 61 %). The adaptable fraction, namely complete degradation and volatile organic compounds (CD+VOC) during oxygen delignification raised to 7,8 kg/t and the internal composition changed towards lower share of carbon (similar to carbohydrates). Thus elemental knowledge of DOM according to the system utilized contributes to evaluation of process status.																			1-896742-62-9				2000							47	54								WOS:000169736600007

The strong differences in wind regimes between the Monsoons were reflected in the distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Concentrations of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) were highest during the SW Monsoon within 100 km of the coast of Oman. In contrast, highest values during the NE Monsoon were found in offshore regions of the Arabian Sea. During the SW Monsoon, surface CDOM and FDOM correlated inversely with temperature, suggesting that upwelled water was the source of the colored and fluorescent material. Vertical profiles showed an inverse relationship between CDOM absorption and temperature, and a decrease in spectral slope with decrease in temperature, suggesting that deeper waters contain higher molecular weight CDOM than shallow waters. Profiles also showed the presence of a highly colored and fluorescent water mass centered at 250 m corresponding to Persian Gulf Water Mass. This water may be a source of colored organic material to overlying water masses. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although analysis of the response surface and the emission characteristics can be documented manually, this process is subjective in nature and prone to errors.

This semi-enclosed basin receives large riverine discharges that strongly affect its trophic dynamics. The high organic load, which results from both autochtonous and allochtonous sources, is responsible for anoxia and massive aggregate formation. The general characteristics of the microbial food web and its role in the cycling of carbon are critically evaluated. Factors affecting DOM uptake by bacteria, including DOM diagenesis and molecular size, nutrient availability, the effect of temperature and the abiotic alterations of DOM are discussed. Possible causes for DOM seasonality are suggested. A restricted bacterial uptake due to scarce inorganic phosphorus availability, along with strong allochtonous inputs of refractory compounds and strong water stratification in summer, appear to be the most important factors. Finally, the distribution of organic carbon between dissolved and colloidal components and the role of colloids in the aggregation phenomena in marine systems are briefly outlined, and hypotheses for the formation of macroaggregates in the northern Adriatic are reviewed.

J	Thoss, V; Baird, MS; Lock, MA				Thoss, V; Baird, MS; Lock, MA			The development of a chemical 'fingerprint' to characterise dissolved organic matter in natural waters	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												A suite of twelve assays has been used to 'fingerprint' dissolved organic matter (DOM). The assays were applied directly to filtered natural water samples. Temperature, pH and conductivity accounted for the environmental conditions on-site. Bulk carbon characteristics were assayed by measuring UV absorbance at 200 and 240 nm, colour in grade Hazen, DOC (dissolved organic carbon), fluorescence (excitation 370 nm, emission 450 nm) and the complexation of phenol itself. Measuring hydroxybenzenes ('monophenolics'), polyhydroxybenzenes ('polyphenolics') and total phenolics with the Gibbs, Prussian Blue and Folin-Ciocalteau assays, respectively, determined the phenolics pool. The methodology was tested on six freshwater sites in North Wales chosen to provide differences in vegetation, land-use and water chemistry and sampled once during each season. A novel approach for the presentation of the data has been developed that combines all range normalised assay results for each site and each season within one polar plot, hence the term 'fingerprint'. The data was also analysed using principal component factor analysis. Assays characterised as determining the chemical properties of DOM contributed to Factor 1 and explained 59% of the variation in the data. Assays apparently determined by the water matrix, contributed to Factor 2 and explained 20% of the variation within the data. The factor scores obtained for each site showed more variation for assays relating to the chemical properties of DOM than to the surrounding water matrix. The methodology was found to detect chemical changes within DOM for each site throughout the year and different responses for different sites.

Atomic ratios of bulk elemental analysis suggest a compositional shift from carbohydrate dominated structures to phenolic polymers. Observed variations of bulk delta(15)N and total nitrogen are likely due to microbial production. Combining isotopic and structural information using a coupled Py-GC/MS-IRMS system provides further information on the peat formation, e.g. biogeochemical processes of (1) biological degradation of source material, (2) selective preservation of individual compounds, and (3) formation of microbial biomass (e.g. trophic level effect). In particular, the stable isotope data helped to identify microbial processes as a source for carbohydrate pyrolysis products in deeper horizons. The comparison of pyrolysis products from peat and DOM from the bog lake indicates different sources. From the isotope ratios of pyrolysates it is suggested that DOM is formed in situ by microbial production and not simply dissolved from the peat profile. The uptake of C-13 depleted carbon, e.g. respired CO2, CO2 from the oxidation of methane or acetic acid is proposed as an important factor in the formation of dissolved organic matter.

UDOM samples were taken from four locations with salinities varying from 0.43 to 20 parts per thousand. The UDOM in these samples was concentrated using cross-flow ultrafiltration and represents the size fraction of DOM between 1000 Dalton and 0.2 mu m. The samples were analyzed by analytical pyrolysis, stable carbon isotope and radiocarbon analysis, and solid state C-13 NMR, All UDOM samples throughout the estuary showed relatively similar pyrolyzates and C-14 activities (c. 87%). Solid-state C-13 NMR spectra were also similar, except for the sample with the highest salinity. UDOM delta(13)C values ranged from -27.78 to -25.40 parts per thousand with increasing salinity. This suggests mixing of river DOM with seawater DOM of comparable ages. The absence of pyrolysis products of unaltered polysaccharides, lignins, proteins and lipids indicates that the Ems-Dollart estuary UDOM consists of a large fraction of refractory organic matter and a very small fraction of fresh organic matter.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was fractionated by ultrafiltration into 1-30 kDa (HDOM) and 30 kDa-0.2 mum (VHDOM) nominal molecular weight fractions. Thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was used to release and quantify lipids and lignin phenols. Stable carbon isotopes, fatty acids and lignin content indicated shifts in sources with terrigenous material in the river and turbid region and a predominantly algal/planktonic signal in the lower estuary and coastal ocean. Thermochemolysis with TMAH released significant amounts of short chain fatty acids (C(9)-C(13)), not seen by traditional alkaline hydrolysis, which appear to be associated with the macromolecular matrix. Lignin phenol distributions in HDOM, VHDOM and particles followed predicted sources with higher concentrations in the river and turbid region of the estuary and lower concentrations in the coastal ocean. TOM comprised 12% of HDOM within the coastal ocean and up to 73% of HDOM within the turbid region of the estuary. In the coastal ocean, TOM from high molecular weight DOM comprised 4% of total DOG. The annual flux of TOM from the Delaware Estuary to the coastal ocean was estimated at 2.0 x 10(10) g OC year(-1) and suggests that temperate estuaries such as Delaware Bay can be significant sources of TOM on a regional scale.

Actively excited fluorescence in UV- and visible spectral regions was used to investigate spatial distributions of DOM, Chl a, carotenoids and phycoerythrin in surface water. The fluorescent data were collected by means of laser remote sensing spectrometer (LIDAR), spectrofluorometers in underway flow-through mode and in the measurements of the water samples. Pronounced variable spatial structures of phytoplankton were observed in spring 1995 and late summer 1993, while in early summer 1994 the pigment distribution was rather homogeneous. The spatial modulation of high-resolution profiles of phytoplankton with the period 3.5-5 km was detected across the gulf in all seasons probably caused by variability of hydrophysical conditions.

J	Opsahl, S; Benner, R; Amon, RMW				Opsahl, S; Benner, R; Amon, RMW			Major flux of terrigenous dissolved organic matter through the Arctic Ocean	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												High-latitude rivers supply the Arctic Ocean with a disproportionately large share of global riverine discharge and terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). We used the abundance of lignin, a macromolecule unique to vascular plants, and stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) to trace the high molecular weight fraction of terrigenous DOM in major water masses of the Arctic Ocean. Lignin oxidation products in ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM; >1,000 Da) from Arctic rivers were depleted in syringyl relative to vanillyl phenols (S/V = 0.3-0.5) compared to UDOM in temperate and tropical rivers (S/ V = 0.5-1.2), indicating that gymnosperm vegetation is a major source of terrigenous UDOM to the Arctic Ocean. High concentrations of lignin oxidation products (83-320 ng L-1) and a depletion of C-13 (delta(13)C = -23.0 to -21.9) in UDOM throughout the surface Arctic Ocean indicate that terrigenous UDOM accounts for a much greater fraction of the UDOM in the surface Arctic (5-33%) than in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (0.7-2.4%). In contrast, UDOM in deep water from the Arctic Ocean as well as waters from throughout the Greenland Gyre had relatively low concentrations of lignin oxidation products (24-45 ng L-1) and was enriched in C-13 (delta(13)C = -21.0 to -20.8). Terrigenous UDOM has a relatively short residence (similar to 1-6 yr) in surface polar waters prior to export to the north Atlantic Ocean. Assuming that the bulk of Arcticderived DOM is compositionally similar to the UDOM fraction, we estimate that 12-41% of terrigenous DOM (2.9-10.3 Tg C yr(-1)) discharged by rivers to the Arctic Ocean is exported to the North Atlantic via surface waters of the East Greenland Current. It appears very little terrigenous DOM from the Arctic is incorporated into North Atlantic Deep Water and distributed globally via deep thermohaline circulation.

J	Fu, QS; Barkovskii, AL; Adriaens, P				Fu, QS; Barkovskii, AL; Adriaens, P			Reductive transformation of dioxins: An assessment of the contribution of dissolved organic matter to dechlorination reactions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The susceptibility of dioxins to dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-mediated dechlorination reactions was investigated using 1,2,3,4,6,7,9-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD), Aldrich humic acid (AHA), and polymaleic acid (PMA) as model compounds. The dechlorination yields were on the order of 4-20% which, when normalized to phenolic acidity, was comparable to yields observed in the presence of the humic constituents catechol and resorcinol. Based; on the ratio of dechlorination yields as a function of phenolic acidity and electron transfer capacity, differences in electron transfer efficiency to dioxins a re likely combined effects of specific interactions with the functional groups and nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Hexa-and pentaCDD homologues were dominant in all incubations, and diCDD constituted the final product of dechlorination. The rates of appearance of lesser chlorinated products (pM-nM/d) were similar to those observed in sediment systems and followed thermodynamic considerations as they decreased with a decrease in level of chlorination. Generally, both absolute and phenolic acidity-normalized rate constants for AHA-mediated reactions were up to 2-fold higher than those effected by PMA. These results indicate that the electron shuttling capacity of sediment DOC may significantly affect the fate of dioxins, in part through dechlorination reactions.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 1	1999	33	21					3837	3842		10.1021/es981342w						WOS:000083458800037		
J	Kim, SD; Ma, HZ; Allen, HE; Cha, DK				Kim, SD; Ma, HZ; Allen, HE; Cha, DK			Influence of dissolved organic matter on the toxicity of copper to Ceriodaphnia dubia: Effect of complexation kinetics	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The reaction kinetics of copper interaction with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water were studied in order to determine the effect of equilibration period on the toxicity of copper to aquatic organisms. The changes in physical and chemical forms of the copper during four reaction times were examined in four completely mixed reactors in series; the bioavailability of the copper as a function of these new forms was then determined with a flow-through bioassay system, using Ceriodaphnia dubia as a test organism. This study showed that the toxicity of copper to C. dubia decreased with increasing copper-DOM reaction time, which demonstrated that the copper reaction rate with dissolved organic components in the test water was slow. The toxicity of copper to C. dubia was closely related to the measured free-copper concentration (CU2+) rather than to the total copper concentrations, a fact that supports the free ion activity model. We found that the LC50 of copper for C. dubia increased (i.e., toxicity decreased) linearly with increasing total available binding sites. Although a similar trend was observed in both natural DOM and commercial humic acid, our results indicated that for a given copper-organic carbon ratio, copper binds more strongly to humic acid than to the natural DOM. This difference may be attributed to the greater copper binding affinity of humic acid (greater than that of other metal-binding organic fractions present in DOM, i.e., fulvic acid).																	0730-7268					NOV	1999	18	11					2433	2437								WOS:000083271100008		
J	Williams, CF; Farmer, WJ; Letey, J; Nelson, SD				Williams, CF; Farmer, WJ; Letey, J; Nelson, SD			Design and characterization of a new dialysis chamber for investigating dissolved organic matter-organic complexes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Equilibrium dialysis is commonly used to measure the complex formed between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and pesticides such as napropamide [2(alpha-naphthoxy)-N,N-diethyl propionamide]. Currently the dialysis method most often used employs dialysis tubing that is clamped on both ends. Limitations of the dialysis tubing method include difficulty in sample addition to the dialysis tubing, dilution effects, and the need for large sample volumes. A new dialysis chamber constructed of Teflon and using fiat dialysis membranes is described and characterized using napropamide as a model compound. Using a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut off of 500 Daltons the system reached equilibrium across the membrane within 120 h. Significant sorption of napropamide to the membrane was observed. Napropamide sorption was linear, reversible, and dependant on the membrane used. Sample addition and removal from the chamber is possible without destroying the integrity of the membrane. The dialysis chamber allowed for fast and easy quantitative addition and removal of sample for dialysis without wasting sample. The small chamber made possible dialysis of very small samples (as little as 1.5 mL) while maintaining a large surface area for diffusion. The chamber also provided dialysis with a maximum dilution factor of two since the volume of dialysate needed is equal to the volume of sample introduced.																	0047-2425					NOV-DEC	1999	28	6					1757	1760								WOS:000084288300010		
J	Obernosterer, I; Reitner, B; Herndl, GJ				Obernosterer, I; Reitner, B; Herndl, GJ			Contrasting effects of solar radiation on dissolved organic matter and its bioavailability to marine bacterioplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The effect of ultraviolet radiation on the bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to marine bacterioplankton was investigated in the Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, South and North Aegean Sea) and in the Caribbean Sea off Curacao. Surface-water samples (collected between 1 and 85 m in depth) exposed to solar radiation did not show a distinct pattern in subsequent bacterial growth. However, samples collected from a pronounced chlorophyll maximum (two stations in the Strait of Gibraltar and four stations in the Aegean Sea) displayed in a 50% lower bacterial activity in the radiation-exposed treatments compared with the dark controls. In contrast, mesopelagic water samples (200-350 m in depth) exposed to surface solar radiation exhibited a two- to fourfold increase in bacterial activity compared with the corresponding dark controls. Addition of the model protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) to mesopelagic-water samples and subsequent exposure to solar radiation resulted in a 50% lower rate of bacterial activity compared with the dark treatments, thus indicating the occurrence of photochemically induced changes to this labile compound. This decrease in bacterial activity in BSA-amended, irradiated water was also detectable in surface waters sampled off Curacao, whereas BSA amendment to surface water from the Mediterranean Sea did not result in a distinct pattern of bacterial activity. Our data indicate that exposure of DOM to solar radiation causes a reduced bioavailability of the exposed DOM to bacterioplankton, if the bacterial activity:dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration ratio is high (indicative of labile DOM). If the bacterial activity:DOC ratio is low (indicative of more refractory DOM), the bioavailability of the DOM is increased upon exposure to solar radiation.

J	Marhaba, TF; Van, D				Marhaba, TF; Van, D			Chlorinated disinfection by-product formation potential of dissolved organic matter fractions at an ozonation water treatment plant	ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the intake and throughout an ozonation surface water treatment plant in central New Jersey was isolated and fractionated by resin adsorption. The water treatment process involves conventional treatment with pre- and intermediate ozonation, multi-media granular activated carbon filtration, and post chlorination. DOM isolation and fractionation into six fractions (hydrophobic acid, neutral and base, and hydrophilic acid, neutral, and base) by chromatographic resin columns was performed. Each fraction was subjected to a 7-day chlorine disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential test. The results show that the fractions have different reactivity levels in the formation of the three classes of DBPs. For this source water, hydrophobic material dominates over the hydrophilic material in producing trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs) and haloacetonitriles (HANs). Depending on the type of DBPs under consideration, the unbundling of DBP precursors enables one to identify the fraction precursor that is most responsible for the formation of that particular DBP. DBP control strategy can thereby be optimized. The effect of the water treatment unit processes on the DBP formation potential of each organic fraction is also discussed.																	1093-0191					FAL	1999	3	3					255	268								WOS:000083561500003

Complexation of DOM with pesticides ran lead to increased aqueous phase concentration and therefore enhanced movement through the soil profile, Dissolved organic matter has been shown to form a stable complex with napropamide [2(alpha-naphthoxy)-N,N-diethyl propionamide] and facilitate its transport through soil columns. Equilibrium dialysis is a common method to determine napropamide DOM complexation. Napropamide was applied to a silt loam soil with (SS) and without (NoSS) sewage sludge application. Solutions from batch equilibrium experiments were analyzed using equilibrium dialysis with various molecular weight cutoffs to determine napropamide DOM complexation. A maximum of 16% of solution phase napropamide was found to be associated with a DOM complex having a molecular weight >500 Daltons. The maximum complex size had a molecular weight <25 000 Daltons, More napropamide was complexed from the SS soil treatments than from the NoSS soil treatments. The presence of a drying event following napropamide application also was found to increase the amount of napropamide complexed in both the SS and NoSS soils. Results show that the amount and molecular weight of napropamide-DOM complexes is affected by organic matter type and application method.																	0047-2425					SEP-OCT	1999	28	5					1429	1435								WOS:000082553500006		
J	Taylor, E; Cook, BB; Tarr, MA				Taylor, E; Cook, BB; Tarr, MA			Dissolved organic matter inhibition of sonochemical degradation of aqueous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons	ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY												Sonochemical degradation of aqueous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was found to be rapid in the absence of other dissolved compounds (k = 0.006-0.015 s(-1)). In the presence of 20 mg C l(-1) fulvic acid, first-order PAH degradation rate constants decreased from 2.3- to 3.7-fold. Similar results were obtained with added benzoic acid, a crude analog for fulvic acid. In natural waters, PAH degradation was almost completely inhibited. Analysis of the kinetic behavior and reaction products indicates that PAHs are most likely degraded through a radical cation mechanism. Hydroxyl radical appeared to play an insignificant role in the degradation. Inhibited degradation was probably the result of either altered cavitation processes or isolation of the PAH away from cavitation sites. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Water clarity ranged widely, with the diffuse vertical attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation (K(dI)PAR) varying from 0.26 to 17.2 m(-1), and UVR attenuation varied positively and significantly with K(dI)PAR. Particle concentration (total suspended solids, TSS) was the single most useful water quality characteristic for predicting broadband UVB (305-320 nm) and UVA (320-400 nm) attenuation.. Dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) and fluorescence were much less important than TSS in predicting UVR attenuation over the typical range of water clarity (K(dI)PAR < 2 m(-1)). The predominant role of TSS in UVR attenuation could not be explained by phytoplankton or other absorbing organic matter in the particulate phase, suggesting instead an important role for scattering. Attenuation spectra through the UV region were not monotonic at the higher particle concentrations and could not be modelled solely as a function of DOC as previously reported for other lakes. Attenuation at 310 and 320 nm confirmed the conclusion from spectrally integrated measurements that particles are the dominant agents of variable UVR attenuation in Lake Erie.																	0706-652X					AUG	1999	56	8					1351	1361		10.1139/cjfas-56-8-1351						WOS:000082326800003

Nonlinear regressions of bound versus free Cu concentrations were consistent with a two-ligand model for DOM complexation of Cu, in which the conditional stability constants (log K) and complexation capacities (CC) were log K-1 = 7.26, CC1 = 0.21 mu mol Cu.mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC)(-1) and log K-2 = 5.13, CC2 = 2.89 mu mol Cu.mg DOC-1. Copper-binding constants were similar in filtered (0.45 mu m) and unfiltered water samples. Calcium, Mg, and Co did not compete appreciably with Cu for DOM complexation at concentrations present in site waters. Copper binding to amorphous iron oxide flocs also was not important at the Fe concentrations present in the stream waters. We selected a mixture of three organic acids, dipicolinic, oxalic, and malonic, to mimic the Cu-binding properties of this DONI. Geochemical models were developed to estimate Cu speciation and evaluate its bioavailability in companion fish toxicity tests using the DOM analogue (Marr et al. 1999. Can. J. Fish. Aquat.

It is based on previously published humic acid and soil organic matter (SOM) models. Personal computer (PC)-based molecular modeling and geometry optimization of DOM and humic/xenobiotic complexes in vacuo and water were performed using modern PC software in order to determine low energy conformations and to simulate site-specific processes such as trapping and binding of biological and anthropogenic substances. Nanochemistry (10(-9) m level) allows the evaluation of atomic and molecular space requirements, voids, inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and interactions with water, metal cations, and xenobiotics. The described modeling approach in general allows hydrophilic and hydrophobic reactions to be examined. Structural, molecular, and environmental properties of DOM and its xenobiotic complexes were determined by quantitative structure-activity relationship software. Focal points were molecular properties, such as solvent accessibility as well as van der Waals surface areas and volumes, partial charges, hydration energy (peptides), hydrophobicity (log P), refractivity, and polarizabilities of humic/xenobiotic complexes were determined. Molecular mechanics calculations show that nonbonded forces (e.g., van der Waals) and hydrogen bonds were the main reasons for temporary immobility of xenobiotic substances retained in DOM. Preliminary experiments to simulate the acidity of water molecules by protonation-enhanced reactions with polar xenobiotics (e.g., hydroxyatrazine) but left nonpolar substances (e.g., DDT) unchanged.																	0730-7268					AUG	1999	18	8					1643	1655		10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<1643:IODOMW>2.3.CO;2						WOS:000081709900006		
J	Mannino, A; Harvey, HR				Mannino, A; Harvey, HR			Lipid composition in particulate and dissolved organic matter in the Delaware Estuary: Sources and diagenetic patterns	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated from surface waters of Delaware Bay along a transect from freshwater to the coastal ocean and fractionated by tangential flow ultrafiltration into high (1-30 kDa; HDOM) and very high (30 kDa-0.2 mu m; VHDOM) nominal molecular mass fractions. Carbon content, stable carbon isotopes, and lipid composition were measured for each DOM fraction, and particles collected in parallel. Lipids, excluding hydrocarbons, comprised up to 0.33% of HDOM organic carbon, 1.6% of VHDOM carbon, and 10% of POC, the majority of which were fatty acids. Although lipids comprised a small fraction of HDOM, fatty acids and sterols provided valuable information on the origins of DOM. Molecular composition of particulate and dissolved lipids and bulk stable carbon isotopes demonstrated differences in organic sources along the estuarine gradient with distinct terrestrial signals in the river and turbid middle estuary and an algal signal in the lower estuary and coastal ocean. Both particulate organic matter and VHDOM samples were enriched in lipids on a carbon basis compared to the HDOM fraction, which suggests that the HDOM fraction was less labile than particulate organic matter or VHDOM. Selective degradation of labile lipids by the microbial community can account for the depletions of unsaturated fatty acids, sterols, and phytol within HDOM relative to particles.

A non-manipulated catchment served as a reference. After 4 yr of treatment no significant effects of either manipulation were found on concentrations and characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The variability of these parameters within catchments appeared to be of the same order of magnitude as the variability between catchments. At all sites, DON contributed more than 70% of the total dissolved nitrogen. In general, the proportion of hydrophilic DOC increased with depth. In contrast, to other studies the C/N ratio of DOM at Gardsjon did not show a clear pattern with depth. Other studies in SE U.S.A. have suggested that relatively low C/N ratios at depth are due to increased contribution of hydrophilic neutrals to DOC. However, this fraction appears to be small in temperate and boreal spruce forest soils, including Gardsjon.																	0049-6979					AUG	1999	114	1-2					199	219								WOS:000081420000013		
J	Schulten, HR; Gleixner, G				Schulten, HR; Gleixner, G			Analytical pyrolysis of humic substances and dissolved organic matter in aquatic systems: structure and origin	WATER RESEARCH												Samples of freeze-dried surface-lake brownwater (HO original), derived fulvic (FA) and humic acids (HA) and ultrafiltrate (K) which represent reference materials of a priority program of the German Research Council on "Refractory Organic Substances in Waters" were investigated using py rolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS), Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and, for the first time, Curie-pyrolysis-gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Py-GC-C-IRMS). Py-FIMS of dissolved organic matter (DOM), FA, and HA gave highly reliable fingerprint mass spectra, thermograms describing the thermal properties and qualitative and quantitative data of 10 classes of characteristic molecular building blocks. Carbohydrates, phenols and lignin monomers; lignin dimers, lipids, alkylaromatics, aromatic nitrogen compounds, sterols, peptides, suberins and loosely bound fatty acids were determined. Complementary molecular structure information was obtained by Py-GC/MS which allowed the identification of a wide range of humic building blocks as main pyrolysis products. Our first results using the novel method of combined Py-GC/MS and Py-GC-C-IRMS indicate that the delta(13)C-values of the pyrolysis products are in agreement with generally accepted data for carbohydrates, lignin and benzenes from biological sources. This implies that the pyrolytical step does not have an isotopic effect. In contrast, some of the thermal products, e.g. 5-methyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde and benzenemethyl, had stronger depletions in C-13 in comparison to the mean delta(13)C-values of furans and benzenes, respectively. This result contradicts the enrichment of C-13 due to trophic effects and therefore suggests the incorporation of light carbon sources, such as respiratory CO2, methane, or anthropogenic pollution by fossil fuels, in the humification processes.

The regulation of this activity occurs at two different levels: on the one hand, at the cellular level, the ectoenzyme synthesis is regulated by hydrolysis substrates, dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA), and end products, dissolved free amino acids (DFAA), in terms of the relative amounts available to the cell, and on the other hand, at the ecosystem level, i.e. the hydrolytic activity, by the total amounts of DCAA and DFAA in situ. The DFAA acts as an inhibitor in enzymatic synthesis; in contrast, dissolved proteins induce the enzymatic synthesis and the exoproteolytic activitiy. These results, obtained in natural concentration conditions, confirm the functioning in situ of the ectoenzymatic activity regulation model of Chrost, until now only validated in an enriched experimental medium.

J	Rothschild, BJ; Haley, PJ; Cai, D				Rothschild, BJ; Haley, PJ; Cai, D			Influence of physical forcing on microclouds of dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the ocean	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A theory is developed on the statistical field description of plankton microzones or micropatches. The theory, which is based upon stochastic geometry, predicts length scales and volume-fraction measures associated with plankton dynamics. The theory is exemplified by considering how microclouds might modulate the transformation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into heterotrophic biomass. Volume fraction, covariance functions and spherical contact distributions for assemblages of Baltic Sea phytoplankton were computed using real data on phytoplankton cell density and size with conjectured microzone dimensions. By comparing microcloud length scales with molecular diffusion, turbulent diffusion and uncorrelated velocity length scales, we determined that variability in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate, which might be induced by global and basin-scale wind forcing (for example), could influence the structure and functioning of the carbon microclouds. Microclouds, in contrast to microzones, are subject to the straining effects of turbulent diffusion, in addition to molecular diffusion. The microclouds themselves are often too small to be subject to uncorrelated velocities. However, the relative motion among microclouds is driven by the uncorrelated velocities of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The concentrations of DOC suggest that the microclouds are temporary loci that enhance interaction among phytoplankton cells, bacteria and microzooplankton.																	0142-7873					JUL	1999	21	7					1217	1230		10.1093/plankt/21.7.1217						WOS:000081789500002		
J	Everett, CR; Chin, YP; Aiken, GR				Everett, CR; Chin, YP; Aiken, GR			High-pressure size exclusion chromatography analysis of dissolved organic matter isolated by tangential-flow ultrafiltration	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A 1,000-Dalton tangential-how ultrafiltration (TFUF) membrane was used to isolate dissolved organic matter (DOM) from several freshwater environments. The TFUF unit used in this study was able to completely retain a polystyrene sulfonate 1,800-Dalton standard. Unaltered and TFUF-fractionated DOM molecular weights were assayed by high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The weight-averaged molecular weights of the retentates were larger than those of the raw water samples, whereas the filtrates were all significantly smaller and approximately the same size or smaller than the manufacturer-specified pore size of the membrane. Moreover, at 280 nm the molar absorptivity of the DOM retained by the ultrafilter is significantly larger than the material in the filtrate. This observation suggests that most of the chromophoric components are associated with the higher molecular weight fraction of the DOM pool. Multivalent metals in the aqueous matrix also affected the molecular weights of the DOM molecules. Typically, proton-exchanged DOM retentates were smaller than untreated samples. This TFUF system appears to be an effective means of isolating aquatic DOM by size, but the ultimate size of the retentates may be affected by the presence of metals and by configurational properties unique to the DOM phase.																	0024-3590					JUL	1999	44	5					1316	1322								WOS:000081639000012

In addition, the binding ability (maximum complexing capacity - MCC) of the DOM was compared with that of humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) acids from a clay-loam soil. The study was performed using Cu-2+ ions since this metal is widely used as a supplement in pig diets and, consequently, is present in pig slurry. The techniques adopted were gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and dialysis. GFC showed that the DOM from pig slurry is mainly composed of a fraction with an apparent molecular weight higher than 5000 Da and the copper naturally present in the slurry is completely complexed by this fraction. The dialysis procedure enabled MCC to be determined. The MCC of pig slurry DOM and soil HA, which contained a similar concentration of carboxylic groups, were analogous, while MCC of soil FA, which contained double the concentration of carboxylic groups, was higher.

The organic acids dissolved in throughfall have a Similar acidic site density but are weaker than those dissolved in soil solution, stream and lake waters. This method is useful to determine the contribution of organic anions to the charge balance and to the buffering capacity of dissolved organic rich waters with low acid neutralizing capacity. It can be used also to determine the respective contribution of natural organics and anthropogenic minerals to the total acidity of throughfall and rain waters.

J	Baldwin, DS				Baldwin, DS			Dissolved organic matter and phosphorus leached from fresh and 'terrestrially' aged river red gum leaves: implications for assessing river-floodplain interactions	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The rates of leaching, speciation and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dissolved phosphorus (P) leached from fresh leaves of the river redgum, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh, were compared to those from leaves which had been aged on the flood plain for 5 months. The DOM and P leaching rates from microbially inhibited aged leaves were first-order with respect to leaf quantity. The kinetics of DOM and P leaching from fresh leaves were more complex; DOM leaching from fresh leaves appeared to be self-inhibitory, while P leaching from leaves was potentially enzymatically mediated. 2. The speciation and microbial bioavailability of DOM from fresh and aged leaves were completely different. At lower leaf biomass, almost all the DOM from fresh leaves was utilized by an introduced microbial consortium; at higher biomass, microbial utilization appeared to be nutrient limited. Conversely, only about 30% of the DOM leached from aged leaves was utilized by the introduced microbial consortium during the course of the experiment. The difference in microbial utilization could be a result of changes in DOM speciation as a consequence of terrestrial ageing. 3. Weak-anion exchange chromatograms of microbially inhibited fresh leaf extracts showed numerous (unassigned) DOM peaks, most of which could be used by the microbial consortium present. The weak-anion exchange chromatograms of sterile aged leaves showed only three broad peaks and a number of smaller spikes. Only one of the broad peaks could be utilized by the microbial consortium. 4. Phosphorus speciation was also determined by weak-anion exchange chromatography. Most of the P leached from both fresh and aged leaves was free orthophosphate, and therefore, readily available. Two organic-P species leached from microbially inhibited fresh leaves were also found to be readily available to the microbiota.

J	D'Sa, EJ; Steward, RG; Vodacek, A; Blough, NV; Phinney, D				D'Sa, EJ; Steward, RG; Vodacek, A; Blough, NV; Phinney, D			Determining optical absorption of colored dissolved organic matter in seawater with a liquid capillary waveguide	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Optical absorption spectra of 0.2-mu m filtered seawater samples originating from diverse oceanic and coastal waters were measured with a long pathlength capillary waveguide; results were compared with those of three different laboratory spectrophotometers. The 0.5-m-long 550-mu m (inside diameter) aqueous waveguide uses only 120 mu l of filtered seawater. making it convenient for use in flow-through cells or when sample volumes are restricted. Source light propagates inside the capillary waveguide by total internal reflection because of the lower refractive index of the waveguide walls with respect to the aqueous core. The absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) at 355 nm and S, the slope of the log-linearized CDOM absorption spectra, were determined for all samples. The CDOM absorption spectra measured by the capillary waveguide closely matched that measured by spectrophotometers for CDOM concentrations varying over an order of magnitude. The deviations between the absorption spectra obtained with the capillary waveguide and those obtained with the standard spectrophotometers increased with decreasing total absorption and with increase in wavelength, presumably because of the greater baseline offsets observed in the capillary waveguide. The offsets are due to differences in refractive indices between the seawater samples and the freshwater reference. With a suitable reference, the capillary waveguide will be very useful for monitoring surface seawater CDOM absorption semicontinuously.

J	Nambu, K; Yonebayashi, K				Nambu, K; Yonebayashi, K			Role of dissolved organic matter in translocation of nutrient cations from organic layer materials in coniferous and broad leaf forests	SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) transports many kinds of substances in soil. In order to investigate the contribution of DOM to the transport of nutrient cations from forest organic layers to mineral soils, incubation experiments were conducted on organic layer materials of two Quercus species (broad leaves), Japanese cypress and Japanese cedar. Water leachates from the incubated organic layer materials contained far smaller amounts of mineral anions than cations. The deficit of negative charges was related to the organic anions of DOM. In the course of the decomposition, exchange sites formed on the surface of the plant residues retained some of the cations, which were prone to elution by organic anions of DONI. Potassium was least retained; 33 to 62% of the initial contents were leached with water during the 5-week incubation period. The divalent cations, Mg and Ca, were not substantially leached. Still at most 81 and 45%, for Mg and Ca, respectively, of the initial amounts were transformed into an ammonium acetate-extractable form, due to the elution by organic anions of DOM on a longer time scale. The amount of DOM controlled the total amount of eluted cations. The extent of cation mobilization differed among the four plant species, and decreased in the order of broad leaf species > cypress > cedar. A similar tendency was also observed in the distribution patterns of the cations between the organic layers and the mineral soils in fields. The production of DOM increased at higher (up to 30 degrees C) temperature, while the increase in CO2 emissions was larger. The production of DOM and CO2 showed a linear relation for the Oe layer materials, while no correlation was detected for the Oi ones, presumably because water-soluble saccharides, the major substrates used in the Oi layer, did not produce efficiently DOM. The production of DOM and CO2 was larger in the broad leaf litter than in the coniferous one. The emission of CO2 was negatively correlated with the C/P and lignin/P ratio, while the production of DOM was positively correlated with the contents of hot water-soluble N and hemicellulose. The largest correlation coefficient was detected between CO2 and DOM production.																	0038-0768					JUN	1999	45	2					307	319								WOS:000080807100006		
J	Pedersen, JA; Gabelich, CJ; Lin, CH; Suffet, IH				Pedersen, JA; Gabelich, CJ; Lin, CH; Suffet, IH			Aeration effects on the partitioning of a PCB to anoxic estuarine sediment pore water dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Pore water dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the distribution, mobility, and bioavailability of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) in sediment environments. The effect of aeration on the partitioning of 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TeCB) to anoxic pore water DOM from three estuarine sites was investigated. Pore water DOM was fractionated into molecular size and polarity fractions by ultrafiltration and XAD-8 resin chromatography. Total organic carbon analysis was utilized to determine shifts in molecular size and polarity distributions. Changes in functional groups and aromaticity were evaluated for whole and fractionated pore waters by specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) The solubility enhancement method was used to determine the partitioning of TeCB to whole and fractionated pore water DOM. At two sites, the overall TeCB-DOM distribution coefficient decreased by an order of magnitude after aeration. The higher molecular size and all polarity fractions exhibited a decrease in partitioning behavior upon aeration. The aromaticity and TeCB-DOM distribution coefficient of the lowest molecular size fraction (<1000 Da) decreased upon aeration. The highest (>10 000 Da) and lowest (<1000) molecular size fractions contributed the most to overall partitioning. The observed aeration effects in anoxic estuarine sediment pore waters differed significantly from those previously reported in freshwater systems.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 1	1999	33	9					1388	1397		10.1021/es980717a						WOS:000080107000026

At low Hg concentrations (less than or equal to 5 x 10(-8) M), DOM prevented the precipitation of metacinnabar. At moderate Hg concentrations (5 x 10(-5) M), DOM inhibited the aggregation of colloidal metacinnabar (Hg passed through a 0.1 mu m filter but was removed by centrifugation). At Hg concentrations greater than 5 x 10(-4) M, mercury formed solid metacinnabar particles that were removed from solution by a 0.1 mu m filter. Organic matter rich in aromatic moieties was preferentially removed with the solid. Hydrophobic organic acids (humic and fulvic acids) inhibited aggregation better than hydrophilic organic acids. The presence of chloride, acetate, salicylate, EDTA, and cysteine did not inhibit the precipitation or aggregation of metacinnabar. Calcium enhanced metacinnabar aggregation even in the presence of DOM, but the magnitude of the effect was dependent on the concentrations of DOM, Hg, and Ca. Inhibition of metacinnabar precipitation appears to be a result of strong DOM-Hg binding. Prevention of aggregation of colloidal particles appears to be caused by adsorption of DOM and electrostatic repulsion.

J	Han, N; Thompson, ML				Han, N; Thompson, ML			Copper-binding ability of dissolved organic matter derived from anaerobically digested biosolids	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The fate of metals in soils where soluble organic compounds are present may be strongly influenced by the degree to which they are complexed by organic ligands. We undertook this study to determine the combined effect of molecular weight (MW) and hydrophobicity on the Cu-binding ability of dissolved organic compounds in biosolids (i.e., sewage sludge). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from anaerobically digested sewage biosolids was fractionated by using a combination of MW fractionation and XAD-8 resin chromatography (to separate the dissolved organic compounds according to hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics). The Cu-binding abilities of the DOM fractions were obtained by using a Cu2+-ion-selective electrode (Cu-ISE) technique. The Cu-binding ability of fractionated DOM decreased significantly with increasing molecular weight, indicating that low-MW DOM had more metal-binding sites than high-MW DOM. Within each MW fraction, the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic components also exhibited differences in Cu-binding ability. For the DOM with MW 500-3500 Da, the hydrophilic fraction showed a greater Cu-binding capacity than did the hydrophobic fraction, whereas the hydrophobic acid components were most important in binding Cu for DOM with MW > 3500 Da. The maximum Cu-binding capacities of different biosolids-derived DOM fractions, estimated by employing a Langmuir model, ranged from 1.85 to 14.3 mmol Cu mol(-1) dissolved organic C (DOC), which is the same order of magnitude as similar measurements of DOM from other sources.																	0047-2425					MAY-JUN	1999	28	3					939	944								WOS:000080295600026		
J	West, LJA; Greenberg, BM; Smith, REH				West, LJA; Greenberg, BM; Smith, REH			Ultraviolet radiation effects on a microscopic green alga and the protective effects of natural dissolved organic matter	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												The population and photosynthetic responses of a microscopic green alga (Selenastrum capricornutum) to realistic levels of UV radiation (UVA and UVB) were assessed in natural lake waters of different dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Specific growth rates and photosynthetic competence (as reflected by F-v/F-m [measure of maximal quantum efficiency of photosystem IT] and t(1/2) [estimate of electrons transported to the plastoquinone pool] measured by in vivo variable chlorophyll a fluorescence) were compared between two exposure levels of UVR and two concentrations of DOC (2.5 mg C L-1, 7.7 mg C L-1). Exposure periods of 6-9 days (five to nine generations) were used. Exposure to UVA primarily affected the efficiency of photosystem IT, as evidenced by significant decreases of F-v/F-m but not growth rates or t(1/2) Exposure to UVB, in the presence of UVA, did not cause significant additional decreases of F-v/F-m but did diminish growth rates. In the low DOC water, t(1/2) was also diminished, suggesting different proximate sites of action from those for UVA, The high DOC water decreased the effective exposure to both UVA and UVB and diminished the negative impact of UV radiation on the cells, but the apparent protection was not explicable solely by the shading action of the DOG. Control values for F-v/F-m, growth rates and t(1/2) were all lower in the high DOC water, suggesting a negative side effect to the apparent protective action of the DOC against UVB.																	0031-8655					MAY	1999	69	5					536	544		10.1111/j.1751-1097.1999.tb03324.x						WOS:000080359200004		
J	Weiss, M; Simon, M				Weiss, M; Simon, M			Consumption of labile dissolved organic matter by limnetic bacterioplankton: the relative significance of amino acids and carbohydrates	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We studied the seasonal dynamics and consumption by planktonic bacteria of the labile pools of dissolved organic carbon (DOClab), dissolved amino acids (TDAA(lab)), and dissolved carbohydrates (TDCHOlab) in Lake Constance, Germany, between March and October 1994. The labile pools were defined as those fractions consumed by bacteria in 1 mu m filtered samples over 4 d. DOClab varied from 0.064 to 0.606 mg C l(-1) and constituted 5 to 36 % of bulk DOC, which ranged between 1.45 and 2.3 mg C l(-1). Proportion of DOClab >13 % occurred during the phytoplankton spring bloom, whereas later in the year <13 % of bulk DOC was labile. The bacterial growth efficiency, i.e, the ratio of biomass produced over DOC consumed, ranged from 8 to 57 % with a mean of 23 % and no obvious seasonal trend. TDAA(lab) constituted 10 to 73 % of bulk TDAA and 5 to 95 % of DOClab, respectively, with highest proportions during the spring bloom, the clear-water phase (not of DOClab), and a phytoplankton bloom in July. TDCHOlab constituted 24 to 73 % of bulk TDCHO and 5 to 86 % of DOClab, respectively, with highest proportions during the clear-water phase and in September. TDAA(lab) and TDCHOlab were positively correlated to bulk TDAA and bulk TDCHO, respectively. Even though both substrate classes were the major components of the labile DOC and together constituted 47 to 100 % of DOClab in 75 % of the experiments, they were not utilized to equal amounts but relative proportions varied considerably from May to September. Both substrates often were also utilized differently for biosynthetic and energy requirements as demonstrated by respiration measurements of C-14-amino acids and C-14-glucose. During the spring bloom amino acids were respired preferentially, whereas during the summer bloom glucose was respired preferentially. Turnover times of amino acids and glucose also demonstrated that both substrate classes were utilized differently because turnover times of glucose were consistently longer than those of amino acids except in surface waters from mid-July until September.																	0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 30	1999	17	1					1	12		10.3354/ame017001						WOS:000080660500001

The considered species should be similar in structure and properties to those responsible for analytical problems encountered in the determination of selenium in aqueous environmental samples. The approach is the same adopted for studying the complexing capacity of water samples towards heavy metals. Particularly, some polysaccharides of different structure and molecular weight have been considered and for each species, the interaction constant has been evaluated. These constants are of the same order of magnitude of those determined for real samples for "unknown" species, indicating the reliability of the adopted approach. Finally, the interaction constants seem related to the molecular weight of the considered polysaccharides. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Haitzer, M; Hoss, S; Traunspurger, W; Steinberg, C				Haitzer, M; Hoss, S; Traunspurger, W; Steinberg, C			Relationship between concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the effect of DOM on the bioconcentration of benzo[a]pyrene	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from five different origins decreased the bioconcentration of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The decrease became more pronounced with increasing concentrations of DOM, but the effect per mg l(-1) DOC was largest at low levels of DOM, indicating the lack of a simple direct relationship between DOM concentration and the bioconcentration factor (BCF). We tested the hypothesis that the quantitative relationship between DOM concentration and BCF can be described by a theoretically derived equation based on the assumption that only freely dissolved contaminants ape bioavailable (BCF = control BCF x 1/(1 + partition coefficient x DOM concentration)). This equation was used in non-linear regression procedures to fit curves to the experimental data. The resulting regression curves for data from this study (correlation coefficients (r(2)) ranging from 0.80 to 0.94), and for data from the literature (r(2) ranging from 0.62 to 1.00), showed that the model equation was able to correctly describe the relationship between DOM concentration and BCF. The slope of each curve resulted from the 'biologically determined' partition coefficient (K-DOC) that had been estimated by the regression procedure. Thus, the data set for each DOM source was reduced to a single K-DOC value (range: 20 +/- 4 x 10(4) to 49 +/- 6 x 10(4) l kg(-1) DOC (mean +/- S.E.), which allowed to compare different types of DOM, regarding their ability to reduce the bioconcentration of BaP. A comparison of 6,,, values showed that there were clear differences between the effects of DOM from different sources. In summary, we conclude that distinct effects of DOM on the bioconcentration of contaminants can occur at environmentally representative concentrations of DOM, but only for combinations of very hydrophobic contaminants (e.g. BaP) and DOM with a high binding capacity.

J	Kieber, RJ; Li, A; Seaton, PJ				Kieber, RJ; Li, A; Seaton, PJ			Production of nitrite from the photodegradation of dissolved organic matter in natural waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Significant concentrations of nitrite NO2- were produced from the photodegradation of humic substances (HS) isolated from a variety of natural waters in coastal North Carolina. Nitrite concentrations were 40-118% higher after light exposure relative to initial levels, while no statistical differences were observed in dark controls before and after irradiation. The amount of nitrite produced upon irradiation was positively correlated to the concentration of HS added (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) and to the length of irradiation. The average production rate, normalized to both humic substance concentration and time of light exposure, for all HS studied ranged from 9.7 to 17 [nM (W-h)(-1) m(-2) mg(-1)] x 10(5). This translates into an average yearly nitrite production of 2 x 10(6) mol yr(-1) in the top one meter of Onslow Bay. When natural waters were irradiated, changes in nitrite were influenced by both initial nitrite and humic substance concentrations. The rate of nitrite photochemical formation in typical coastal waters (4 nM h(-1)) was smaller than its direct photolysis rate (23 nM h(-1)) and smaller than reported rates of ammonium generation via DOM photodegradation (50 nM h(-1)) and of the same order of magnitude as NH4+ incorporation during humification (1 nM h(-1)). The photochemical release of biologically available nitrite from biologically refractory humic substances has significant implications with respect to nitrite biogeochemistry and N cycling in natural waters and suggests HS bound N is more biogeochemically labile than previously thought.																	0013-936X					APR 1	1999	33	7					993	998		10.1021/es980188a						WOS:000079543100020

Rate constants are measured for the pesticide in aqueous solution and in the presence of various samples of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Kinetic experiments are monitored with HPLC, while reaction products are determined using HPLC, GC-MS, and H-1 NMR: mechanisms are proposed far the first three steps of the reaction. It was found that the photodecomposition proceeds via first-order reaction kinetics and that the presence of various DOM samples inhibits the photolysis reaction of carbofuran. This phenomenon can be correlated to the magnitude of the. binding interaction between carbofuran and DOM. Finally, techniques such as GC-MS and H-1 NMR are used to identify the photodecomposition products. The first three steps of the reaction are defined. In the first step of the reaction, the carbamate group is cleaved from the molecule. The furan moiety is opened in the second step producing a substituted catechol with a tert-butyl alcohol group as the substituent at the number three carbon. This molecule then undergoes a dehydration reaction to form an alkene side group from the tert-butyl alcohol side group.																	0013-936X					MAR 15	1999	33	6					874	881		10.1021/es9802652						WOS:000079117100008		
J	Reche, I; Pace, ML; Cole, JJ				Reche, I; Pace, ML; Cole, JJ			Relationship of trophic and chemical conditions to photobleaching of dissolved organic matter in lake ecosystems	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a major light-absorbing substance, responsible for much of the color in water bodies. When sunlight energy is absorbed by DOM, some color can be lost by the process of photobleaching. We measured rates of DOM photobleaching in thirty lakes that varied greatly in color, trophic status and ionic composition. Loss of color (measured as absorbance at 440 nm and expressed as absorption coefficients) was a first order function of sunlight dose, and rates were nearly identical for 0.2 mu m- and GF/F-filtered samples suggesting that the process was predominantly abiotic. Photobleaching rates were rapid (color loss of 1-19% d(-1)) and varied about seven-fold among lakes. Our method underestimated the actual rate by 15-20% based on comparisons between the glass bottles we used in the survey and quartz containers. The large variation in photobleaching rates was examined in relation to lake trophy and chemical conditions. The best predictor of this variability was acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) (r(2) = 0.94; p < 0.001) such that photobleaching was most rapid in the most alkaline lakes. The relationship between ANC and photobleaching suggests that differences in ionic conditions among lakes may influence the solubility and configuration of humic and fulvic acids and hence their susceptibility to photobleaching.

The protection afforded by low natural DOC was the same as that afforded by similar or higher concentrations of commercial DOG. Trout exposed to the metals alone experienced large decreases in arterial Pot, increases in arterial P-CO2, increases in blood lactate, decreases in plasma concentrations of Cl, and developed pronounced haemoconcentration. There were no deleterious effects of 31 mg C/L commercial DOC on any measured aspect of trout physiology except for an increase in plasma Cl, which was probably due to elevated aqueous Cl concentrations associated with the DOM addition. No concentration of DOC used in the present study prevented Cd from being bound by trout gills, and some of these fish showed hypocalcemia; however, Cu was kept off the gills of trout exposed to metals plus DOM. Computer modelling using metal-gill binding constants simulated well the accumulation of Cd and the lack of Cu accumulation by trout gills in the presence of DOM.																	0706-652X					MAR	1999	56	3					407	418		10.1139/cjfas-56-3-407						WOS:000081027800007

This information is critical to understanding the fate and transport of contaminants in subsurface. Results obtained from this study indicate that DOM sorption on soil is largely due to ligand exchange between DOM and hydroxyl groups on the soil mineral surface. Soil organic matter tended to impend the sorption of DOM, presumably due to blocking of active sites on the mineral surface. The soil sorption capacity of DOM appears to be positively correlated to the soil clay content as well as the soil water solution ionic strength and pH.																	0045-6535					MAR	1999	38	7					1505	1515		10.1016/S0045-6535(98)00371-3						WOS:000078557500004

We studied the effect of natural aquatic DOM that had been in contact with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) for 1 to 12 d on the bioconcentration of B[a]P in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Dissolved organic matter quality and quantity was varied by using DOM from three different sources, each in three different concentrations. A model, based on the assumption that only freely dissolved B[a]P is bioavailable, was employed to estimate "biologically determined" partition coefficients [K-p(biol.)]. Expressing the data for each combination of DOM source and contact time in a single K-p (biol.) value allowed a direct comparison of the effects of different DOM qualities and contact times. Our results show that the effect of DOM from a specific source was dependent on DOM quantity, but we also observed a distinct effect of DOM quality (represented by different sampling locations) on the bioconcentration of B[a]P. Contact time had no significant influence for the effects of two DOM sources on the bioconcentration of B[a]P. However, the third DOM source was significantly more effective with increased contact time, leading to lower B[a]P bioconcentration in the nematodes.

Average values from both frontal regions were 151 +/- 40 mu M DOG; 30 +/- 18 mu M TDCHO-C: 1.40 +/- 0.56 mu M DFAA-C in June compared to 82 +/- 18 mu M DOG; 13 +/- 8 mu M TDCHO-C; 0.86 +/- 0.30 mu M DFAA-C in February. The accumulation of dissolved organic matter in summer presumably involves an enrichment in biorefractory compounds discharged by riverine inputs or produced by abiotic transformations and an inability of bacteria to consume all of the DOC produced. Increases in biological productivity and freshwater residence time and the onset of strong water stratification which occur in summer also favour this accumulation. The average contribution of TDCHO to DOC ranged from 20% in June to 15% in February, while that given by DFAA was about 1% in both seasons. The estimated contributions to DOC by both these classes of compounds rank in the high range of values reported for marine environments. Results on DOC molecular weight distribution showed that the largest fraction of the overall DOC pool was colloidal (similar to 60%), with truly dissolved compounds being a minor contribution. The observed accumulation of dissolved organic matter in summer along with an increased role of carbohydrates and colloidal matter may be critical factors for the formation of mucilaginous aggregates in this basin.

J	Nambu, K; Yonebayashi, K				Nambu, K; Yonebayashi, K			Acidic properties of dissolved organic matter leached from organic layers in temperate forests	SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												The production of organic acids in forest organic layers is one of the major acid producing processes. In the organic layer leachates collected in Central Japan, the negative charge deficit between cations and inorganic anions ranged from 10 to 92% of the total positive charge of cations. The anion deficit was well correlated with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Carboxyl group contents in DOC and their pK(a) values were statistically optimized so that the anion deficit could be evaluated by the measurement of the DOC concentration and pH value. Optimized values for carboxylic group contents were in the range of 4.9 to 5.9 mu mol(c) mg(-1) C, which were lower than the amounts determined by titration, with the average values ranging from 5.7 to 7.8 mu mol(c) mg(-1) C. The optimized values were rather close to those with pK(a) less than 3.2 determined by the titration. The dissolved organic matter was fractionated into four groups according to hydrophobicity and acid-base properties. Hydrophobic acid fraction was the largest and accounted for 52 to 71% of the whole DOM. It contained about 10 mu mol(c) mg(-1) C of carboxylic groups, and 68+/-9% of them showed a pK(a) value of less than 3.2. Such a low pK(a) value of carboxylic groups is considered to have been caused by paired carboxylic groups with much higher pK(a) values, and hydroxyl groups. Hence the carboxylic groups were considered to exhibit a large range of pK(a) values. The carboxylic groups which were actually dissociated in the analyzed leachates were considered to be those with low pK(a) values. The estimation assuming a single pK(a) value did not give reliable results, and was biased in that it reflected the properties of the low pK(a) carboxylic groups. The proportion of the hydrophilic acid fraction was lower than that reported by other authors in cooler regions. The amounts of the carboxylic groups in the hydrophilic acids ranged from 16 to 22 mu mol(c) mg(-1) C, values about two times as high as those of hydrophobic acids.																	0038-0768					MAR	1999	45	1					65	77								WOS:000079128000005

Nutrient additions resulted in a large phytoplankton bloom, followed by a rapid decline. Despite this, DOC and CDOM increased slowly and linearly and were only weakly correlated with Chla. However, there were stronger correlations between CDOM and bacteria, and sedimentary CDOM fluxes varied from 0 to a value large enough to explain the increase of CDOM in the tanks. These results suggest that bacteria and sediments may be more important in CDOM production than phytoplankton on this time scale.				glibert, patricia/G-1026-2013	glibert, patricia/0000-0001-5690-1674												0143-1161					FEB 15	1999	20	3					627	641		10.1080/014311699213389						WOS:000078973300012		
J	Lee, CL; Kuo, LJ				Lee, CL; Kuo, LJ			Quantification of the dissolved organic matter effect on the sorption of hydrophobic organic pollutant: Application of an overall mechanistic sorption model	CHEMOSPHERE												This study presents an overall sorption model to estimate the sorption equilibrium coefficients of hydrophobic organic pollutants for heterogeneous aquatic systems. This proposed model combines a series of sorption equilibrium relationships including the adsorption of dissolved organic matters on particulates, the binding between organic pollutants and dissolved organic matters, and the sorption of organic pollutants on particulates with or without the presence of dissolved organic matters. By using this model, variations among the sorption equilibrium coefficients with the concentrations of dissolved organic matters are obtained. Also discussed herein are case studies involving pollutants having a wide spectrum of K(ow)s, different types of dissolved organic matters, different pH values and ionic strengths. In most of the case studies, the sorption equilibrium coefficients initially increase with the concentrations of dissolved organic matters and, then, decrease after reaching a maximum value. This study also addresses the relative errors of partition coefficients attributed to the negligence of the effect caused by the dissolved organic matter, the so-called third-phase effect.

The applied thermal methods are direct, in-source pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry in the high electric field (Py-FIMS), and Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in combination with library searches. Based on the identified building blocks and together with complimentary analytical data, proposals for a general concept of the basic molecular structures of humic macromolecules in water are put forward. Computational chemistry is utilized for structural modeling and geometry optimization of DOM. Molecular mechanics calculations are performed to evaluate the conformation of structural, three-dimensional models and to determine the total energy and the partial contributions from bond-, angle-, dihedral-, van der Waals-, stretch-bend-, and electrostatic energies. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) properties are calculated and allow the correlation of molecular structures with properties such as mass, surface area, volume, partial charges (electronegativity), polarizability, refractivity, hydrophobicity, and hydration energy. The principal aim and long-term strategy are to develop step by step improvements of the presented model structures of organic matter in water which explain the molecular composition as well as their ecological meaning, dynamic character, and structure-property relationships in natural and contaminated aquatic and terrestrial systems. In a first integrated approach, the dissociation and association processes of humic substances are simulated at nanochemistry level and are proposed as concepts for future collaboration incorporating results of additional chemical, biological, spectroscopic and microscopic methods.

The experimental set-up, using dialysis bags, was designed to expose test organisms to the same constant concentration of free dissolved chemical, while increasing the concentration of the bound-to-DOM fraction. Daphnia magna S. were exposed to pyrene or 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl in the presence of 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 or 20 mg L-1 of a reference riverine humic acid (Suwannee River Humic Acid). The physico-chemical parameters were well constrained in the microcosm, demonstrating its potential usefulness. However bioaccumulation by D. magna showed important variability between replicate treatments, sufficient to mask any trends as a function of DOM concentration. The organic-carbon-normalised partition coefficients (K-OC) ranged from 52000 to 92000 L kg(-1) for pyrene and from 8200 to 89000 L kg(-1) for 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, with a marked "concentration effect" for the latter compound.

Under aerobic conditions mineralization of amitrole is the main degradation pathway. The experiments revealed that the leaching behaviour is low in the presence or the absence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) despite the high water solubility due to a strong binding of amitrole to soil constituents. Under anaerobic conditions the addition of DOM increases the transport of amitrole in soil columns. The tests with water/sediment model ecosystems showed that the mineralization of amitrole is lower in comparison to aerobic soil experiments. Up to 80.6% of the applied C-14-labelled amitrole transfer into the sediment and about 1/3 of this amount formed bound residues, which are not extractable. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cores of undisturbed soil, taken from near the summit of Great Dun Fell (Cumbria, U.K.), were maintained at the summit (site A), and at three lower-altitude sites (B, C, and D) with higher mean temperatures and lower rainfall, for three years. Some cores at site A were heated, while some at site C received supplementary rain inputs. Leachate concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased in the order micropodzol < brown earth << peaty gley. Concentrations were highest in summer and autumn, and at the warmer, drier sites. Exported loads of DOC from the peaty gley at sites B, C, and D were approximately double that at site A, but the additional DOM was similar to that leached at site A, as judged by the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio and optical absorbance. Additional input water at site C significantly increased export from the brown earth and micropodzol. Exports were unaffected by heating at site A. It is concluded that warming and drying can accelerate the production of potential DOM within organic horizons, and that leaching is influenced by the adsorption of DOM in mineral horizons.

This paper presents experimental results showing that these compositional patterns are the outcome of selective partitioning of nitrogen-rich DOM components onto mineral surfaces. In every case, nitrogen was preferentially taken into the particulate fraction relative to the "parent" DOM, as were total hydrolyzable amino acids with respect to total organic carbon and nitrogen. Particulate amino acid compositional patterns also indicated preferential sorption of basic amino acids with positively charged nitrogen side chains. In short, all the various organic nitrogen compositional patterns of the Amazon Basin could be recreated in a beaker. While conjectured from POM/DOM compositional patterns among river samples, this is the first direct evidence for preferential uptake of naturally-occurring nitrogenous DOM by suspended riverine minerals.																			90-5809-073-6				1999							255	258								WOS:000082439800061

In this soil lysimeter study we successfully applied the natural C-13 abundance labelling technique to trace dung-C within a temperate grassland soil. Dung was collected from beef steers fed on either maize (a C-4 plant) or perennial ryegrass (a C-3 plant) silages, and applied to a freely draining (C-3) grassland soil. Leachates were collected from soil lysimeters (0 - 2.5) and (0 - 10 cm soil depth) to determine the organic carbon and C-13 content of < 0.7 mu m filtered solution. Leachates were taken from (i) control, no dung added, (ii) C-3 dung and (iii) C-4 dung amended soil. Results showed that, (i) the addition of dung resulted in a tenfold increase in C lost from the lysimeters in drainage waters, (ii) up to 50 % of the C present in the leachates was 'native' soil C and (iii) the application of dung produced a 'priming' effect. Further work is required to verify; (i) whether increased leaching of native C following dung application is a 'true priming' phenomenon, or merely the result of 'displacement' or 'pool substitution' of soil C, and (ii) the precise conditions and mechanisms under which organic amendments induce a true 'priming' effect in grassland and other agricultural soils.

DOC and DON correlated well (r = + 0.78), the slope of the regression line being 12.0 +/- 0.7 mol-C mol-N-1, about twice the Redfieldian slope of particulate organic matter, 6.5 +/- 0.2 mol-C mol-N-1 (r= +0.95). Labile DOC and DON accumulated in the upper 50 m during the upwelling season (March-September), mainly after prolonged periods of wind relaxation, when horizontal flows were reduced. This labile material represented 50% and 35% of the total (dissolved + particulate) organic carbon and nitrogen susceptible of microbial utilisation, which assert the key contribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the export of new primary production in the NW Iberian upwelling system. This surface excess in shelf waters appeared to be formed into the highly productive Ria de Vigo (a large coastal indentation) at net rates of similar to 4.4 mu M-C d(-1) and similar to 1.3 mu M-C d(-1) in the inner and outer segments of the embayment respectively, and subsequently exported to the shelf. Once in the shelf, simple dilution with the inert DOM pool of recently upwelled Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) occurred. Eventually, the DOM excess produced during the upwelling season is exported to the adjacent open ocean waters by the coastal circulation. Conversely, during the unproductive downwelling season (October-February), the lowest DOC and DON levels were recorded and export was prevented by the characteristic downwelling front associated to the seasonal poleward slope current.

J	Plaehn, WA; Zhao, XD; Dale, BE; Voice, TC				Plaehn, WA; Zhao, XD; Dale, BE; Voice, TC			Impact of dissolved organic matter on the desorption and mineralization rates of naphthalene	JOURNAL OF SOIL CONTAMINATION												The persistence of organic contaminants in plant-soil systems will be largely determined by the basic processes controlling bioavailability: desorption and biodegradation. Both processes can be affected by the presence of and variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM). To evaluate potential effects of DOM in surface soil remediation systems the kinetics of naphthalene desorption from soil and mineralization in soil solution in the presence of DOM were studied in completely mixed batch reactors (CMBRs). Three different DOM solutions were studied. These were obtained from water extraction of two different soils (muck-highly organic and alfalfa field-agricultural) and a third prepared by reconstituting a fulvic acid reference standard purchased commercially. Neither the desorption rate nor equilibrium partitioning of naphthalene was affected by the presence of varying DOM solutions. The effect on mineralization was evaluated based on an evaluation of a first-order rate constant produced by nonlinear regression of data fitted to a (CO2)-C-14 production model. For the muck DOM solution, alfalfa DOM solution, and fulvic acid DOM solution, first-order rate constants were 0.0474, 0.0657 0.0422 min(-1), respectively. Using uncertainty analysis, these differences were found not to be significant at a 90% confidence level. Although not apparent in this data, the impact of DOM on the mechanisms of desorption and biodegradation in a plant-soil environment may be important for other contaminant/organism/soil combinations. With the increased interest in phytoremediation and land farming as means of treating organic contaminants, further investigation of such interactions may be warranted.																	1058-8337						1999	8	4					491	507								WOS:000081785700005

Diverse sources, compositional complexity and multiple transformation pathways have made it difficult to generalize about the bioavailability of this material. Recently, there has been dramatic progress in identifying sources of DOM, describing its composition and tracing its movement through microbial food webs. A number of conceptual, mechanistic and empirical approaches have been proposed to synthesize this rapidly expanding body of knowledge. This paper reviews these approaches, and some general hypotheses for focusing future research are proposed. As a first step in synthesizing the available information, predictions are made about how variability in sources, hydrology and biotic removal interact to generate temporal and spatial patterns in DOM from a stream's headwaters to a large river.																	1323-1650						1999	50	8					781	790		10.1071/MF99069						WOS:000083848700008

We studied how the mobility and coagulation of dissolved organic matter and pH affected the mobility of Cu in contaminated sandy soil by batch and column experiments in the laboratory. The soil, with pH ranging from 3.8 to 5.7, had been polluted with Cu in the range 0.13-1.9 mmol kg(-1) more than a decade ago. Calcium and Cu bound by dissolved organic matter (purified humic acid) was determined in the pH range 4-8; Cu2+ concentration ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-12) M land Ca2+ concentration from 10(-3) to 10(-6) M. Binding of Cu by dissolved organic matter as affected by Ca and pH could be predicted well with the non-ideal competitive adsorption (NICA) model. Coagulation of dissolved organic matter was affected by the amount of trivalent (Al3+) and divalent (Ca2+ and Cu2+) cations in solution. There was little effect of pH on coagulation between pH 4 and 6. The concentration of the divalent cations, Ca2+ and Cu2+, at which coagulation of dissolved organic matter appeared could be explained by differences in the binding of Ca and Cu by dissolved organic matter. Binding of Cu by dissolved organic matter as well as by solid organic matter, both affected by Ca and pH, could be described well with the NICA model. We investigated the coagulation and mobility of dissolved organic matter in column experiments and found that they enhanced Cu mobility. Three processes, Cu desorption by soil, dissolved organic matter coagulation and Cu complexation by dissolved organic matter, act simultaneously in the soil columns. All three with counteracting effects on Cu mobility are influenced by Ca and pH and could be adequately represented by the multicomponent NICA model.																	1351-0754					DEC	1998	49	4					617	628		10.1046/j.1365-2389.1998.4940617.x						WOS:000077815500010		
J	Biersmith, A; Benner, R				Biersmith, A; Benner, R			Carbohydrates in phytoplankton and freshly produced dissolved organic matter	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Four taxonomically-diverse, phytoplankton cultures (Phaeocystis sp., Emiliania huxleyi, Synechococcus bacillaris, Skeletonema costatum) were grown in batch culture for 14 days, and the particulate and high-molecular-weight dissolved components of the cultures were harvested by tangential-flow ultrafiltration for bulk and molecular-level carbohydrate analyses. Bulk carbohydrates and neutral aldoses accounted for an average of 37% and 20%, respectively, of the particulate organic carbon(> 0.1 mu m) in the cultures. Glucose was the dominant aldose in phytoplankton cellular material. Ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter (UDOM; > 1000 Da) from the cultures was rich in carbohydrates relative to cellular material. Bulk carbohydrates and neutral aldoses accounted for an average of 66% and 35%, respectively, of UDOM in the cultures. The average C/N value (21.6) for UDOM was much higher than the value (8.8) for cellular material, reflecting the carbobydrate-rich nature of UDOM. Freshly produced UDOM was characterized by similar contributions of several aldoses, including galactose, glucose, mannose, fucose, xylose, and arabinose. The aldose signatures of phytoplankton UDOM were distinct from the signatures for cellular material and were indicative of heteropolysaccharides. The UDOM produced in phytoplankton cultures was similar in nature to the UDOM isolated from various locations in the surface ocean. Surface ocean UDOM is rich in carbohydrates and is relatively depleted in nitrogen (C/N similar to 17), and the aldose signature of marine UDOM is similar to that of phytoplankton UDOM.

Measurements were made of the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in thawing soil and runoff waters in the foothills region of the Kuparuk River basin of arctic Alaska, during the thaw of May 1996. Incubations were performed using DOC and soil cores at the time of thaw from the surface layers of two major tundra types of the region, nonacidic and acidic tundra. Results indicated that there are major changes in both the quantity and quality of DOC as soil waters thaw and move to the streams and lakes. DOC concentrations were found to be reduced up to 90% as soil waters thawed and became free-flowing soil waters with leachates from thawed soil cores averaging 116 mg DOC/L at thaw and soil waters averaging 20 mg DOC/L. Stream and inlet to Toolik Lake DOC concentrations averaged 12 and 10 mg DOC/L respectively indicating further dilution of DOC. Quality differences elucidated by XAD-8/4 resin fractionation of DOC were observed for waters at various points in the ecosystem. The hydrophilic neutral fraction (HIN) accounted for 71% of the DOC in waters of thawing soil cores, but was only 23% in flowing waters of soils, and 9-20% in stream waters. A 14 day 4 degrees C incubation of DOC from thawing soil core waters reduced DOC an average of 39%, with 80% of that reduction occurring in the HIN fraction.. Soil waters and stream waters were similar in DOC fraction composition, and fulvic acid fractions were dominant. Initial 14 day DOC respiration rates with high HIN waters were 10 mg CO2-C/g DOC/d, and reduced to 1.2-1.7 mg CO2-C/g DOC/d after 34 days incubation. Respiration rates of thawed cores ranged from 0.12 to 0.06 and 0.03 mg CO2-C/g C/d for nonacidic and acidic cores, respectively.

Fluorescence spectra of the three pesticides were characterized as follows: carbofuran and carbaryl fluoresce at 305 and 330 nm, respectively, upon excitation at 276-279 nn, whereas, aldicarb shows broad emission at 350-380 nm upon excitation at 326 nm. A fluorescence quenching technique was used to obtain conditional binding constants for the carbamate pesticides with Aldrich humic acid under fixed conditions of 22 degrees C and pH 6. The binding constant of carbofuran with humic acid is greater than the binding constants of both carbaryl and aldicarb. Estimates were also obtained for the binding of carbofuran with DOM samples from a coniferous forest soil O horizon, a deciduous forest soil O horizon, a sedge marsh wetland, and a stream in the drainage sequence and their molecular weight (MW) fractions. Those conditional binding constants were used to predict the potential transport of carbofuran in the drainage sequence. When binding constants and DOM concentrations were both taken into account, it was found that DOM from the coniferous forest O horizon had the largest capacity to bind and to transport carbofuran in the drainage sequence. SSFS was used to probe the binding mechanisms of DOM with carbofuran. Overall, the potential mobility of carbofuran in the upland-wetland-stream drainage sequence was significantly enhanced via binding with DOM. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The results of the binding and release experiments using radioactively C-14-labelled amitrole led to the conclusion that the binding of amitrole is very low. About 70 % of amitrole bound to humic substances was not extractable. The releasable amitrole portion of the purified DOM-amitrole complexes led to a harmful effect in the cress test. Solid-state cross polarisation (CP) magic angle spinning (MAS) N-15-NMR spectroscopy is a powerful spectroscopic method to elucidate the structure of bound xenobiotics.

Hydrophobic (a mixture of both humic and fulvic) acids dissolved more mercury than hydrophilic acids and other nonacid fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Cinnabar dissolution by isolated organic matter and natural water samples was inhibited by cations such as Ca2+. Dissolution was independent of oxygen content in experimental solutions. Dissolution experiments conducted in DI water (pH = 6.0) had no detectable (<2.5 nM) dissolved mercury. The presence of various inorganic (chloride, sulfate, or sulfide) and organic ligands (salicylic acid, acetic acid, EDTA, or cysteine) did not enhance the dissolution of mercury from the mineral. Aromatic carbon content in the isolates (determined by C-13 NMR) correlated positively with enhanced cinnabar dissolution. zeta-potential measurements indicated sorption of negatively charged organic matter to the negatively charged cinnabar (pH(pzc) = 4.0) at pH 6.0. Possible mechanisms of dissolution include surface complexation of mercury and oxidation of surface sulfur species by the organic matter.

Ratch equilibrium techniques mere used to determine the effects of four sewage sludges (liquid-SS, solid-SS, limed-SS, and composted-SS) and their water dissolved organic matter (DOM), on the sorption-desorption of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) by a silt loam soil. Atrazine sorption on the sludges increased in the order: limed-SS < liquid-SS < solid-SS < composted-SS. Sludge addition to soil increased atrazine sorption in the same order, although the effectiveness of the mixtures to sorb atrazine was lower than expected from the sorption capacity of the isolated soil and sludges. The effects of the DOM extracted from the different sludges on atrazine sorption varied with sewage sludge, For liquid-, solid-, and limed-SS, DOM reduced atrazine sorption on soil. A low association between these DOMs and atrazine was measured In solution by dialysis technique, and indicated that processes st the soil/solution interface may have contributed to reduce atrazine sorption, In contrast, enhanced atrazine sorption in the presence of DOM extracted from composted-SS indicated atrazine was hound by DOM associated with the soil. Atrazine desorption from sail increased in the presence of DOM from all four sludges; however, DOMs had little effect on atrazine desorption from sludge and from sludge-amended soil. Interactions of soil surfaces with organic amendments and their DOM are shown in this work as a major process determining atrazine sorption-desorption in amended soil.

The influence of DOM on absorbance decay at 551 nm, which represents the wavelength for maximum absorption of the oxidized species of DPD (DPD+), were investigated in detail. Significant decrease in the absorbance at 551 nm was observed in the presence of HA and gallic acid. This resulted in a fadeout of the purple color of DPD+, which, in term, created great difficulties in the measurement of H2O2 in solutions which contain DOM. To remove DOM prior to the addition of coloring reagents, a diethylaminoethyl Sephadex A-25 ion exchanger was used prior to the analysis for pre-separation. It was found that this pre-separation was useful in the DPD colorimetric determination of H2O2 the solution which contain DOM. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Even small riparian wetlands are important modifiers of stream chemistry. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the most important products exported by wetlands in streams. Stratigraphic control of hydraulic conductivity generally leads to decreasing conductivity with depth. Thus important flowpaths occur in the uppermost organic rich layers and are reflected in chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Accumulation of DOC in peat porewaters is the net effect of production, consumption and transport. DOC profiles vary with degree of interaction with the surrounding upland catchment and distance from the edge of the wetland as well as internal processes within the wetland. In wetlands, DOM production is offset by flushing resulting in decreasing DOC concentrations with increasing flows. Despite old carbon (2,000 to 3,000 years) at relatively shallow depths, (14)C activity in DOC exported from wetlands is mostly modem (recent carbon), consistent with shallow flowpaths and export of DOM from shallow organic rich horizons. In contrast, the source area for DOM in upland catchments with developed B horizon soils increases with antecedent soil moisture conditions resulting in increasing DOC concentrations with higher stream flows. Activity of 14C in stream DOC from upland catchments span a range from low activities (older carbon) similar to B horizon soil water during dry moisture conditions to values slightly less than modern (more recent carbon) during high moisture conditions. The more modern carbon activities reflect the increased contribution of the organic rich litter and A horizon soil layers in the area immediately bordering the stream under wet antecedent moisture conditions. Reduced hydrologic export or loss of wetlands under drier climatic conditions may result in in larger fluctuations in stream DOC concentrations and reduced DOM loads to lakes.

J	Gao, HZ; Zepp, RG				Gao, HZ; Zepp, RG			Factors influencing photoreactions of dissolved organic matter in a coastal river of the southeastern United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Photoreactions of dissolved organic matter can affect the oxidizing capacity, nutrient dynamics, trace gas exchange, and color of surface waters. This study focuses on factors that affect the photoreactions of the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Satilla River, a coastal river that has high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (2.0 +/- 0.2 mM C) and iron (12 +/- 2 mu M) in its freshwater reach. Quantum yields for the photoproduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbon monoxide (CO) from Satilla CDOM decreased exponentially in the 300-450 nm spectral region. Photoreaction of the CDOM in sunlight caused a decrease in UV and visible absorbance that occurred most rapidly in the UV-B (280-315 nm) region, indicating that CDOM photoreactions can enhance exposure of aquatic organisms to DNA-damaging UV radiation. The role of iron in the photooxidation was investigated by adding fluoride ions or deferoxamine mesylate (DFOM) to the water to form unreactive Fe3+ complexes, thus inhibiting iron photoreduction and slowing CDOM photooxidation. Using this method, it was demonstrated that the photoformation of DIG, CO, and NH4+ is strongly affected by iron catalysis in the Satilla River water. Increasing the dioxygen content and lowering the pH accelerated the photoreaction of the CDOM. CDOM photoreaction was accompanied by conversion of dissolved iron and carbon to particulate forms. Such "photocoagulation" may contribute to the transport of iron and carbon from surface waters to sediments in sunlit, well-stratified aquatic ecosystems.																	0013-936X					OCT 1	1998	32	19					2940	2946		10.1021/es9803660						WOS:000076222600039		
J	Thimsen, CA; Keil, RG				Thimsen, CA; Keil, RG			Potential interactions between sedimentary dissolved organic matter and mineral surfaces	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The sorptive properties of pore water organic matter and organic matter easily extracted from marine sediments were examined in a series of batch adsorption and desorption experiments. Pore water natural organic matter (pNOM) and easily extracted natural organic matter (eNOM) were isolated from Sinclair Inlet, WA (USA) sediments. The NOM fractions were concentrated similar to 9 times via rotoevaporation and then sorbed to, and desorbed from, organic-free sediment, sediment size fractions (63-250, 38-63 and < 38 mu m), montmorillonite and iron oxide. Sorption isotherms of pNOM varied little with changing sediment grain size or mineralogy, and Freundlich linearity coefficients (n) were all near 1 (range 0.65-1.15). eNOM was more heterogeneous in its sorption to the various surfaces, having a wider range of linearity coefficients (0.38-1.36) and a greater tendency to sorb to the montmorillonite. Average partition coefficients (K(d)) for the pNOM and eNOM were small (0.1 +/- 0.04 and 0.08 +/- 0.03 l g(-1)), illustrating only a low affinity for the surfaces. Hystereses observed in the desorption isotherms relative to the adsorption isotherms extrapolate back to the origin, suggesting that the sorption of NOM was reversible. A multiple-component model fit to the sorption and desorption data suggests that both the pNOM and eNOM fractions can be described as similar to 1:2 mixtures of two components with average K(d)'s of 3.2 and 0.02 l g(-1), respectively. This result was confirmed in a cumulative adsorption experiment, where less than 40% of the pNOM was found to be surface-reactive. The overall similarity of the sorptive properties of pNOM and eNOM suggest that the two isolates are subgroups of a single sedimentary NOM pool. At natural sediment porosities between 0.5 and 0.95, pNOM is buffered by a surface-bound eNOM pool that is many times larger than the pNOM pool with which it is undergoing exchange.

A graphical representation of the available data gives an overview of the magnitude of the observed effects. Most of the studies have shown decreases in bioconcentration in the presence of DOM (2 to 98% relative to DOM-free controls). However, at low DOM levels, up to 10 mg/L, also enhancements of bioconcentration due to DOM, ranging from 2 to 303% have been reported. Generally, the change in BCFw (Bioconcentration factor on a wet weight basis) per mg/L DOC was most pronounced at low levels of DOG. The data also show that DOM from different sources with different characteristics and quality can lead to substantial variations in the bioconcentration of organic compounds at comparable levels of DOG. While decreases in bioconcentration have generally been attributed to a lack of bioavailability of DOM-bound chemical, no mechanisms have been proposed to explain increased uptake of xenobiotics caused by DOM.

Organic matter amendments to soil are generally thought to improve soil quality, but pesticide application to these soils may lead to groundwater contamination problems. The complexation of pesticides with a water-soluble carrier such as dissolved organic matter (DOM) may facilitate chemical movement through soil. Sewage sludge amendments may lead to greater downward movement of organic chemicals if associated with DOM, Napropamide [2-alpha-napthoxy)-N,N-diethylpropionamide] was applied to a silt loam soil,vith (SS) and without (NoSS) sewage sludge application. Laboratory batch equilibrium and soil column studies were performed to determine the potential for herbicide complexation with DOM, Over 98% of the herbicide in soil columns followed typical adsorption and transport behavior as the center of mass of the lower organic matter soil (NoSS) moved twice the depth as that of SS, However, napropamide was detected in the initial leachate eluted from repacked soil columns with steps taken to prevent preferential now, Napropamide concentrations in the initial leachate of SS were twice that from NoSS with <1.5% of the total applied chemical mass eluting from the bottom of each column. A strong positive relationship was found between napropamide concentration and DOM content in soil leachates, Equilibrium dialysis methods were used to determine that napropamide moving through the soil columns was complexed with DOM, The results show that DOM can facilitate herbicide movement through soil and that sewage sludge-derived DOM mag lead to enhanced chemical transport in sludge-amended soils.																	0047-2425					SEP-OCT	1998	27	5					1194	1200								WOS:000076059600025		
J	Vinebrooke, RD; Leavitt, PR				Vinebrooke, RD; Leavitt, PR			Direct and interactive effects of allochthonous dissolved organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and ultraviolet radiation on an alpine littoral food web	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) may regulate littoral food webs by both modifying nutrient availability and attenuating potentially damaging ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These hypotheses were tested in a three-factor (DOM, inorganic nutrients, and WR) experiment using 24 littoral enclosures in an alpine lake located in Banff National Park, Canada. DOM was extracted from treeline soils and added (3 mg DOM liter(-1)) to +DOM enclosures over 1 month. These amendments were intended to simulate increases in allochthonous inputs that might occur as climate warming promotes the development of treeline soils and vegetation. DOM amendments significantly increased epilithon biomass (as total chlorophyll, carotenoids) but did not affect the abundance of either epipelon or phytoplankton. in addition, natural UV irradiance significantly enhanced the positive effect of DOM on epilithon and directly increased the abundance of epipelon. Threefold amendments of ambient nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (20 N:1 P, by weight) significantly increased epilithon abundance. The positive effects of DOM, NP, and UVR on phytobenthos were primarily attributable to the increased abundance of diatoms, whereas NP affected phytoplankton by increasing chrysophytes and dinoflagellates. DOM amendments did not significantly affect the final abundances of heterotrophic bacteria and protists but did result in significantly higher densities of omnivorous copepod nauplii. These results show that allochthonous DOM is an important resource for littoral food webs in oligotrophic lakes; however, its effects are mediated by UVR and differ between benthic and planktonic habitats. Our findings suggest that littoral food-web structure in clear, shallow lakes and ponds is altered by fluctuations in allochthonous inputs and UVR exposure arising from droughts and long-term climatic change.

Data collected at the Hawaii Ocean Time-Series (HOT) Station ALOHA from October 1988 to July 1997 indicate that daytime particulate organic carbon (POC) production, based on 12-h (14)C in situ incubations, averages 472 mg C m(-2) d(-1) (SD = 125 mg C m(-2) d(-1); n = 70). This carbon production rate is two- to three-fold greater than most of the pre-1980 estimates. We present evidence that particulate production rates may have been overestimated by up to 30% as a result of (14)C-labeled dissolved organic carbon ((14)C-DOC) adsorption onto glass fiber filters. More importantly, when one considers the (14)C-DOC that is produced but not adsorbed onto the filters, gross primary production rates ((14)C-POC plus (14)C-DOC) in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean may approach 1 g C m(-2) d(-1). We hypothesize that the large flux of (14)C-DOC may be a manifestation of decade-scale habitat changes resulting from variations in climate. The balance between POC and DOC production will ultimately influence the structure of the food web, especially the interactions of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacterial populations, and the mechanisms and rates of carbon sequestration by the biological pump.

J	Chin, YP; Traina, SJ; Swank, CR; Backhus, D				Chin, YP; Traina, SJ; Swank, CR; Backhus, D			Abundance and properties of dissolved organic matter in pore waters of a freshwater wetland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The abundances, molecular weights, molar absorptivities, and polydispersities of sediment pore water dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ferrous iron, Fe(II), were measured from three sites within a freshwater wetland (Old Woman Creek) adjacent to Lake Erie. DOM concentrations (expressed as organic carbon) increased with depth. Number-average molecular weight, weight-average molecular weight, and molar absorptivities (at 280 nm) also increased with depth up to 5 cm and remained relatively constant below this depth. These properties are indicative of the respective changes in the size of the DOM constituents and the number of aromatic moieties present. Moreover, a strong correlation was observed between Fe(II) and DOM, which suggests that both constituents coaccumulate in these pore fluids. It is hypothesized that reduction of iron oxides coated with organic matter releases both DOM and Fe(II). Increases in the molecular weights and molar absorptivities of the DOM constituents suggest that the "sorbed" component released by iron oxide dissolution is composed of larger and more aromatic molecules. The molecular-weight data also suggest that much of the refractory organic carbon in the interstitial waters comprises smaller-than-expected polymeric molecules. Thus, the release of the sorbed organic materials during the reductive dissolution of the oxide phases in anoxic sediments coupled with the selective preservation of refractory organic components may play an important role in both the DOM-mediated fate of pollutants and the cycling of carbon in wetlands.																	0024-3590					SEP	1998	43	6					1287	1296								WOS:000076791700022

Seawater samples were collected from eight depths (15-1,000 m), passed through 0.2-mu m pore-size filters, and exposed to sunlight in quartz bottles in a flowing seawater deck incubator for 5-9 h. Following sunlight exposure, samples were inoculated (1:10) with unfiltered seawater from 15-m depth, and bacterial growth rates were estimated from rates of H-3-leucine incorporation in dark incubations. Exposure of surface-water DOM to sunlight resulted in a 75% reduction in bacterial production, whereas exposure of deep-water DOM resulted in a 40% enhancement in bacterial production. Photomineralization of bioreactive DOM likely contributed to the reduction of bacterial growth in surface water, but the photoproduction of biorefractory DOM also appeared to contribute to reduced bacterial growth. Enhanced bacterial growth in irradiated deep water was consistent with previous studies demonstrating the photoproduction of bioavailable substrates from deep-water DOM. Phototransformations of DOM appeared to be multifaceted and to play a critical role in the cycling of DOM in the ocean.

J	Ismaili, MM; Belin, C; Lamotte, M; Texier, H				Ismaili, MM; Belin, C; Lamotte, M; Texier, H			Distribution and characterisation by fluorescence of the dissolved organic matter within the central Channel waters.	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												Intensity and spectral characteristics of the fluorescence of water samples collected along the transect Cherbourg-Isle of Wight during four cruises for excitations at 370, 313 and 270 nm have been investigated within the framework of the FluxManche II program. Seasonal and spatial differences appeared to reflect on the one hand, variations in terrestrial inputs, and on the other hand, waters masses structuring. The observed linear variation of the fluorescence intensity with salinity indicates a gradual dilution of the continental humic material in going from the coasts to the central part of the English Channel. The largest signal was observed for the English coastal waters in agreement with important terrestrial inputs from the Solent river. While the fluorescence intensity was not found to be correlated with the DOG, it shows a good correlation with the nutrients. This result could indicate both a supply from terrestrial inputs and an almost simultaneous autochtonous regeneration. As similarly reported for waters in the eastern part of the French coastal zone, excitation at 313 nm gives evidence for the presence of two classes of fluorescent dissolved organic matter. These two fluorescent components are indicative of the simultaneous presence of continental humic substances and substances whose assignment to marine humic substances or to heterotrophic related substances are still an open question. As compared to the eastern part of the Channel along the French coasts, excitation at 270 nm indicates a lower content of protein-like compounds which may be related to a lower biological activity along the transect or may be due to the fact that the samplings were made out of the phytoplanktonic bloom period (April-May 1995).

At up to 1260 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), carbon assimilation was not saturated, although a 25% chlorophyll-a reduction in relation to the initial value at 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 28% at 1260 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was observed. The (DOC)-C-14 release was low at all irradiances investigated and dependent on carbon fixation; the highest release (4.8% of the total C-14 assimilated) was observed at 1260 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In a second experiment, C-14 assimilation by S. petersenii was measured at 130 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The subsequent loss of labeled particulate organic carbon ((POC)-C-14) and release of (DOC)-C-14 were determined during a 5-h period in which cells were incubated in nonlabeled medium at different irradiances. At 2000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) there was a 20.6% (POC)-C-14 loss. The values of (DOC)-C-14 release were low for both 2000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (4.9 and 4.6%, respectively). At lower irradiances, (DOC)-C-14 release was close to 2.0%. Preliminary analysis showed that the high molecular weight fraction released was an extracellular heteropolysaccharide.

J	Kaiser, K; Zech, W				Kaiser, K; Zech, W			Rates of dissolved organic matter release and sorption in forest soils	SOIL SCIENCE												Rapid percolation enhances dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport in soils. One reason for this is nonequilibrium conditions, which make the time-dependence of the sorption/desorption an important parameter. We investigated the time-dependent DOM release and sorption of four soils (one topsoil, three subsoils) with different properties (organic carbon (OC): 2-56 g kg(-1); dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate-extractable Fe: 2.4-21.9 g kg(-1); clay: 30-450 g kg(-1)) in batch experiments during a 24-h period. Release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) when a DOC-free solution was added occurred mainly within the first 15 min and then decreased drastically. After 2 to 4 h, the release almost stopped, but steady-state conditions were not reached within the experimental period. DOM, fractionation with XAD-8 adsorber resin showed that the major portion of the released DOC exhibited hydrophilic properties. At an addition of 14 mmol DOC kg(-1), the topsoil still released DOC. One subsoil, which was rich in Al and Fe oxides and low in OC, sorbed both hydrophilic and hydrophobic DOC strongly, with a preference for the hydrophobic fraction. The other two subsoil horizons showed a sorption of hydrophobic DOC that was accompanied by a steadily increasing release of hydrophilic DOC. This indicates competition between the two DOC fractions, with hydrophobic DOC having the stronger affinity to sorbent and displacing soil-bound hydrophilic substances. The reactions approached steady-state conditions after 2 to 4 h. The time-dependency of the release and sorption can be described adequately by the Elovich equation and the fractional-power model. In a few cases, the DOC release from soil was represented better by the parabolic-diffusion equation. The slope of the Elovich equation, which may be considered the apparent rate constant, was higher for the hydrophilic than for the hydrophobic DOC fraction. It is related to the ratio between OC and Al and Fe oxide content.

J	Weigand, H; Totsche, KU				Weigand, H; Totsche, KU			Flow and reactivity effects on dissolved organic matter transport in soil columns	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a prominent role in the transport of contaminants in porous media. As DOM has to be considered as a reactive component, now regime and sorbent reactivity should affect overall DOM transport in an important way. We focused on DOM transport in unsaturated column experiments using quartz sand (QS) and goethite-coated quartz sand (GS). Rate constrictions to DOM sorption were investigated by varying the volumetric now rate, while extent and reversibility of sorption were studied in consecutive adsorption and desorption steps. In the QS, DOM retention was low and unaffected by changes in now rate. Desorption-step breakthrough curves (BTCs) and mass balances show full reversibility of the sorption process. However, DOM retention in GS was significant and sensitive to now variation, indicative of nonequilibrium sorption. At lower now rates, DOM breakthrough exhibited a change in curvature (shoulder) due to the superimposition of two BTCs representing reactive and nonreactive DOM fractions. Transport was successfully modeled assuming these two fractions governed overall DOM mobility. At higher flow rates, the BTC shoulder vanished due to reduced contact time between the DOM and the solid phase (rate-limited sorption). Sorption of DOM on GS is accompanied by a marked rise in effluent pH, indicative of a ligand-exchange mechanism. Recovery of DOM during desorption was incomplete due to either partially irreversible sorption or strongly rate-limited desorption. Increased DOM mobility in the consecutive adsorption step resulted from partial blocking of sorption sites by the initial pulse of DOM.

The fraction of Cu, Zn, Cd and Cr (at 100 mu g/L) complexed with Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) was measured at salinities of 0,1, 3, 10, and 15 psu using 1000 Dalton ultrafiltration membranes. In distilled water, 10 mg SRHA/L bound at least 40% of each metal. Except for Cu, metal binding decreased to less than 20% at salinities between 1 and 15 pan. Copper binding decreased ro 27% at 3 psu, but increased to approximately 60% bound at 15 psu.

Toxicity test solutions at pH 6.5 +/- 0.1 with the required Cu speciation were designed using the chemical speciation model MINTEQA2, and the speciation was confirmed by Cu ion-specific electrode. In the absence of malonic acids, concentrations of Cu2+ up to 1.13 mu mol/L increased the embryo hatching time from approx. 2 d in control solutions (no Cu or malonic acid) and solutions containing malonic acids without Cu to approx. 8 d. The Cu-benzylmalonic acid complex (n-octanol/water distribution coefficient [p(ow)] = 0.00) in the presence of inorganic Cu species did not delay hatching beyond that attributable to Cu2+. I, contrast, 0.60 mu mol/L Cu-n-hexadecylmalonic complexes (p(ow) = 6.89) delayed hatching by 5.5 d in excess of that attributable to 1.13 mu mol/L Cu2+, assuming that the hatching delays caused by the different Cu species were additive, possibly because of Cu entry into the embryo as the lipophilic Cu-n-hexadecylmalonic complex. None of the Cu-malonic acid complexes was acutely toxic to adult zebrafish at concentrations up to 1.4 mu mol/L, possibly because Cu was removed from the Cu-malonic acid complexes by stronger chelating groups at the gill surface. Substituted malonic acids with similar proton and Cu association constants can be readily prepared with a variety of simple substituents, radiolabeled if required. Our results show that these acids could be useful ligands for investigating intracellular transport and metabolism of metal-organic complexes.																	0730-7268					AUG	1998	17	8					1538	1545		10.1897/1551-5028(1998)017<1538:TTEAAZ>2.3.CO;2						WOS:000075130900014

DOM is produced in significant amounts in the forest canopy and in the forest floor. A major part of the organic solutes are lignocellulose-degradation products being strongly microbially altered in the course of ligninolysis. The release of lignin-derived moieties into the soil solution is controlled by their degree of biooxidation. Microorganisms contribute also directly to the organic solutes through the release of microbial metabolites. DOM released from the forest floor passes the upper mineral soil almost conservatively, whereas in the subsoil most DOM is removed from solution. Immobilization of DOM is mainly due to sorption on Fe and Al oxides. The highly oxidized lignin-derived moieties are preferentially removed from the soil solution whereas the saccharides are relatively enriched. We conclude that DOM in the forest soil output to the hydrosphere is a result of (1) the release of microbially degraded lignocellulose compounds and of microbial metabolites into the forest floor solution and (2) selective sorptive removal of the lignin-derived constituents in the subsoil.

The growth rates, cell numbers, and biomasses of bacteria were substantially higher in the presence of DOM than in cultures without DOM. At the stationary phase of growth, 3.4-5.9% of the initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool was consumed, and the growth efficiency of bacteria varied between 18-56% depending on nutrient and DOM concentration in the cultures. The addition of phosphate and other extra nutrients resulted in substantially higher growth of bacteria and algae than without extra phosphate. In the presence of algae and protozoa, the cell numbers ail bacteria declined, demonstrating bacterial grazing by protists. Allochthonous DOM generally also enhanced the growth of algae. In particular, two chlorophyceans (Dictyosphaerium and Chlamydomonas) and a diatom (Synedra berolinensis) grew better when DOM concentration increased. However, DOM had no detectable effect on the growth of Cryptomonas (Cryptophyceae). The results of this study support the hypothesis that allochthonous DOM may strongly influence the structure and functioning of plankton food chains in humic lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The characteristics of DOM, its concentration, and the solution pH are important parameters governing the heavy metals uptake reaction. The characteristics of DOM of various wastewater and sludge (primary, secondary, and tertiary) samples collected from four municipal wastewater treatment plants were investigated. Results showed that the dissolution of DOM from sludge is significantly affected by pH and suspended solids concentration. Results also showed that DOM contains two discrete acid groups that are available for metals complexation. The site concentration and acidity constants were determined by an alkalimetric titration method. For all DOM samples studied, the acidity constants, pK(aA) and pK(aB), were 5.3 and 9.5, respectively. Based on the acidity constants and the Fourier transform infrared spectra, it is believed that the acid sites consist of carboxylic and amino functional groups. The density of the first acid site was approximately 10(-5) mol/mg chemical oxygen demand for all samples studied. However, the density of the second acid site varied significantly among the DOM samples investigated.																	1061-4303					JUL-AUG	1998	70	5					1041	1048		10.2175/106143098X123372						WOS:000075141100009

Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) were applied to characterize the DOM collected from lysimeters and its parent SOM. The macromolecular organic matter in the litter and fermentation (Lf) horizon of the soil consists primarily of little decomposed lignocellulose from grass, whereas the humus (Oh) horizon is characterized by an accumulation of selectively decomposed lignocellulose material, microbial metabolites and bound fatty acids. The mineral horizon produced a relative enrichment of furan structures derived from microbial reworking of plant polysaccharides but virtually no lignin signals. A series of exceptional long chain C-43 to C-53 fatty acids with odd over even predominance, probably derived from mycobacteria, were also identified in the Oh horizon. Side-chain oxidation and shortening, increase of carboxyl functionality and selective removal of syringyl (S) > guaiacyl (G) > p-hydroxyphenyl (P) lignin units were the main reactions when lignin degraded. Compared with SOM, the DOM shows a large accumulation of more oxidized lignin and aromatic structures, especially those containing carboxylic and dicarboxylic acid functionalities and with shorter side-chain length. The polysaccharide-type compounds in the DOM were more modified (greater abundance of furan structures in pyrolysis products), and had significantly lower molecular weight and more diverse polymeric structures than did those in soils. Increased temperature and rainfall appeared to result in greater relative abundance of Lignin degradation products and aromatic compounds in DOM.				bol, roland/H-9324-2013													1351-0754					MAR	1998	49	1					1	15		10.1046/j.1365-2389.1998.00141.x						WOS:000072675700001

Ne Fractionated the DOM into hydrophobic or hydrophilic neutrals, acids, and bases, and obtained solid state truss polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the unfractionated DOM and of the different fractions. The hydrophobic acid (HoA) fraction was the dominant hydrophobic fraction, exhibiting a moderate increase during composting. The hydrophobic neutral (HoN) fraction increased sharply while the hydrophobic bases (HoB) fraction decreased during composting. The hydrophilic neutrals (HiN) represented the major fraction of the hydrophiles until 120 d of composting, decreasing thereafter by 38%. The C-13-NMR spectra of the unfractionated DOM revealed an increasing level elf aromatic structures in the residual DOM with composting time. The C-13-NMR spectra of the HoA fraction suggested a polyphenol-humic structure, whereas the HoN spectra exhibited strong aliphatic features, The spectra of the HiN fraction confirmed its polysaccharide nature and the hydrophilic bases (HiB) fraction contained mainly proteins and carbohydrate-amino complexes, A comparison between the C-13-NMR spectra of HoA and fulvic acid (FA) indicated the former to be the most soluble FA fraction, The steady DOM concentration and the relative decrease of HiN as the HoA and HoN fractions increased indicates that DOW at the final stage of composting contained less bioavailable organic matter and more macromolecules related to humic substances. The constant level of DOM observed during the curing and maturation stages represents a steady-state situation during which the chemical composition is continually changing.																	0361-5995					MAR-APR	1998	62	2					326	332								WOS:000073242700005		
J	Chin, WC; Orellana, MV; Verdugo, P				Chin, WC; Orellana, MV; Verdugo, P			Spontaneous assembly of marine dissolved organic matter into polymer gels	NATURE												A large pool of organic carbon resides in the world's oceans in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM)(1,2). DOM is operationally defined as the fraction of organic matter that passes through a filter with a given pore size (which can range from less than 0.1 mu m to 0.46 mu m). This fraction has a longer oceanic residence time-and is generally less biodegradable-than particulate organic matter (POM)(1-4). Processes transforming DOM into POM are therefore crucial for our understanding of the cycling of organic material in the oceans(1-4). The aggregation of marine colloids, which constitute 10-40% of DOM(2,3,5), is thought to be an important step in the transformation of DOM into POM(3). it has been suggested that colloids, as well as transparent exopolymer particles and large aggregates ('marine snow') can be viewed as polymer gels(6-8). Whether free DOM polymers can indeed spontaneously assemble to form polymer gels has, however, not yet been shown, Here we present experimental observations that demonstrate that marine polymer gels can assemble from free DOM polymers, and that their formation mechanism, physical characteristics and mineralization can be understood in terms of polymer gel theory(9-11). The principles and methods of polymer gel physics thus have the potential to provide profound new insights into the processes controlling-the exchange between the DOM and POM pools and the cycling of marine organic matter.

J	Cai, WJ; Wang, YC; Hodson, RE				Cai, WJ; Wang, YC; Hodson, RE			Acid-base properties of dissolved organic matter in the estuarine waters of Georgia, USA	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The contribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to alkalinity in estuarine waters and its relationship to CO2 chemistry has not received much previous attention. In this paper, we present some of the first organic alkalinity measurements in the context of estuarine mixing, focusing on three rivers in the Southeastern US. The simple model presented here illustrates that the organic contribution to alkalinity in estuarine waters is largely controlled by the dramatic pH change in the early stage of the mixing. As mixing progresses, organic alkalinity becomes nearly conservative with respect to salinity change. Although no DOM removal during estuarine mixing was detected here, this work provides an alternative approach to evaluate the issues of colloid and small particle formation and coagulation during mixing. This paper demonstrates that a large fraction of the proton binding sites of humic substances is either completely protonated or deprotonated during the estuarine mixing processes and, therefore, that these sites contribute neither to alkalinity nor to proton transfer reactions. One class of chargeable sites may be adequate to model the acid-base properties of humic substances during the mixing process. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Kalbitz, K; Wennrich, R				Kalbitz, K; Wennrich, R			Mobilization of heavy metals and arsenic in polluted wetland soils and its dependence on dissolved organic matter	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The wetland soils of the Mulde river in the industrial district of Bitterfeld-Wolfen (Germany) are highly contaminated with heavy metals and arsenic. We studied the mobility of accumulated heavy metals and arsenic and the influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on element mobility. Undisturbed soil cores were taken from five different sites to represent a wide range of heavy-metal contamination, soil properties and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) concentrations. The acid-soluble concentrations (mostly equal to the total content) were up to 1100 mg kg(-1) for Zn, 800 mg kg(-1) for Cr, 364 mg kg(-1) for Cu, 265 mg kg(-1) for As and 37 mg kg(-1) for Hg, depending on the sampling site. Percolation experiments using small lysimeters with undisturbed topsoil cores illustrated a considerable mobilization of Zn, Cd, Cu, Cr and Hg, depending on soil properties. Up to 80 mu g 1(-1) Cd, 8 mg 1(-1) Zn, 130 mu g 1(-1) Cr, 160 mu g 1(-1) Cu and 7 mu g 1(-1) Hg were detected in the soil percolates. Arsenic mobilization was low. The concentration of Cr, Hg, Cu and As in the soil percolates was positively correlated with DOM. Besides the element content (mobile or acid-soluble), soil pH and soil characteristics describing the soil potential for heavy-metal adsorption (clay, oxides, cation exchange capacity), the DOC concentration in the soil solution should be known to access the potential mobilization of Hg, Cr, Cu and As. In contrast, Cd and Zn mobilization depends on soil pH and mobile element content, but not on DOM. Additional studies on two soil profiles (down to 1.5 m) confirmed the translocation of heavy metals from the highly contaminated topsoil into deeper soil horizons and into the groundwater and the influence of DOM as revealed with the percolation experiment. Our results also showed that DOM is of minor importance on the mobilization of heavy metals in soils with a low soil pH (< 4.5). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Raber, B; Kogel-Knabner, I; Stein, C; Klem, D				Raber, B; Kogel-Knabner, I; Stein, C; Klem, D			Partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to dissolved organic matter from different soils	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the soil solution or groundwater can have a considerable effect on the dissipation of hydrophobic organic pollutants. We used the fluorescence quenching technique as well as the reversed-phase separation technique to determine the partition coefficient of 3- to 5-ring PAH to dissolved organic matter from agricultural soils and forest floor materials. Several techniques (centrifugation, pressure filtration, and percolation) are compared for obtaining DOM solution most representative of the DOM in the natural soil solution to use for the sorption experiments. Centrifugation was shown to be the most suitable procedure to obtain DOM solutions in large quantities with a composition most similar to the field soil solution. PAH binding to DOM from mineral soil was found to be considerably lower compared to DOM from acid forest floor materials. These differences can partly be explained by compositional differences with respect to hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of DOM. Binding capacity of DOM was only slightly affected by changes in pH and electrical conductivity of the soil solution. The partition coefficients for DOM from soils are rather different to the data given for model DOM solutions, such as humic acids, fulvic acids, or Aldrich humic acid. To obtain realistic estimates for the effect of DOM on the mobility of hydrophobic organic chemicals in soils, it is essential to use DOM solutions representative of the dissolved organic matter in the soil solution.

B	Sonnenberg, LB; Holmes, JC			TAPPI	Sonnenberg, LB; Holmes, JC			Physicochemical characteristics of dissolved organic matter in untreated and treated pulp and paper mill wastewaters	INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE & EXHIBIT, BOOKS 1-3					1998 TAPPI International Environmental Conference and Exhibit	APR 05-08, 1998	VANCOUVER TRADE CONVENT CTR, VANCOUVER, CANADA	TAPPI	VANCOUVER TRADE CONVENT CTR			Common approaches to evaluating pulp and paper mill effluents are to measure bulk water quality parameters (e.g., BOD), or to measure regulated compounds that are present in trace quantities (e.g., chlorophenols). While these types of measurements have their advantages and serve specific needs, fundamental chemical information about the structure and properties of the bulk organic material in wastewaters provides better information for predicting and controlling its behavior during treatment. Physicochemical characteristics of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in several types of waters and wastewaters were evaluated. The dissolved organic carbon was profiled by its distribution into chemical categories including hydrophilic acids, bases, and neutral compounds, and hydrophobic acids and base/neutrals. One goal of the study was to characterize untreated and treated pulp and paper mill wastewaters to determine which compounds were readily removed and which types were resistant to biological removal. Results indicated that there is a net production of hydrophilic compounds during microbial treatment and a net reduction in acids, probably reflecting microbial metabolism. A second goal of the study was to compare the characteristics of treated effluents with naturally-occurring organic matter. The DOC in untreated pulp and paper mill wastewaters had distributions of chemical classes similar to naturally occurring organic matter in the blackwater system in the study, probably due to similar DOC precursors and physicochemical processes. The ecosystem we studied appeared to readily assimilate the organic matter introduced by wastewater discharge into naturally occurring organic carbon cycles.																			0-89852-713-9				1998							647	657								WOS:000073706800067

There were no obvious gradients or features along the river, except in the tributaries, the Aldan and Vilyuy rivers, where significantly higher concentrations of several parameters were measured. Concentrations of DOC varied between 300 and 1000 mu M C, with most values varying between 500 and 700 mu M C (mean 570 mu M C). DON concentrations ranged between 9 and 28 mu M N (mean 13 mu M N). The C/N ratios of bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM) varied from 30 to 58, with 75% of the values being between 45 and 55 (mean 48). Total dissolved amino acids (TDAA) ranged between 1.6 and 5.4 mu M, averaged about 3.5 mu M, mostly in the combined form, and represented about 28% of the DON. Free amino acids were only about 2% of TDAA. Glycine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid predominated, accounting for about 41% of TDAA. Total dissolved carbohydrates ranged from 190 to 470 mu g glucose equivalents l(-1) and averaged 299 mu g l(-1), forming only 1.2 to 2.5% of the DOC pool. The following ranges of inorganic nutrients were measured: nitrate, 0.01 to 1.4 mu M N (mean 0.6 mu M N); nitrite, 0.03 to 0.1 mu M N (mean 0.07 mu M N); ammonium, 0.01 to 0.3 mu M N (mean 0.13 mu M N); phosphate, 0.2 to 1 mu M P (mean 0.5 mu M P); silicate, 59 to 87 mu M Si (mean 66 mu M Si). Carbon isotope data of the suspended organic material suggest that the low inorganic nitrogen values are not due to algal uptake, but rather an inherent characteristic of the river and the catchment area. This, together with positive correlations between silicate, DOC and DON and high C/N values, suggests that the composition of DOM in the Lena River is mainly determined by the input of soil-derived, recalcitrant material and not by autochthonous sources.

J	Battin, TJ				Battin, TJ			Dissolved organic matter and its optical properties in a blackwater tributary of the upper Orinoco river, Venezuela	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were investigated in a blackwater tributary (river Surumoni) of the upper river Orinoco (South Venezuela) during November and December 1996. DOC concentrations were high (similar to 10 mg C L(-1)), relatively invariant in time and largely-decoupled from discharge. The Surumoni has the highest CDOM levels reported hitherto-with slopes of In-linearized absorption spectra ranging from 0.0085-0.0152 nm(-1), a mass specific absorption coefficient at lambda = 300 nm of 6.45 L mg(-1) m(-1). Optical signatures indicate that the CDOM is highly aromatic in nature and of terrestrial origin in the Surumoni, whereas autochthonous sources are also likely to contribute significantly to the Orinoco CDOM pool. Hydrologic connectivity of the active channel with fringing floodplains largely determined the spatio-temporal variation of CDOM in the Surumoni. The upriver channel is straight, braided in some reaches, and CDOM optical properties remained largely invariant along its course. Downriver, the meandering channel receives substantial amounts of highly degraded, aromatic material from extensive floodplains. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kaiser, K				Kaiser, K			Fractionation of dissolved organic matter affected by polyvalent metal cations	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of polyvalent cations known to form complexes with natural organic substances on the operational fractionation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) using XAD-I adsorber resin. Dissolved organic matter solutions from a forest floor were treated with increasing concentrations of polyvalent metal cations (Ca2+, Al3+, Fe3+) at different pH levels. Then the concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the distribution between hydrophilic and hydrophobic DOC were determined. The concentrations of total DOC decreased slightly when the C/metal ratio was less than 10, especially for Al and Fe. Hydrophilic DOC increased and hydrophobic DOC decreased with increasing concentrations of metal cations. Effects increased in the order Ca < Al < Fe and were more pronounced at low DOC concentrations and high pH values. The reason for the reduction of the DOC concentrations seemed to be the formation of insoluble metal-DOM complexes, while soluble metal-DOM complexes may induce an alteration of the distribution between hydrophilic and hydrophobic DOG. Thus, the polyvalent cations and their concentration need to be considered when DOM fraction distributions, determined with XAD-S resin, of different waters are compared, especially at low DOC contents and high pH.

Therefore, the mobility of the dissolved organic matter in the interstitial Boom Clay water is studied. For the first time, the mobile fraction present in the clay water is concentrated and labelled with a radioisotope to study the mobility of the organic matter in clay and the interaction of the mobile with the non-mobile. The isotopes tested as label are I-125 and C-14. The I-125 label proved to be unstable and hence discarded. The labelled organic matter is then diluted for migration experiments on Boom Clay cores under anaerobic conditions. The influence of the molecular size on its mobility is studied by the separation of the labelled organic matter in different size fractions.																	0033-8230						1998	82						375	378								WOS:000077683000060		
J	Kaiser, K; Zech, W				Kaiser, K; Zech, W			Soil dissolved organic matter sorption as influenced by organic and sesquioxide coatings and sorbed sulfate	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The sorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its fractions as influenced by organic C (OC), sesquioxides [amorphous Al(OH)(3), ferrihydrite, goethite], and extractable SO42- was investigated by modifying the properties of the Bs horizon of an Entic Haplorthod. Coating the Bs material with OC extracted from the Oa horizon of a mor forest boor layer decreased the sorption of total DOC. The effects on the sorption of the hydrophobic DOC fraction were little, whereas the sorption of the hydrophilic fraction was strongly reduced. At the highest OC coating levels, a net release of hydrophilic DOC occurred, indicating a displacement of indigenous hydrophilic substances from the soil by the sorbing hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (DOM). Coating of the soil material with sesquioxides clearly increased the sorption of DOC and its fractions. The strongest effects occurred when amorphous Al(OH)(3) was added, followed by ferrihydrite and goethite. Increased contents of extractable SO42- did not affect the sorption of DOC on soil material. With increasing addition of DOG, however, the concentrations of SO42- in the equilibrium solution increased. Adsorbing DOM seems to displace SO42- bound to soil materials. Thus, DOM shows a higher affinity to sorb on soil material than SO42-.				Kaiser, Klaus/J-1726-2014													0361-5995					JAN-FEB	1998	62	1					129	136								WOS:000072168900017		
J	Yamanaka, Y; Tajika, E				Yamanaka, Y; Tajika, E			Role of dissolved organic matter in the marine biogeochemical cycle: Studies using an ocean biogeochemical general circulation-model	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												A biogeochemical general circulation model which includes production and consumption processes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is developed. The semilabile and the refractory DOM are taken into account. The vertical distribution of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and the Delta(14)C value obtained in our model compares well with the recent observations. It is found that the double DOC maximum zone (DDMZ) extends in the east-west direction in the equatorial Pacific. Case studies, which change the decay time and production ratio constant, show that the horizontal distribution of DOC in the surface layer can be reproduced only when the decay time of the semilabile DOM is about half a year. The semilabile DOM exists only above a depth of 400 m, and its vertical and horizontal transport plays an important role in the marine biogeochemical cycle in the surface layer. However, below that depth, only the inert refractory DOM exists, and the role of the refractory DOM in the biogeochemical cycle is not important. The global export production due to the particulate organic matter (POM) and DOM at a depth of 100 m is estimated to be about 8 Gt C/yr and about 3 Gt C/yr, respectively. The vertical transport below 400 m is due almost entirely to POM.

J	Ciborowski, JJH; Craig, DA; Fry, KM				Ciborowski, JJH; Craig, DA; Fry, KM			Dissolved organic matter as food for black fly larvae (Diptera : Simuliidae)	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Black fly larvae occur in many lotic habitats but often dominate the benthos of lake-outlet and brownwater (humic) stream communities. Water in these habitats contains abundant dissolved organic material (DOM). Amorphous material commonly found on black fly labral fans was formerly but erroneously thought to be an endogenously produced glycoconjugate that aided particle capture. We hypothesized that architecture of the labral fans may cause in situ flocculation of DOM, which is then directly ingested. Half-grown Simulium vittatum Zetterstedt and S. piperi Dyer & Shannon larvae were held for 84 h in stir-bar-driven rearing chambers containing filtered water with or without 3.0 mg/L brewer's yeast and with or without 20.0 mg/L DOM (an aqueous extract of moss). Water was partially replaced every 6 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine particulate material from test water collected on membrane filters and to study labral fans of selected larvae from parallel experiments. Other larvae were longitudinally sectioned and stained with Aldan Blue, which detects glycoconjugates. Concentrations of DOM (determined by ultraviolet spectroscopy) and fine particulate organic matter (measured by filtration) in chambers did not change over 84 h. Larvae in control and DOM-only trials displayed aggregative behavior typical of severely food-limited simuliids, whereas larvae in yeast-supplemented trials were haphazardly arranged. Control larvae exhibited little or no growth (increase in mean body length). Larvae in both DOM and yeast-supplemented treatments grew significantly more than control larvae, achieving growth rates of 4.0-17.0%/d (DOM-only), 11.3-14.8%/d (yeast-only), or more. Guts of larvae from all treatments stained positively, indicating that they contained glycoconjugates. Filters and labral fans examined by SEM contained yeast cells but not bacterial cells. However, labral fans also lacked evidence of adhering glycoconjugates. Small quantities of amorphous material consistent with flocculated DOM were observed on filters. Simuliid larvae can grow in a medium containing only allochthonously derived DOM. Although evidence is inconclusive, we speculate that DOM is precipitated on labral fans and ingested. Under natural conditions, DOM may be a direct and significant food source for simuliid larvae.																	0887-3593					DEC	1997	16	4					771	780		10.2307/1468170						WOS:000071795200004		
J	Gigliotti, G; Giusquiani, PL; Businelli, D; Macchioni, A				Gigliotti, G; Giusquiani, PL; Businelli, D; Macchioni, A			Composition changes of dissolved organic matter in a soil amended with municipal waste compost	SOIL SCIENCE												A spectroscopic study was carried out to determine the changes in composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a soil repeatedly amended with a municipal waste compost. In addition to humic-like substances, composted products contain dissolved organic matter composed of a complex mixture of relatively low molecular weight polymeric materials. The FT-IR and H-1-NMR spectra of DOM extracted from a clay-loam soil (SDOM), municipal waste compost (CDOM), and soil-compost mixtures incubated for varying time periods are reported. One of the incubated samples was taken from a freshly prepared laboratory mixture (LASDOM); the rest were taken from a 6-year field experiment on the soil collected at four months (6YASDOM) after the last amendment. The analyses were carried out also on a CDOM sample after being kept in contact with the soil for 24 h (BEER). The main findings of the IR and H-1-NMR spectra concern polysaccharides and olefinic groups. The former increased in concentration in both 6YASDOM (vs. SDOM and LASDOM), and BEER (vs. CDOM). The 6YASDOM finding proves that the increase in polysaccharides was caused by the evolution of the added municipal waste compost rather than by a direct addition of the compost. The polysaccharide increase in BEER testifies to a selective adsorption by the soil of humus-like organic macromolecules containing COOH groups, thereby increasing the concentration of the less adsorbed hydrophilic polysaccharide molecules, which would also explain the increase in polysaccharides in the 6YASDOM. Conversely, the concentration of olefinic groups was high in SDOM and low in CDOM, LASDOM, and BEER. This finding supports the hypothesis that the highly reactive olefinic groups present in SDOM react rapidly with CDOM molecules, thus lowering their concentration. In conclusion, compared with soil DOM, the increase of polysaccharides and the decrease of olefinic groups seem to be the most important characteristic of DOM in soils amended with municipal waste compost.

J	Afcharian, A; Levi, Y; Kiene, L; Scribe, P				Afcharian, A; Levi, Y; Kiene, L; Scribe, P			Fractionation of dissolved organic matter from surface waters using macroporous resins	WATER RESEARCH												To obtain fractions enriched with biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) or with organic compounds responsible for the chlorine demand (CID) and for trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), Seine river water samples were percolated on various macroporous resins (anionic, cationic and non-ionic) and compared with granulated activated carbon (GAG). In addition, measurement of UV absorbance at 254 nm and the fluorescence index (lambda(excitation) 320 nm) had allowed to follow up the retention of dissolved organic matter by the different adsorbants. In contrast to cationic and non-ionic resins, anionic resins confirm their excellent retention capacity of organic compounds responsible for UV 254 absorbance and fluorescence index. The relative values of BDOC/DOC ratio (mg-C/mg-C) are slightly increased in the effluents of anionic resins, indicating that they retain a little preferentially the refractory fraction instead of the biodegradable fraction. There is no significant difference between the ratio of CID/DOC (mg-Cl-2/mg-C) in influent and effluent of anionic resins. Cationic resin has a low capacity for retention of DOG, but they seem to retain significantly the organic compounds responsible for ClD. The capability of anionic resins to retain THMFP is similar to that of GAG. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The recovery experiments were performed using a PCBs commercial mixture (Fenchlor 54). All the experiments were conducted at constant ionic strength, buffering the pH of the aqueous samples with universal buffer. Commercial humic acid was used to simulate natural DOM. An experimental design approach was used to estimate the effect of the simultaneous variation of both humic acid and pH on the extraction recovery of PCBs. The data obtained confirmed the presence of strong interactions among humic acid and PCBs. The organic matter present in the sample may significantly affect the PCBs extraction and such an effect is strongly dependent on the pH. The maximum extraction recovery of PCBs is obtained at a value of pH around 9.

DOM was fractionated with XAD-2 resin into hydrophobic (acid and neutral, ''humic'') and hydrophilic fractions. The combined amino acid contents of unfractionated filtered seawater, XAD-fractions and particulate material were determined during the growth, stationary and degradation phases of the culture, and variations related to changes in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in XAD-fractions, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, algal and bacterial biomass. XAD-fractionation enabled the discrimination of simultaneously ocurring release and uptake of organic nitrogenous compounds: During the diatom growth there was a net increase of total DON concentrations, which was mostly accounted for by the hydrophilic fraction. A concurrent heterotrophic uptake of combined amino acids and other non-amino acid organic nitrogen was discernible by the decrease of their concentrations in the hydrophobic fractions. In the stationary phase, during the prevailing net consumption of total DON, the production of algal exudates could be detected in the hydrophobic fractions, while uptake mainly involved non-amino acid organic nitrogen from the hydrophilic fraction. During the degradation phase, after two months part of the particulate amino acid pool was transformed into hydrophilic DON, which in contrast to the stationary phase, was not adequate for supporting sustained bacterial growth. This suggests that the generation of recalcitrant substances may begin in the hydrophilic fraction of DOM. A slight increase of the hydrophobic acid fraction was indicative of the incipient formation of humic substances. XAD-2 was able to adsorb substances from fast changing DOM pools and thus should be a useful tool in studies concerned with phytoplankton and bacterial dynamics.

Natural DOM of four size fractions ranging from 1 K molecular weight up to 1 mu m was isolated from Jack Lake and Luther Marsh in Ontario, Canada, and compared to the commercial DOM substitute Aldrich humic acid (AHA). A generator column method to produce fenvalerate-saturated DOM solutions necessary for determining K-rp was compared to the standard method of mixing the components in a bottle until equilibrium was reached. Using the bottle method, the association of fenvalerate to DOM was not significantly different (alpha = 0.05) for any of the DOM. With the generator column-produced solutions, the mean K-rp of the smallest fraction (1 K < DOM < 10 K) was significantly lower (2.2 x 10(3) litres/kg, p < 0.00001) than the mean of each of the three larger fractions and AHA, which were not different from each other (8.0 x 10(4) to 3.0 x 10(5) litres/kg). Jack Lake DOM had higher K-rp values than Luther Marsh, which predominantly contained lower molecular weight DOM. The generator column method produced more precise K-rp measurements between fenvalerate and DOM than the bottle method; however, the use of Sep-Paks to measure DOM association with hydrophobic chemicals which exhibit high breakthrough, such as fenvalerate, may produce questionable results.

Quality of soil organic matter determines the amount of DOM released from the topsoil if the soils have a low ability to adsorb and to precipitate DOM. Favorable conditions for high DOC concentrations in the soil solution are wide C/N ratios in the soil and in the hot water soluble fraction, a high soil content of hot water soluble organic carbon and a high portion of hot water soluble organic carbon in the total organic carbon content. Anthropogenic changes of the Soils are effective to DOM release via changing quality of soil organic matter. Long dry periods : and large water fluxes can further increase DOM release. The effects of soil organic matter can be disguised in soils with a high DOM retention capacity (high CEC, high content of exchangeable bases, Fe-ox and Fe-d). Then adsorption and precipitation determine DOM release from the topsoil and contribute;to a decrease of DOM release.

Therefore, we studied the correlation between the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the mobilization and transport of beta-HCH in two soil profiles used as grassland and in incubation experiments. From our results we conclude that beta-HCH was mobilized and transported to deeper soil horizons probably by coupling between beta-HCH and DOM. The interaction of beta-HCH with DOM as indicated by the measured high partition coefficient between beta-HCH and DOM (logK(DOC) = 4.39) was much higher than would be expected from the physicochemical properties of beta 4-HCH. As suggested from synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy data, the capacity of DOM to bind beta-HCH increases as the more extended aromatic regions of DOM are accessible in the aqueous extracts. The addition of lime and fresh organic matter to the grassland soils did not affect the measured coupling between beta-HCH and DOM. Long drying periods increased the coupling up to 9.9 mu g beta-HCH per mg DOC. Water-logging destroyed the binding between DOM and beta-HCH despite increasing DOC contents. Our main conclusion is that qualitative differences in DOM due to changed environmental conditions can drastically change the coupling of hydrophobic organic pollutants to DOM and greatly affect pollutant mobilization and translocation.

The RDEV technique has been used to estimate dissociation rate constants and diffusion coefficients; pseudopolarograms have indicated the identity of the metal complexes undergoing electrode reductions at the corresponding plateaus of the pseudopolarograms in a number of model solutions containing Cd or Pb and known amounts of fulvic acid. It has been found that the effect of dissolved organic material is measurable when the concentrations of fulvic acid are equal to or less than 20 mu g/mL (which is below the concentration of naturally occurring dissolved organic carbon in most fresh waters). The effective electrode surface area has been found to be considerably less man the geometric surface area, and if this fact is not explicitly taken into consideration, the result would be an erroneous estimation of dissociation rate constants and diffusion coefficients. Pseudopolarograms of aqueous samples containing Cd or Pb and fulvic acid and samples of Rideau river surface water clearly show that NCTMFEs effectively block the transport of large inert metal-FA complexes to the electrode surface, resulting in interference-free determination, and giving well-defined pseudopolarograms, and yet do not hinder the transport of small metal-FA complexes to the electrode surface. It is concluded that RDEV/ASV offers promise of being a valuable technique for determining chemical speciation of lead and cadmium in river surface waters.																	1040-0397					SEP	1997	9	13					1018	1029		10.1002/elan.1140091310						WOS:000071880500009		
J	Raber, B; KogelKnabner, I				Raber, B; KogelKnabner, I			Influence of origin and properties of dissolved organic matter on the partition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												We investigated dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soil, sewage sludges, water from waste disposal sites, and composts as sorbents and potential carriers for hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil. Partition coefficients (expressed log K-DOC) for two 5-ring compounds were 4.8-4.9 for DOM from soil, 4.5-4.7 from composts, and 4.3-4.4 from sewage sludges. The DOM from compost and sewage sludge can influence the transport of non-ionic organic contaminants because of the large concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) released from these materials. Leachates from waste disposal sites did not sorb PAHs. The DOM from compost contained a large percentage of organic molecules >14 000 Da (32-46%), whereas DOM from waste disposal leachates contained only 7-10%, and so bound less PAHs. The percentage of total hydrophobic components, as characterized by XAD-X chromatography, was 50 +/- 9% for most of the DOM solutions and did not express the differences in affinity of the organic sorbents to PAHs in the same way as the K-DOC values. Isolated molecular-weight fractions of DOM from composts sorbed benzo(k)fluoranthene in each fraction. The log K-DOC values were 4.1-4.3 for both fractions, < 1000 and 1000-14 000 Da, and 4.8-5.0 for the fraction > 14 000 Da. The interaction of PAHs with DOM < 1000 Da cannot be explained by partitioning within intramolecular nonpolar environments of dissolved macromolecules; rather it seems to be due to the amphoteric properties of DOM. This type of interaction of PAHs with small DOM molecules might affect the mobility of hydrophobic organic chemicals in soils.

J	McClain, ME; Richey, JE; Brandes, JA; Pimentel, TP				McClain, ME; Richey, JE; Brandes, JA; Pimentel, TP			Dissolved organic matter and terrestrial-lotic linkages in the central Amazon basin of Brazil	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												We evaluate the hypothesis that decomposition and adsorption reactions operating in upland soils of headwater catchments control the concentration and composition of dissolved and fine particulate organic matter in rivers of the Amazon basin. In two contrasting first-order catchments characteristic of the central Amazon basin, we analyzed plant, litter, soil, groundwater, and stream water chemistry. Our results indicate that clear and persistent differences exist in the concentration and elemental composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in stream waters and groundwaters from the two catchments, due mainly to corresponding differences in soil texture and chemistry. Within the more oxide and clay rich Oxisols underlying terra firme forest, groundwater DOM concentrations were uniformly low (120 mu MC) and C/N ratios averaged 10. Conversely, within the oxide and clay deficient Spodosols underlying campinarana forest, groundwater DOM concentrations were greatly elevated (3000 mu MC), and C/N ratios averaged near 60. We found that, in the terra firme/Oxisol terrain, the majority of DOM contributions to the stream derived from the riparian zone, while in the campinarana/Spodosol terrain, upland groundwater contributions could account for the concentration and composition of DOM in the stream. The implications of our findings are that in the terra firme terrains which dominate the region, upland soil profiles are not the site of definitive processes which impart compositional signatures to organic matter carried by the largest rivers of the Amazon basin, as was hypothesized. instead, we suggest that definitive reactions are focused primarily in the river corridor.

J	Moran, MA; Zepp, RG				Moran, MA; Zepp, RG			Role of photoreactions in the formation of biologically labile compounds from dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can be degraded by sunlight into a variety of photoproducts that stimulate the growth and activity of microorganisms in aquatic environments. All biologically labile photoproducts identified to date fall into one of four categories: (1) low-molecular-weight (MW) organic compounds (carbonyl compounds with MW of <200); (2) carbon gases (primarily CO); (3) unidentified bleached organic matter; and (4) nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich compounds (including NH4+ and PO43-). A number of laboratory studies using bacterial bioassay approaches have shown that the photochemical breakdown of DOM can stimulate biomass production or activity by 1.5- to 6-fold. Results of photochemical studies, extrapolated to estimate formation rates of biologically available photoproducts from DOM in surface waters, also predict important biological roles for these compounds. In a continental shelf system, for example, full exposure of surface seawater to sunlight for one summer day can produce DOM photodegradation products equivalent to >20% of the bacterial carbon demand. Likewise, 30% of the bacterial nitrogen demand can be met by photodegradation of the nitrogen components of DOM, a process likely to be of particular importance in nitrogen-limited systems. When considered on a depth-integrated basis around the globe, at least 1.0 x 10(15) g C and 0.15 x 10(15) g N are estimated to be available annually for utilization by planktonic microorganisms through the conversion of light-absorbing fractions of DOM to more biologically labile compounds. By comparison, direct photochemical mineralization of DOM is estimated to convert 12-16 x 10(15) g C to CO2 annually.

J	Miller, WL; Moran, MA				Miller, WL; Moran, MA			Interaction of photochemical and microbial processes in the degradation of refractory dissolved organic matter from a coastal marine environment	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The interaction between photochemical and biological processes in the degradation of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated with seawater from a coastal southeastern U.S. salt marsh. Seawater supplemented with humic substances was exposed to alternating cycles of sunlight (equivalent to 8 h of midday sun) and dark incubations with natural bacterial populations (1-2 weeks in length). Photochemical degradation of the DOM was monitored during sunlight exposure by direct measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbon monoxide (CO) formation in 0.2-mu m filtered seawater. Bacterial degradation was monitored during dark incubations by tritiated leucine uptake and changes in bacterial numbers in bacterivore-free incubations and by direct measurements of DOM loss. The alternating cycles of sunlight and microbial activity resulted in more complete degradation of bulk DOM and marine humic substances than was found for nonirradiated controls (i.e. with microbial activity alone) by a factor of up to 3-fold. Increased decomposition was due both to direct losses of carbon gas photoproducts (DIC and CO in a 15:1 ratio) and to enhanced microbial degradation of photodegraded DOM, with approximately equal contributions from each pathway. Mass balance calculations indicated that low-molecular-weight carbon photoproducts, currently considered to be the compounds responsible for stimulating bacterial activity following photodegradation of DOM, were insufficient to account for the enhanced bacterial production observed. Thus, higher molecular weight, chemically uncharacterized fractions of DOM may also be modified to more biologically available forms during exposure to natural sunlight.

J	Erich, MS; Trusty, GM				Erich, MS; Trusty, GM			Chemical characterization of dissolved organic matter released by limed and unlimed forest soil horizons	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Liming of forest soils, currently practiced in Europe, may be necessary in the future in North America to counteract calcium (Ca) depletion due to whole tree harvesting. With current concerns over increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere, the effects of forest practices such as liming on carbon (C) cycling in forest ecosystems has been receiving increasing attention. This laboratory study investigated the effect of an increase in pH on dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water extracts of organic horizons. Organic horizons were collected from nine forested sites, some predominantly hardwood and some predominantly softwood stand types. The soils were chemically characterized. Water extracts of limed and unlimed treatments of nine organic horizons were analyzed for pH, Al, Fe, Ca, C, and DOM negative charge density. Total luminescence fluorescence spectra were also obtained for each extract. The addition of lime (CaCO3) to organic horizons caused an average of 55% more C to be released than in unamended samples. Liming caused no significant changes in negative charge density of the DOM. Liming decreased organically-complexed aluminum (Al) and increased organically-complexed Ca. There was a negative correlation between Al concentration of extracts and fluorescence intensity. Chemical changes in the DOM released by liming were suggested by decreased fluorescence emission and excitation wavelengths due to liming. Hardwood samples did not respond differently than softwood samples with respect to DOM concentration, functional group concentration, or spectroscopic characteristics. However, there was a suggestion that particular tree species, such as cedar, may have unique effects on C concentrations and DOM chemistry.																	0008-4271					AUG	1997	77	3					405	413								WOS:A1997YC09500009		
J	Thomas, JD				Thomas, JD			The role of dissolved organic matter, particularly free amino acids and humic substances, in freshwater ecosystems	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Although the mass of dissolved organic matter (DOM) often exceeds that of living organisms in freshwaters, little is known about the roles of its constituent molecules as sources of energy and information for aquatic organisms. In the present review attention is focused on free amino acids (FAA) and humic substances (HS) as examples of labile and refractory components within DOM. 2. The following questions are addressed. (i) What are spatiotemporal patterns in the distribution of DOM, HS and FAA? (ii) What are the origins of the components of DOM and how are their concentrations regulated? (iii) What is the significance of the spatial and temporal distributional patterns of DOM, HS and FAA to detritivorous invertebrates and other organisms associated with them? (iv) What is the relevance of DOM to the food web concept and to the biochemical ecology of freshwater ecosystems? 3. Concentrations of DOM, FAA and HS within lentic ecosystems are ranked as follows: Sediment pore water > Air-water interface > Midwater column. Comparisons between water bodies show that the concentrations of labile constituents of DOM, such as FAA, are usually positively correlated with base cations, nutrients and biological activity. In contrast, HS concentrations are negatively correlated with base cations or nutrients but positively correlated with the rate of biological degradation (the maximum values occurring in the autumn). The FAA:HS ratios might serve therefore as an indicator of the potential productivity of a water body. 4. External sources of DOM in general, and FAA and HS in particular, include rainwater, windborne material, surface flow and groundwater. The relative importance of these allochthonous sources of DOM decreases along the length of lotic ecosystems and also with increase in size of lentis ecosystems. Internal sources of FAA and HS include synthesis or polymerization from existing organic matter, degradation of organic matter and release from both living and dead organisms. The net accumulation of DOM released by living bacteria, phytoplankton, epilithon, macrophytes and invertebrates is much reduced due to heterotrophic uptake. Hence, most of the allochthonous DOM in freshwater originates from dead organic matter deposited on the sediment. Phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems may, however, differ, as most of their DOM may be recycled within the water column. 5. The factors that determine the external concentrations of DOM, FAA and HS are discussed. Evidence is cited in support of the following testable hypotheses. (i) The rates of production of DOM components will be favoured by increasing base cation and nutrient concentrations. (ii) Colloidal clay, base cations, biopolymers and living organisms, particularly bacteria, facilitate the removal of HS. Consequently, base-rich eutrophic waters tend to have lower HS concentrations than oligotrophic, base-deficient waters. (iii) As a result of higher productivity and selective removal of FAA, eutrophic waters tend to have higher FAA concentrations than those that are oligotrophic. 6. Labile DOM components, such as FAA, act as sources of information for aquatic organisms. More research is needed in this field. There is a consensus that DOM acts as an important source of energy for aquatic bacteria, thus forming the microbial leap. However, higher eukaryotic organisms also utilize DOM, including components released by bacteria and plants as metabolic end-products and photoassimilates, respectively. As a result, these DOM components may be more important as food for macrodecomposers than the microdecomposers themselves, HS may also benefit aquatic organisms by promoting their growth and protecting them from inimical forces. Conversely, the removal of photons and the release of toxins by HS may be detrimental to aquatic organisms. 7. It is concluded that the central dogma of the foodweb, and its implicit assumption that the energy flow in aquatic ecosystems can be quantified solely by measuring rates of photosynthesis, ingestion of solid food and its digestion by higher organisms, is invalid. To extend our understanding of the role of DOM as a source of nutrition and information to aquatic organisms it is suggested that the subject should be studied within the context of 'modules' which have the following properties: (i) the components have co-evolved; (ii) the more vulnerable components will have protective mechanisms; (iii) the components will derive mutual benefits from co-existence; (iv) sedentary components will release kairomonal attractants or developmental primers; fv) living components will exchange energy and information; (vi) the module will collapse following the removal of strongly interactive keystone species. An example of a three-component, three-subset module, is provided by tubificid worms, epithilic bacteria and algae. A more complex module consisting of pulmonate snails, associated macrophytes, their epiphytic bacteria and algae has four components and six subsets. The elucidation of the interactive mechanisms within such modules demands an interdisciplinary approach, involving microbiology, biochemistry and behavioural biology.																	0046-5070					AUG	1997	38	1					1	36		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00206.x						WOS:A1997XR47300001		
J	Bianchi, TS; Lambert, CD; Santschi, PH; Guo, LD				Bianchi, TS; Lambert, CD; Santschi, PH; Guo, LD			Sources and transport of land-derived particulate and dissolved organic matter in the Gulf of Mexico (Texas shelf/slope): The use of lignin-phenols and loliolides as biomarkers	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The fate and transport of terrestrial organic matter across the continental margin in the Gulf of Mexico was studied in 1992 and 1993 using chemical biomarkers. Lignin-phenols were utilized as biomarkers for terrestrial inputs and indicated that much of the terrestrial organic matter inputs were deposited on the shelf/break and slope. The lignin-phenol concentrations (normalized to carbon) in POC, HMW DOC, and sediments in slope waters were considerably higher than at other open ocean sites studied previously. The dominant mechanism for transport of terrestrially-derived POC and HMW DOC across the shelf and slope was hypothesized to be advection of riverine and: estuarine discharges through benthic nepheloid layers. Based on loliolide concentrations in the water column, we believe that lateral transport of these materials at the shelf/break (through extensions of benthic nepheloid layers) may have been an important mechanism for the injection of terrestrially-derived organic matter into deep slope waters.

J	Wehr, JD; Lonergan, SP; Thorp, JH				Wehr, JD; Lonergan, SP; Thorp, JH			Concentrations and controls of dissolved organic matter in a constricted-channel region of the Ohio River	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												A 12-month study was conducted to measure the concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOG, TDN, TDP) in four sites within a 119 km long reach of the Ohio River, near Louisville, KY. In this study we test whether specific geomorphological and biological factors influenced variations in dissolved organic matter. Concentrations of DOC in the river averaged approximate to 1200 mu mol/L, and varied by nearly two orders of magnitude seasonally (mean DOC during base flow approximate to 620 mu mol/L). Peak periods for DOC at all sites were during April-May. The site nearest a navigation dam (deeper, lower current velocities) had significantly lower concentrations of TDN and greater C:N ratios than upstream sites. The largest tributary entering this reach (Kentucky River) had no significant effect on levels of DOM in the main river, despite having significantly greater concentrations of TDN and lower levels of DOC during most months of the year. Concentrations of DOC, TDN, and TDP were not significantly different in littoral and pelagic habitats at all sites studied, suggesting little floodplain influence on DOM in this constricted-channel section of the Ohio River. C:N ratios of DOM in the Ohio were significantly different among seasons; C:N exceeded or equaled Redfield ratios in summer and fall (6 to 10), but were below Redfield (1.8 to 3.0) during winter and spring. Regression models suggest that total phytoplankton densities and flow conditions are the two most important factors regulating DOM in this very large river.																	0168-2563					JUL	1997	38	1					41	65		10.1023/A:1005708326368						WOS:A1997XH84100003		
J	Totsche, KU; Danzer, J; KogelKnabner, I				Totsche, KU; Danzer, J; KogelKnabner, I			Dissolved organic matter-enhanced retention of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil miscible displacement experiments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) may alter the mobility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils. The influence of DOM on the mobility of PAHs was studied in medium-scale soil column experiments under unsaturated flow conditions. Miscible displacement experiments were carried out with PAHs alone (anthracene, pyrene, benzo(e)pyrene), with DOM alone, and with a mixture of the PAHs and DOM. Two different sandy materials were used, a spodic B horizon and a commercially available seasand. The DOM transport could be explained by assuming total DOM consisting of two physicochemically different fractions: A mobile fraction, composed of the hydrophilic moieties of DOM, and an immobile fraction, composed of hydrophobic DOM moieties. The PAH mobility in the column experiments was controlled by both solid and liquid phase organic matter. The PAH breakthrough in the absence of DOM was significantly retarded in both the seasand and the spodic B material. The observed breakthrough times were considerably lower than those estimated from calculations using published Kd values, that resulted in an overestimation of PAH mobility. The addition of DOM resulted in reduced mobility of PAHs and reduced PAH effluent concentration, but more so in the spodic B soil material than in the seasand. The reduced mobility of PAHs in the presence of DOM can be explained by sorption of DOM-associated PAHs to the bulk soil, that is, co-sorption. Alternatively, the continuous sorption of DOM by the bulk phase results in an increase or sorption capacity for free PAHs, which will also lead to PAH retardation (cumulative sorption).

Enzyme activities were compared with those of extracellular enzymes from ambient sediments. Enzyme activities ranged over five orders of magnitude, with averages decreasing in the order polychaetes > echinoderms > sediment. Highest activities in animals were usually associated with the fluid phase in midgut sections, with posteriorward decreases indicating little export to the external environment. At some phyletic levels, activity correlated inversely with animal size. Hydrolase patterns reflected food type; for example, high lipase:protease ratios in carnivores reflected esterified lipids in their diets. High surfactant activity was found in gut sections having high enzyme activity. Deposit feeders had the most intense surfactancy, including evidence for micelles. While enzymes reflected the biochemical nature of the digestible food substrate regardless of feeding mode (e.g., deposit vs. suspension feeder), surfactants reflected dilution of this digestible substrate with mineral grains. Disserved organic matter levels were high, with amino acids reaching levels > 1M and lipids commonly 1 g L-1. Among polychaete deposit-feeders, low molecular weight amino acids reflected the composition of the food substrate, but were present at much higher concentrations than could be explained by sediment present in the gut-suggesting longer residence times for fluid than for transiting sediment particles. Deposit feeder digestive fluids are better able to solubilize sedimentary food substrates than are sedimentary extracellular enzymes, owing to either more powerful solubilizing agents or to their deployment in freely diffusing, dissolved form. Gut environments may lead to chemical condensation as well as solubilization reactions.

In this study, we aimed to identify the chemical structures responsible for the retention of DOM by sorption experiments with total DOM and acidic humic substances (AHS), containing humic and fulvic acids, on soil samples and minerals (goethite, ferrihydrite, and amorphous Al(OH)(3)). The AHS remaining in solution after sorption were studied by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, and total DOM and AHS sorbed on the surfaces of minerals by diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The soil samples were taken from strongly sorbing Bw horizons of two Inceptisols rich in pedogenetic Fe (29 and 35 g kg(-1)) and containing little C (7 and 22 g kg(-1)). The C-13-NMR spectra showed that sorption causes a preferential removal of aromatic and carboxyl C from the solution, whereas alkyl-C accumulates in the solution. No change was observed for O-alkyl C. The DRIFT spectra of sorbed total DOM and AHS showed a relative increase of the band intensity of carboxyl groups compared to DOM in the initial solution, confirming the importance of those groups for the sorption to mineral surfaces. The spectra also indicated reactions of carboxyl groups with metals at the mineral surfaces. The extent to which the carboxyl groups are bound depended on the surface coverage with DOM and the type of mineral.

J	Sun, L; Perdue, EM; Meyer, JL; Weis, J				Sun, L; Perdue, EM; Meyer, JL; Weis, J			Use of elemental composition to predict bioavailability of dissolved organic matter in a Georgia river	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The relationship between the bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its bulk chemical composition was examined on three dates at 10 sites on the Ogeechee River, a blackwater river in Georgia. samples of riverine DOM were concentrated from filtered river water using reverse osmosis. In addition, particulate organic matter (POM), in the form of leaf litter, algae, and macrophytes, was leached with synthetic rainwater to obtain fresh DOM. Elemental composition, carboxylic acid content, and bacterial growth were measured on all samples. The results of this study indicate that fresh DOM in POM leachates is generally more bioavailable than riverine DOM. The bioavailability of riverine DOM appears to be greater under low discharge conditions and decreases with distance downstream. The bioavailability of all DOM samples is very well predicted (r(2) = 0.93, n = 20) by an empirical equation of the form: bioavailability = a(0) + a(1)(H:C) + a(2)(O:C) + a(3)(N:C). When compositional data are plotted on a van Krevelen diagram, it is evident that POM leachates and, to a lesser degree, DOM from headwater sires have compositions that differ little from simple mixtures of major components of biomass (lipids, sugars, proteins, and lignins). Father downstream, major diagenetic alteration of organic matter is evident from the compositions of DOM samples, whose H:C and O:C ratios are lower and higher, respectively, than for any possible mixture of biomass components. Bioavailability of DOM is closely related to the percentage of aliphatic carbon in a sample, and downstream decreases in bioavailability are mainly attributable to selective degradation of aliphatic carbon in riverine DOM.																	0024-3590					JUN	1997	42	4					714	721								WOS:000071037700009		
J	Kaiser, K; Zech, W				Kaiser, K; Zech, W			About the sorption of dissolved organic matter to forest soils	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENERNAHRUNG UND BODENKUNDE												This investigation characterizes the major forest soils of the temperate climatic zones (leptosols,vertisols, cambisols, luvisols; podzols, stagnosols, gleysols)as sorbents for dissolved organic matter (DOM). Sorption isotherms were obtained for 135 soil horizons from 36 profiles. When solutions containing no DOC were added, the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) was highest for horizons rich in organic C (A and Bh horizons). In subsoil horizons DOC release was much lower. Most of the investigated top soils (A and E horizons) and Bh, Bg, and C horizons showed a weak DOC sorption. This was caused by low contents of sorbents (clay and sesquioxides) and/or high contents of organic C. Organic C seems to reduce the DOC sorption by occupying binding sites. Subsoils rich in clay and sesquioxides like Bs, Bt, and Bw horizons showed a strong retention of DOG. Under the aerobic conditions of the experiments,some of the subsoils of stagnosols and gleysols also showed a strong sorption of DOG. However, in sorption experiments conducted after an anaerobic incubation, the DOC sorption decreased significantly.

Several techniques were used to quantify mucilage development by natural periphyton communities grown on glass fiber filters and on sand in a defined culture medium with and without exposure to humic acid fractions of the leachate (up to 20 mg C L-1): (a) direct examination by cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), (b) application of a cationic copper-containing dye, Alcian Blue 8GX, which binds to the glycosaminoglycans in the mucilage, and determination of the relative quantity of copper retained by the community by energy dispersive X-ray microanalyses, and (c) amounts of dye removed from solution by spectrophotometric analyses. Multiple experiments showed that DOG-treated communities contained 10 to 57 % less mucilage than untreated controls, and suggested that DOC in littoral and wetland environments can act as an important physical determinant of structural and metabolic attributes of periphyton.																	0003-9136					MAY	1997	139	3					289	299								WOS:A1997XH62200001		
J	Thomas, JD; Kowalczyk, C				Thomas, JD; Kowalczyk, C			Utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), from living macrophytes, by pulmonate snails: Implications to the ''food web'' and ''module'' concepts	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-PHYSIOLOGY												The rates at which freshwater macrophytes (axenic and nonaxenic Lemna minor L. and nonaxenic Ceratophyllum demersum L.) accumulated inorganic carbon (IC) into plant organic carbon (PLOC) and then released it as dissolved organic carbon (DCC) and fine particulate organic carbon (FPOC) were measured by incubating the plants in media containing C-14-labelled inorganic carbon (IC = CO2 + HCO3-). Both the rate of fixation of C-14 and the rate of loss of PLO(14)C were higher in the case of the faster growing Lemna than for Ceratophyllum. The fraction of the C-14 fixed by nonaxenic Lemna and Ceratophyllum and then released as (DOC)-C-14 increased significantly with time to give values of 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively, after 9 days' incubation. There were no significant differences between the rates of release of (DOC)-C-14 by axenic and nonaxenic Lemna but nonaxenic Lemna released significantly more of the fixed C-14 as (FPOC)-C-14 (1%) than axenic Lemna (0.1%). Nonaxenic Ceratophyllum released significantly more (FPOC)-C-14 (8.2%) than Lemna (0.9%) after 9 days of conditioning. Some of the C-14 in the (DOC)-C-14 accumulated as carboxylic acids (C-6, C-7 C-16, C-18) in the surface film. Living adult snails incubated for 38 hr in (DOC)-C-14, from nonaxenic Lemna, accumulated significantly more of the C-14 in their body tissues, haemolymph and shell (9.5%, 6.3%, 0.4% of the total carbon, respectively; concentration factor 10-15) than control snails. Snails incubated in media with (DOC)-C-14 from axenic Lemna accumulated proportionately less of the C-14 label and produced more respiratory CO2 than snails incubated in media from nonaxenic Lemna. The results are discussed with particular reference to the food web and modular concepts.

J	Biddanda, B; Benner, R				Biddanda, B; Benner, R			Carbon, nitrogen, and carbohydrate fluxes during the production of particulate and dissolved organic matter by marine phytoplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Although the principal source of marine organic matter is phytoplankton, experimental data on carbon and nitrogen mass balance during their growth cycle are lacking. Phytoplankton from diverse taxonomic groups (Synechococcus bacillaris, Phaeocystis sp., Emiliania huxleyi, Skeletonema costatum) were grown in synthetic seawater media, and changes in particulate and dissolved carbon, nitrogen, and carbohydrates were followed for 14 d. There was a close molar balance between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) uptake and total organic carbon (TOC) production in all phytoplankton except Emiliania, which synthesizes carbonate-containing coccoliths. Rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production during phytoplankton growth ranged from 5 to 13 mu M DOC d(-1) (0.01-0.06 pmol DOC pM cell C-1 d(-1)) and constituted a substantial (10-32%) fraction of TOC production. The carbohydrate content of both the particulate and dissolved pools increased over the growth cycle and constituted 18-45% and 26-80% of TOC, respectively. The dissolved carbohydrate pool was predominantly composed of poly saccharides (70-94%). Despite some species-specific variability, phytoplankton cellular (particulate) and extracellular (dissolved) organic matter C:N ratios did not deviate far from Redfield values. However, phytoplankton synthesized compositionally distinct peals of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (>1,000 Da, average C:N ratio similar to 21) and low molecular weight dissolved organic matter (<1,000 Da, average C:N ratio similar to 6.0).

J	Dosskey, MG; Bertsch, PM				Dosskey, MG; Bertsch, PM			Transport of dissolved organic matter through a sandy forest soil	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												We assessed the transport of dissolved organic matter (DOM) through a sandy, Ultisol forest soil on the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain, and contrasted the results with similar studies from other forest regions, to test the hypothesis that DOM transport is greater through sandy Ultisols than finer textured Ultisols and Spodosols. Within a small headwater catchment, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG), a measure of DOM, were measured in soil solution at three depths (10, 30, and 90 cm) in sand A and E horizons of soil profiles, and in sand along the valley bottom at 198- to 264-cm depth in shallow groundwater. Water samples were collected after every rainfall event for 21 mo using zero-tension lysimeters, suction samplers, and piezometers. Mean concentration of DOC in soil water decreased from 25.5 mg C L-1 at 10-cm depth to 13.7 mg C L-1 at 30 cm, and to 1.8 mg C L-1 at 76 to 99 cm, before contacting clay-enriched horizons. All valley bottom stations consistently averaged between 0.3 and 2.1 mg C L-1. We did not find significant seasonal patterns, nor a correlation between DOC concentration and magnitude of rainfall events. We estimate that the nux of DOC decreased more sharply with soil depth than concentration due to attenuation of water transport through the soil profile. Compared with literature data from other forest regions, our results do not support the hypothesis that there is greater DOM transport through sandy upland soils on the Coastal Plain. Our results suggest that this is due to strong DOM retention within deep sand E horizons of these soils. Thus, strong DOM retention in forest soils appears to occur across a broader range of soil types than those exhibiting podzolization or having high clay content.																	0361-5995					MAY-JUN	1997	61	3					920	927								WOS:A1997XC99600030		
J	Opsahl, S; Benner, R				Opsahl, S; Benner, R			Distribution and cycling of terrigenous dissolved organic matter in the ocean	NATURE												Terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) is continuously discharged by rivers into the ocean, yet its distribution and reactivity within ocean basins remain poorly defined aspects of the global carbon cycle(1). Direct evidence for the presence of terrigenous DOM in the open ocean has been found only in dissolved humic substances isolated from surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean(2), Here we report the detection of low concentrations of Lignin-a biopolymer found only in terrestrial vegetation-in DOM collected from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, indicating that terrigenous DOM is distributed throughout the ocean water column. Higher lignin concentrations in Atlantic waters, relative to Pacific waters, reflect terrigenous DOM concentrations that are 2.6 times higher in the Atlantic. This finding is consistent with the 3.6-times greater riverine water-discharge to the Atlantic Ocean(3,4), and with known patterns of ocean circulation(5), It appears that terrigenous DOM comprises only a small fraction (0.7-2.4%) of the total DOM in the ocean, and that its oceanic residence time (21-132 yr) is much shorter than that of marine DOM(6,7). The regeneration of nutrients during rapid cycling of terrigenous DOM could contribute to high rates of primary production in the coastal ocean.

J	Hopkinson, CS; Fry, B; Nolin, AL				Hopkinson, CS; Fry, B; Nolin, AL			Stoichiometry of dissolved organic matter dynamics on the continental shelf of the northeastern USA	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), phosphorus (DOP), inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphorus were measured from the Georges Bank region during spring 1993 and summer 1994. Concentrations of DOC in surface waters ranged from 65-92 mu M C and decreased with depth to about 50 mu M in shelf slope water at a depth of 1500 m. DON and DOP concentrations showed a similar pattern with depth, being higher in surface water and lower in deep water (similar to 5 to 3 mu M N and 0.17 to 0.02 mu M P). There was an inverse relation between inorganic nutrient concentrations and DON and DOP. While DOC concentrations were elevated in regions of highest primary production, there was little evidence of corresponding elevations for DON and DOP. Slopes of regression lines relating total disserved N and P to inorganic N and P indicated that 19 and 15% of remineralized N and P that accumulates in deeper water is derived from the export and decomposition of dissolved organic material (DOM). While overall inorganic N and P dynamics followed Redfield, A. C. (1958) (American Scientist, 46, 205-221) stoichiometry (C:N:P, 106:16:1), the C:N:P stoichiometry of dissolved organic matter deviated substantially. Near-surface stoichiometry of DOM was 400-800:1 for DOC:DOP, 11-15:3 for DOC:DON and 24-55:1 for DON:DOP. Relationships between DOG, DON and DOP indicated that N and P were preferentially remineralized relative to carbon resulting in C:N:P ratios for deeper water DOM that deviated even further from Redfield. Decomposition studies revealed that DOC decomposition rate was related to initial DOC concentration. The higher the DOC concentration the more quickly it was mineralized. DOC first order decay coefficients ranged from undetectable for deep slope water with an initial DOC concentration of 50 mu M to 0.0024 day(-1) for water collected from the Georges Bank shoals with an initial DOC concentration of 92 mu M. DON and DOP decomposition occurred concomitantly with DOC remineralization. Loss rates ranged from undetectable to 0.00064 day(-1) for DON and from undetectable to 0.0023 day(-1) for DOP. During DOM decomposition we noted increases in the C:N, C:P and N:P ratios, which indicated preferential remineralization of N and P relative to C. Vertical concentration gradients and slow DOM turnover times relative to water residence times in the Georges Bank continental shelf region indicate the potential for export of DOM to deeper water. DOM export to depth and preferential remineralization of N and P relative to C may be important mechanisms for pumping C to depth in the ocean.

J	Temminghoff, EJM; VanderZee, SEATM; deHaan, FAM				Temminghoff, EJM; VanderZee, SEATM; deHaan, FAM			Copper mobility in a copper-contaminated sandy soil as affected by pH and solid and dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The effects of solid, dissolved organic matter and of pH on copper mobility in a copper-contaminated sandy soil has been studied in the laboratory as well as in the field. The soil, with pH ranging from 3.8 to 5.7, had been polluted with copper in the range from 0.13 to 1.9 mmol/kg more than 1 decade ago. Copper bound by dissolved organic matter (purified humic acid) was determined by a Cu ion selective electrode (Cu-ISE) in a pH range from 4 to 8 and a free copper range from 10(-4) to 10(-12) mol/L. Column experiments were carried out to investigate the mobility of DOC itself and the effect of DOC on Cu mobility. Copper binding by dissolved organic matter (DOG) as well as copper binding by (soil) solid organic matter (SOC) could be described well with the non-ideal competitive adsorption (NICA) model and with the Two Species Freundlich (TSF) model. Both models could be used to predict the copper concentration at different depths in a field using the total Cu content pH, and solid and dissolved organic matter content. At pH 3.9 about 30% of the Cu in solution was copper bound by DOG, and at pH 6.6 CuDOC comprised more than 99%. DOC mobility was very sensitive to pH and calcium concentration.																	0013-936X					APR	1997	31	4					1109	1115		10.1021/es9606236						WOS:A1997WR54600049		
J	Hollis, L; Muench, L; Playle, RC				Hollis, L; Muench, L; Playle, RC			Influence of dissolved organic matter on copper binding, and calcium on cadmium binding, by gills of rainbow trout	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Complexation of Cu by 5 mg C l(-1) dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a marsh kept Cu from binding to gills of small rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in 9-day exposures to 0.5 mu m Cu in soft water. The protective effect of DOM occurs because the formation of Cu-DOM complexes reduces the amount of free Cu in the water, so the disruptive effects of Cu on ionoregulation, such as inhibited Na uptake, cannot develop. The Cu-DOM complexes themselves do not bind to the gills. Calcium (1100 mu M) reduced the accumulation of Cd by trout gills in short, 2-h exposures through competition for gill binding sites but not over longer, 7-day exposures to 0.14 mu M Cd. However, the protective effect of Ca against Cd toxicity persisted throughout the longer experiment, likely due to the decrease in the electrochemical gradient for diffusive loss of Ca from the fish to the water. Rainbow trout and fathead minnows Pimephales promelas accumulated Cu and Cd on their gills in a similar manner; thus, binding constants for metal-gill interactions determined for one species of fish can be generalized to other fish species. When literature binding constants determined for fathead minnows were applied to our studies with rainbow trout, computer modelling of Cu-gill and Cu-DOM interactions simulated our results well. In contrast Cd-gill and Ca-gill modelling predicted the initial competitive effect of Ca against Cd accumulation by trout gills, but did not predict the longer-term accumulation of Cd by trout gills.

J	Zuo, YG; Jones, RD				Zuo, YG; Jones, RD			Photochemistry of natural dissolved organic matter in lake and wetland waters - Production of carbon monoxide	WATER RESEARCH												The photochemical formation of carbon monoxide (CO) in various lake and wetland waters was found to be correlated with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as light absorbance and fluorescence of the waters, suggesting that dissolved organic matter is a major precursor for CO photoproduction. Rates of CO formation also increased nonlinearly with increasing concentration of dissolved iron. For the lake and wetland waters studied, CO production rates were between 13 and 910 nmol l(-1) h(-1) using June solar noon sunlight irradiations. Field experiments in a subtropical pond demonstrated that much of photochemically formed CO in the surface water was effluxed to the atmosphere. Considering the globally-averaged effective sunlight flux, we estimate that photoformation of CO leads to a turnover time of 2-10 yr for DOC in sunlit surface waters.

J	Hinedi, ZR; Chang, AC; Borchardt, DB				Hinedi, ZR; Chang, AC; Borchardt, DB			Probing the association of fluorobenzene with dissolved organic matter using NMR spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												We dissolved and fractionated the commercially available Aldrich humic acid (AHA) into less than 1000 and less than 8000 atomic mass unit (amu) fractions and used H-1 NMR to analyze the chemical forms of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of these two AHA fractions in D2O. The range of linewidths of the signals observed in the H-1 NMR spectra of the different molecular mass fractions suggests that DOM in the AHA solutions are mixtures of organic molecules of different molecular sizes. The spectrum of the less than 8000 amu AHA solution exhibited boarder linewidths and more pronounced aromatic character than the less than 1000 amu AHA solution. The association of DOM in these two AHA fractions and fluorobenzene (C6H5F) in D2O solutions as indicated by the translational mobility (self-diffusion) of fluorobenzene was examined using F-19 pulsed field gradient spin echo NMR. One fraction of the C6H5F molecules was found to have a diffusion coefficient comparable to that of fluorobenzene dissolved in AHA-free D2O and was assigned to the unbound Ca6H5F. The remainder, fluorobenzene, has a self-diffusion coefficient considerably smaller than that in AHA-free D2O and was assigned to the DOM-bound fractions. The magnitude of the self-diffusion coefficients of AHA-bound C6H5F decreases with increase in amu of the AHA fractions, suggesting sorption as a mechanism of C6H5F-DOM association.

Fluorescence spectra were spectrally corrected against a reference standard and normalized to the water Raman signal to provide results in Raman units. Because CDOM originates mainly from freshwater river runoff in the St. Lawrence system, its optical properties were found to be inversely correlated with salinity (r = -0.95) and sigma-t (r = -0.99). These strong linear relationships can be used as a tool for monitoring surface circulation and salinity in these coastal waters. The relationships between CDOM absorption and fluorescence were also characterized in the UV and visible regions. In the UV region, the observed relationship was found to be consistent with previously published results. In the visible region a relationship was found that was different from that in the UV. Our results therefore support the possibility of using fluorescence characteristics for extensive monitoring of CDOM in coastal waters strongly influenced by freshwater runoff. Such relationships may prove useful for remote sensing to correct chi a values and the large-scale modelling of primary production in coastal waters.

J	HunchakKariouk, K; Schweitzer, L; Suffet, IH				HunchakKariouk, K; Schweitzer, L; Suffet, IH			Partitioning of 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl by the dissolved organic matter in oxic and anoxic porewaters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Until recently, the dissolved organic matter(DOM) of pore waters was an overlooked pool of organic matter important to the fate and transport of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs). The aqueous solubility enhancement and the porewater DOM partition coefficient (K-PWDOM) Of 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TeCB) were compared in samples of anoxic porewater and that same porewater after aeration. Aeration of anoxic porewater increased TeCB partitioning by porewater DOM. Despite a decrease in DOM concentration (coagulated by precipitated iron(III) oxidized during porewater aeration), oxic (aerated) porewaters had greater solubility enhancement and up to an order of magnitude larger K-PWDOM than anoxic (unaltered) porewaters. Anoxic porewaters with no detectable dissolved oxygen and 45 mg/L dissolved iron(II) had the smallest TeCB solubility enhancement and K-PWDOM Using experimentally determined K-PWDOM values, a three-phase equilibrium-partitioning model predicts the following: (1) the distribution of HOC freely dissolved and associated with porewater DOM will change when anoxic sediments are aerated; (2) HOC mobility will increase with anoxic sediment aeration because HOC concentration in the aquatic phase will increase; and (3) HOC bioavailability will be less in anoxic porewaters as compared to oxic systems because a smaller concentration of HOC will be freely dissolved.																	0013-936X					MAR	1997	31	3					639	645		10.1021/es9600542						WOS:A1997WK81500030

J	Johnson, MD; Ward, AK				Johnson, MD; Ward, AK			Influence of phagotrophic protistan bacterivory in determining the fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a wetland microbial food web	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												A field study over an annual cycle in a shallow, wetland pond dominated by Nymphaea odorata was combined with laboratory experiments to determine the fate of DOM from aquatic macrophyte primary productivity in the microbial food web. DOM concentrations, bacterial abundance and productivity, and protistan abundance were more than an order of magnitude higher during warm months (water temperatures >20 degrees C) than during cool months (<20 degrees C). Out-of-phase oscillations between microbial populations suggested protistan bacterivore grazing pressure affected bacterial abundance during the warm months. Microcosm experiments designed to mimic warm-month conditions using wetland pond microbial communities showed similar rates of macrophyte leachate uptake by both grazed and ungrazed bacteria. However, in the presence of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, bacterial biomass accumulation was less than one-half of that in treatments without bacterivores, and calculated carbon mineralization was fivefold greater in the treatment with bacterivores. No difference in amounts of NH4-N between treatments was detected, nor were decreased rates of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) different between experimental treatments. Experimental results indicated uptake of DOM from N. odorata by aquatic bacteria was rapid and could support the microbial food web in this system. However, grazing of bacterioplankton by nanoflagellates under experimental conditions did not result in significant increases in protistan biomass. The majority of bacterial productivity was respired in the presence of grazers rather than being incorporated into grazer biomass.																	0095-3628					MAR-APR	1997	33	2					149	162		10.1007/s002489900017						WOS:A1997WL74000007		
J	MartinMousset, B; Croue, JP; Lefebvre, E; Legube, B				MartinMousset, B; Croue, JP; Lefebvre, E; Legube, B			Distribution and characterization of dissolved organic matter of surface waters	WATER RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) of various river and reservoir waters. The determination of the ''hydrophobic/hydrophiric DOM distribution'' was used in parallel with more related drinking water parameters to compare the selected waters (i.e. chlorine and ozone reactivity). The ''hydrophobic/hydrophilic DOM distribution'' also called ''humic/non-humic NOM distribution'' of eight natural surface waters, four reservoir waters and four river waters, was determined by fractionating the organic matrix into three fractions onto two superposed XAD-8 and XAD-4 resin columns at acidic pH, the hydrophobic substances (i.e. humic substances) that adsorbed onto the XAD-I resin, the hydrophilic acids that adsorbed onto the XAD-4 resin, and the non-adsorbed hydrophilic solutes that are contained into the XAD-4 effluent. The ''hydrophobic/hydrophiIic DOM distribution'' was determined based on DOC or UV-254 nm measurements. The structural characterization of the NOM was completed by the determination of its biodegradable disserved organic carbon (BDOC) content and its apparent molecular weight distribution using a 1000 dalton cutoff ultrafiltration membrane. Batch ozonation and chlorination were conducted on the various surface waters to compare their ozone demand and chlorine reactivity (chlorine demand, TTHM and TOX formation potentials). The waters collected from the reservoirs were found to be richer in DOC (6.8-7.8 mg l(-1)) and showed higher UV-254nm absorbance values (0.22-0.29cm(-1)) than the waters sampled from the rivers (2.8-5.3 mg l(-1) of DOG, UV-254 nm absorbance ranged from 0.057 to 0.15 cm(-1)). Whatever the origin of the water, the higher the DOG, the higher the UV absorbance. However, a better correlation was obtained between these two parameters when considering the two groups of waters separately. The ''hydrophobic/hydrophilic DOM distribution'' showed that the DOC of both reservoir and river waters was evenly split between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic fractions. Nevertheless, the hydrophobic fraction (i.e. humic substances) was found to be proportionally more abundant in reservoir waters (51-62% of the DOG) than in river waters (41-50% of DOG). This observation correlates well with the fact that the relative UV absorbance (also called specific UV absorbance: UV Abs.1/mg C) of the studied reservoir waters was generally higher than the relative UV absorbance of the studied river waters, since humic substances are known to be the most aromatic NOM fraction. On the contrary, data have also shown that the non-adsorbed hydrophilic fraction was significantly more abundant in rivers (23-26% of the DOG) than in reservoirs (14-21% of the DOG). One can note that the hydrophilic acids represent a pseudo constant fraction whatever the origin of the water (24-28% for seven of the eight surface waters). The presence of suspended sediments in rivers may explain the predominance of hydrophilic substances for this group of surface waters because of possible interactions (adsorption properties) between suspended materials and humic substances (hydrophobic organic fraction). The Loire river which corresponds to the largest river we have studied (rich in suspended sediments) was characterized by the lowest hydrophobic organic content, 40% of the DOG, a proportion that is similar to the ones previously observed by Semmens and Staples (1986) and Collins et al. (1986) for the Mississippi river and the Colorado river, respectively. Using a 1000 dalton ultrafiltration membrane no significant difference was observed between the apparent molecular weight distribution of the DOC of both river and reservoir waters. Organics above l000 daltons generally accounted for up to 70-80% of the DOG. Results obtained with the Loire river were significantly different showing 50% of the DOC below 1000 daltons as compared to 20-30% for the other waters. These data are of particular interest because, according to the XAD-8/XAD-4 I isolation procedure, the more hydrophilic the NOM, the lower its apparent molecular weight. One could note that the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) accounted for approximately 15% of the DOC of the studied waters. If one could expect that higher the hydrophilic organic content, the higher the BDOC content, no significant correlation was established between these two parameters. Reservoir waters were found to be more reactive with chlorine and ozone than river waters. The higher the UV-Abs or DOC of the water, the higher the ozone demand, chlorine demand, TOXFP, and THMFP. A reasonably good correlation was obtained between the ozone demand and chlorine demand. Regarding the DPB formation potentials, TTHMFP accounted for approximately 25% of TOXFP. Taking into account the DOC content of the different waters, the relative TTHMFP and TOXFP (mu g Cl mg(-1) C) were determined to be generally (with few exceptions) higher for the reservoir waters than for the river waters. However, no direct correlation between the hydrophobic organic content (i.e, humic substances content) and the DPB formation potentials could be established. Indeed, results of our previous works (Croue et al., 1993b) have shown that THMFP and TOXFP of hydrophilic acids and fulvic acids (90% of the humic substances) were similar.

Simultaneous in situ measurements of Chi a, light attenuation, light scattering, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) or dissolved Mn collected along with CTD information provided new insight into the effects of mixing and non-conservative processes on riverine input to the coastal ocean. Inter-relationships among these parameters proved to be effective at delineating three coastal water masses: Columbia River Plume Water (CRPW), Shelf Deep Water (SDW), and Shelf Bottom Water (SEW). CRPW had variable amounts of FDOM, dissolved Mn, and Chi a as the plume mixed with coastal water. SEW was characterized by high concentrations of Chi a and low concentrations of dissolved Mn, suggesting a surface or near-surface source. The properties of SDW were intermediate between humic-rich plume water and turbid bottom water. FDOM displayed a quasi-linear and inverse relationship with salinity inside the estuary and nearshore coastal plume which supports previous work relating this parameter to the humic-rich terrestrial component of dissolved organic matter (DOM). There was, however, considerable evidence of lower FDOM levels within the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) and near the seaward boundary of the plume. There were also elevated levels of FDOM near the bottom at some locations on the shelf, suggesting that there may be a significant benthic flux of this material. Thus FDOM appears to be more reactive than previously thought when looked at in detail. Dissolved Mn also displayed non-conservative behavior in the estuary and across the plume showing significant input into surface waters. The sharpest Mn gradient on the shelf occurred near the seaward edge of the plume in an area of relatively high turbidity and Chi a, and relatively low FDOM. These distributions are consistent with the presence of a chemical front near the plume boundary where Mn-oxides are reduced during the oxidation of humic ligands. This process would release dissolved Mn and promote productivity in the turbid zone associated with the leading edge of the plume jet. This study demonstrates that chemical sensors can provide highly resolved, detailed information on trace substance distribution and variability in marine environments.

J	Curtis, PJ; Schindler, DW				Curtis, PJ; Schindler, DW			Hydrologic control of dissolved organic matter in low-order Precambrian Shield Lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and color were measured as a function of time in enclosures and lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area, to calculate their net loss rates. Loss rates in enclosures were first order for both DOC and color, with half-times for loss of 166 and 122 d, respectively. Thus, the colored, light-attenuating component of the DOC pool is lost from water more rapidly than is bulk DOG. Loss rates in lakes, calculated from a steady state model, were similar to values for color in enclosures, but for DOC in lakes were four times slower than in enclosures. In lakes, loss rate for DOC increased rapidly with decreasing water residence time (tau(w)) but was independent of tau(w) when it was greater than 3 years. In lakes, the loss rate for color was independent of water residence time. The difference in losses of DOC and color between lakes and enclosures could be from release of low-color DOC from sediments.

J	Raastad, IA; Ogner, G				Raastad, IA; Ogner, G			Efficiency of diethylaminoethyl cellulose in the isolation of dissolved organic matter from forest soil solutions	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE cellulose), a weak anion exchange resin, has been used to isolate dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soil solutions collected from three different soil types, to investigate the amount of DOM isolated from soil solutions of various origin, and the extent to which inorganic ions are isolated together with DOM. The concentration of DOM in the various soil solutions ranged from 2.5 to 32.8 mg.L-1 DOC. More than 80% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was usually isolated with DEAE cellulose. High concentrations of aluminum (Al) and sulfate (SO42-) in the soil solutions have reduced DOC recovery. More than 90% of potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+), were removed during the isolation procedure, but 10 to 20% of Al and 30 to 40% of iron (Fe) were isolated together with the DOC, probably due to strong complexation to DOM. The advantages of using DEAE cellulose were that the use of strong acids and bases was limited and that pH adjustments of the sample, leading to chemical modification of DOM, was not required.																	0010-3624						1997	28	15-16					1311	1321		10.1080/00103629709369876						WOS:A1997XX33900005		
J	Kahler, P; Bjornsen, PK; Lochte, K; Antia, A				Kahler, P; Bjornsen, PK; Lochte, K; Antia, A			Dissolved organic matter and its utilization by bacteria during spring in the Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) were measured during early austral Spring 1992 at a number of stations along the 6 degrees W meridian between 47 degrees and 60 degrees S. This included the Polar Front in the north, the zone of melting sea-ice in the south, and waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in between. Concentrations of DOC were low in deep water (34-38 mu M) With generally similar or slightly higher values in the surface mixed layer (38-55 mu M). DOC:DON ratios are wider in surface water than in deep water, i.e. surface accumulations contain relatively C-rich dissolved organic matter. The highly variable distribution of the surface DOC was not related to hydrographic or biotic features (fronts, plankton development) indicating the lability and transient occurrence of this material. Growth rates of bacteria were determined in subsamples from 51 0.8-mu m-filtered batches of seawater incubated in the dark at in-situ temperature. Thymidine and leucine uptake and bacterial biomass change as well as changes in dissolved organic carbon in the batches, and oxygen consumption in parallel incubations correlated linearly over 2 weeks of incubation which allowed extrapolation to in-situ conditions. Bacterial growth in these experiments depended strongly on the amount of initial DOG. Growth in water from greater depth (1000 m) containing 38 mu M DOG was minimal, as were DOG-decrease and oxygen consumption. Higher rates were observed in surface water slightly enriched with DOG, and highest rates in surface water amended with DOG-rich melted sea ice. Bacterial growth efficiencies (biomass C-increase vs DOC consumed) were about 30%. The experiments showed that at least 40-60% of the DOC in excess of deep water concentrations was available to bacteria.

To assess the contribution of heterotrophic processes, we examined bacterial production and the uptake of specific components of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool during a trans-Arctic expedition. Bacterial production generally covaried with phytoplankton production and bacterial numbers; the highest Values of all three parameters were in the more open waters of the Chukchi Sea and they were generally lower at the other stations which were covered by ice. Although bacterial production correlated with phytoplankton production, the ratio of bacterial to phytoplankton production (BP:PP) varied substantially. It was lowest (BP:PP < 0.1) at stations with some open water and highest at ice-covered stations, sometimes exceeding I,depending on how bacterial production was measured. These high BP:PP ratios imply that bacterial respiration and DOM fluxes are large. This bacterial activity could be accounted for by the uptake of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) and glucose. Uptake of these DOM components was high because of rapid turnover and high concentrations, especially of DFAA. Concentrations of dissolved combined neutral carbohydrates (e.g. polysaccharides) were often also high compared to other environments. These data indicate that heterotrophic bacteria and the rest of the microbial loop are large and active components of the biological community in the Arctic Ocean in spite of perennially law temperatures.

J	Brunk, BK; Jirka, GH; Lion, LW				Brunk, BK; Jirka, GH; Lion, LW			Effects of salinity changes and the formation of dissolved organic matter coatings on the sorption of phenanthrene: Implications for pollutant trapping in estuaries	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Estuaries have been reported to be sinks far hydrophobic pollutants, and sorption has been commonly attributed to be an important mechanism responsible for the observed pollutant trapping. The sorption enhancement caused by ''salt effects'' and dissolved organic matter (DOM) coatings were both measured and modeled, and the results were used to probe the extent to which equilibrium sorption could explain estuarine pollutant trapping. The polycyclic aromatic compound phenanthrene, an extracellular polymer from a soil bacterial isolate, and a low organic carbon kaolinite were used as models for the hydrophobic pollutant, DOM, and suspended sediment, respectively. Sorptive interactions between phenanthrene, extracellular polymer, and kaolinite were measured at pH 8 as a function of salinity. The experimentally determined binary distribution coefficients were combined using a three-component sorption model to calculate the overall sorption coefficient for phenanthrene, K-0. Increasing the ionic strength to seawater levels increased the overall sorption coefficient by 55% as compared to the freshwater Value while the presence of polymer coatings increased K-0 by 9% at all salinities. The three-component model simulation of sorption in the estuary showed that only 0.1% of available phenanthrene would be sorbed to suspended sediment given reasonable estimates of the DOM and particulate concentrations. Order of magnitude analyses carried out with other combinations of estuarine DOM and sediments also fell short of levels required to explain observed estuarine pollutant trapping. These experiments and model simulations lead to the conclusion that equilibrium sorption of phenanthrene cannot explain the full extent of pollutant trapping in estuaries.																	0013-936X					JAN	1997	31	1					119	125		10.1021/es9602051						WOS:A1997WC40000036

To evaluate potential effects of DOM, the kinetics of naphthalene desorption from soil and mineralization in soil solution in the presence of DOM were studied in completely mixed batch reactors (CMBRs). Three different DOM solutions were studied. The desorption rate or equilibrium partitioning of naphthalene was not affected by the presence of varying DOM solutions. The effect on mineralization was evaluated based on a evaluation of a first-order rate constant extracted by non-linear regression of data fitted to a (CO2)-C-14 production model. For the Muck DOM solution, Alfalfa DOM solution, and Fulvic Acid DOM solution, first order rate constants were 0.0474, 0.0657, 0.0422 min(-1), respectively. Uncertainty analysis of the data suggested that no significant differences in first-order rate constants were observed at a 90% confidence level. Although not apparent in this study, the DOM impact on the mechanisms of desorption and biodegradation in a plant -soil environment may need to be addressed with the increased interest in phytoremediation and land farming as means of treating organic contaminants.																			1-57477-031-4				1997	4(3)	3					361	366								WOS:A1997BH89U00095

J	Ohno, T; Cronan, CS				Ohno, T; Cronan, CS			Comparative effects of ionic- and nonionic-resin purification treatments on the chemistry of dissolved organic matter	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The effect of purification using ionic and non-ionic resin chromatography on the charge density and fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was evaluated. Aqueous extracts of a forest soil O horizon and field corn residue were used to represent DOM from a well humified DOM source and the initial reactants for DOM formation in agricultural soils. Treatments included purification with a H+-saturated cation exchange resin (CAT), H+ + OH--saturated mixed bed resin (MBR), and serial columns of XAD-8 and XAD-4 resins (XAD). In general, the alteration of DOM characteristics by purification was less for the O horizon DOM than for the corn residue DOM. The commonly used CAT purification did not alter the chemical properties measured in this study for the O horizon DOM. The CAT purification did result in a 15% loss of carbon content for corn residue DOM, but caused no difference in charge density. The benefits of MBR purification in removing both inorganic cations and anions are offset by decreased DOM recovery and charge density, especially for the corn residue extract. The use of XAD purification significantly favors a DOM fraction with a higher charge density than in the control (CTL) extract. The pragmatic need to concentrate DOM in natural solutions with low dissolved organic carbon concentration may favor the use of a XAD treatment. Careful evaluation of how purification affects the chemical characteristics of the DOM is required, especially with plant-derived materials, to ensure that the DOM used in investigation is representative of DOM in the ecosystem.																	0306-7319						1997	66	2					119	136		10.1080/03067319708028356						WOS:000072173800004

During the 4-month study period, DOC ranged from 0.8 to 10.4 mg C liter(-1) and was, on average, composed of 75% humic substances, 13% carbohydrates, 2% amino acids, and 18% > 100 kDa. The carbohydrates were predominantly polysaccharides, nearly all amino acids were present in the combined form, and most carbohydrates and amino acids were humic bound. BDOC ranged from 0.2 to 2.9 mg C liter(-1), averaged 25% of the DOG, and was composed of 75% humic substances, 30% carbohydrates, 4% amino acids, and 39% DOC > 100 kDa. The carbohydrate portion of the BDOC was primarily polysaccharide or humic bound. Similarly, the amino acid portion of the BDOC was overwhelmingly present in the combined form and primarily humic bound. Glycine and aspartic acid were the dominant amino acids in White Clay Creek DOC and in the BDOC pool. Our data broaden the perspective on substrates important to microbial metabolism and energy Bow in streams and provide the first direct evidence that humic substances, although largely refractory, are an important component of streamwater BDOC.																	0024-3590					JAN	1997	42	1					39	44								WOS:A1997XK60100004		
J	Doval, MD; AlvarezSalgado, XA; Perez, FF				Doval, MD; AlvarezSalgado, XA; Perez, FF			Dissolved organic matter in a temperate embayment affected by coastal upwelling	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												From September 1994 to September 1995 a time-series station in the Ria de Vigo (NW Spain) was monitored fortnightly. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was analysed by high temperature catalytic oxidation. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was determined by the Kjeldahl method, after removal of inorganic nitrogen from the sample. The time courses of DOC and DON changes were parallel. The average C/N molar ratio of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was similar to 15. DOM was strongly influenced by physical and biological processes. During the upwelling season, the entry of DOM-poor Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) controlled DOM levels in subsurface waters. Biologically produced DOM excess in surface waters was uncoupled with chlorophyll a on a daily time-scale. A tentative partitioning of DOM during the upwelling season has been inferred from mixing of oceanic and freshwater endmembers. The refractory pool, similar to 70% of total DOC in surface water, was carried by upwelled ENACW (60%, 10% of which was semi-refractory) and continental water (10%). Net production of semi-labile DOC occurred in the bottom layer (similar to 10 mu M C). The average DOC excess in surface waters compared to bottom waters was 21 mu M C, with a C/N molar ratio of 12. The excess was a mixture of labile and semi-labile material with a recycling time >5 d, which represented similar to 23 and similar to 13 % of the net primary production for C and N respectively. The average DOM excess/[POM (particulate organic matter) + DOM excess] ratio in surface waters was similar to 0.4 and similar to 0.3 for C and N respectively, indicating that POM was the most important pool of organic matter net produced in the inner ria. During the downwelling season DOM was balanced by the external inputs and the DOM excess in surface waters was due to the freshwater contribution.

The investigation has considered the validity of the currently proposed modelling of the absorption of these two components as a single variable, in applications to Case II water environments. In order to encompass a broad range of environmental situations (within coastal Case II waters) in the comparison of NCP and CDOM absorption spectra, two very different sites were selected. The locations investigated were the Southern Baltic Proper and a site in the Northern Adriatic close to the Italian coast. These two regions differ both in their basic oceanographic properties and in their relative proportions of Optically Active Components (OAC). Furthermore, the datasets considered illustrate the variability at different scales in both space and time, combining a series of seasonal oceanographic campaigns in the Baltic with a complete annual timeseries of monthly measurements at a fixed point in the Adriatic. The analysis has shown that, in the selected European Case II waters, the observed variability of the spectral absorption of NCP and CDOM, both with respect to each other as well as to the total absorption, are independent. It is therefore suggested that, in the Frame of Reflectance modelling in Case II waters, attention must be placed on accounting for NCP and CDOM individually when defining the absorption segment.																			0-8194-2367-X				1997	2963						401	407		10.1117/12.266473						WOS:A1997BH31C00062

In this area upwelling provided nutrient-rich water creating a mesotrophic environment. Below the surface mixed layer runs the Equatorial Undercurrent, which was marked by increases in salinity and absorption by CDOM. The magnitude of the absorption appears to be correlated with salinity even though there are no terrigenous inputs into this region. In the surface water the CDOM absorption is an important portion of the total absorption in the blue portion of the spectrum. Below the mixed layer the dissolved component absorption was the dominant non-water optical component.																			0-8194-2367-X				1997	2963						508	513								WOS:A1997BH31C00080

Thus UV penetrates deeper into marine waters than into freshwater systems. DOM is efficiently cleaved by solar surface radiation levels consuming more oxygen than bacterial metabolism. This photolytically cleaved DOM exhibits higher absorbance ratios (250/365 nm) than untreated DOM. Natural bacterioplankton reach higher abundance if inoculated in previously solar-exposed DOM than in untreated DOM; during bacterial growth the absorbance ratio declines steadily indicating the utilization of the photolytically cleaved DOM. On the other hand, bacterioplankton are greatly reduced in their activity if exposed to surface solar radiation levels. Photoenzymatic repair of DNA induced by W-A radiation, however, leads to an efficient recovery of bacterial activity once the UV-B stress is released. Turbulent mixing of the upper layers of the water column leads to a continuous alteration of the UV exposure regime. Close to the surface, bacteria and DOM are exposed to high levels of UV-B leading to a reduction in bacterial activity and to photolysis of DOM. Once mixed into deeper layers where W-B is attenuated, but sufficient UV-A is remaining to allow photoenzymatic repair, the photolytically cleaved DOM is efficiently taken up by bacterioplankton leading to even higher bacterial activity than prior to the exposure. Thus, the overall effect of UV on bacterioplankton is actually an enhancement of bacterial activity despite their lack of protective pigments.

J	Kaiser, K; Zech, W				Kaiser, K; Zech, W			Competitive sorption of dissolved organic matter fractions to soils and related mineral phases	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Experiments with soils, Al(OH)(3) gel, and goethite were conducted to investigate the competitive sorption of hydrophilic and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions and inorganic anions such as SO42- and H2PO4-. The DOM for the experiments was extracted from a mor layer. The ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic dissolved organic carbon was 37/63. The sorption of the hydrophobic DOM fraction was strongly favored over the binding of the hydrophilic fractions on soils and hydrous oxides. Under conditions of a limited number of available binding sites, the preferential sorption of hydrophobic DOM suppressed the binding of hydrophilic DOM or even resulted in a displacement of indigenous hydrophilic organic substances. Favorable chemical properties were assumed to be responsible for the strong sorption of hydrophobic DOM. The SO42- induced little reduction of the DOM sorption, whereas H2PO4- caused a strong decrease. The effects of both inorganic anions were more pronounced for the hydrophilic than for the hydrophobic DOM fraction. As the sorption of hydrophilic DOM was strongly affected by inorganic anions and hydrophobic DOM, hydrophilic DOM seems to be the most mobile organic component in soil solutions. The results give evidence that competitive interactions among the chemically heterogeneous DOM constituents need to be considered in DOM transport process in soils.

In this paper, only the simulation model (modified PROCELL) calibration for bleached kraft process is discussed. The simulation model was calibrated with dissolved organic matter (DOM) using dissolved volatile solids (DVS) values and operational information of a mill. Calibrated DOM in carryover and filtrate throughout the fibreline differed by 10% or less from the measured values in the mill. Complete degradation of DOM to inorganics within the production process is required to make the organic matter balance complete. In the calibrated fibreline, complete degradation of DOM proved to be of the same magnitude as the DOM load from bleaching filtrates (Dg and E(1)). Complete balance evaluation facilitates the control of the fate of DOM. Data analyzing procedure was developed to determine the basic structure of the DOM (CaHbONc). The information of conventional analyses of DOM such as organic carbon (DOC), DVS and chemical oxygen demand (DCODCr was developed to elucidate the basic structure of DOM. The degree of oxidation is one feature derived from the structure of DOM. The degree of oxidation seemed to be less in the filtrate than in the carryover in the alkaline stages, while the reverse was occurred in the acid stages.

J	Vallino, JJ; Hopkinson, CS; Hobbie, JE				Vallino, JJ; Hopkinson, CS; Hobbie, JE			Modeling bacterial utilization of dissolved organic matter: Optimization replaces Monod growth kinetics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A bioenergetic model has been developed to examine growth kinetics associated with bacterial utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), NH4+, and NO3-. A set of 11 metabolic reactions are used to govern the incorporation, oxidation, and N remineralization of DOM and dissolved inorganic N associated with bacterial growth. For each reaction, free energies and electron transfer requirements are calculated based on the C, H, O, and N composition of the substrates and their concentration in the environment. From these reactions, an optimization problem is constructed in which bacterial growth rate is maximized subject to constraints on energetics, electron balances, substrate uptake kinetics, and bacterial C:N ratio. The optimization approach provides more information on bacterial growth kinetics than do the Monod-type models that are typically used to describe bacterial growth. Simulations are ran to examine bacterial C yield and growth rate, N remineralization or immobilization, and substrate preferences as resource concentrations and compositions are varied. Results from the model agree well with observations in the literature, which indicate that the premise of the model, that bacteria allocate resources to maximize growth rate, may be an accurate overall description of bacterial growth. Simulations indicate that bacterial growth rate and yield are strongly correlated to the oxidation state of the labile DOM, as determined from its bulk elemental composition. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that bacterial growth cannot always be explained by a single constraint (such as the C:N ratio of substrate), since several constraints are often active simultaneously and continuously change with environmental conditions.

J	Ferrari, GM; Dowell, MD; Grossi, S; Targa, C				Ferrari, GM; Dowell, MD; Grossi, S; Targa, C			Relationship between the optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter and total concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the southern Baltic Sea region	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Absorption and fluorescence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) measurements were performed during three oceanographic surveys in 1994 in the southern Baltic Sea (Polish area of the Baltic Proper). DOC was measured both by high-temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) and low-temperature oxidation (LTO) conventional persulphate methods. CDOM fluorescence was shown to be highly correlated with absorption, with the same regression parameters, despite the seasonal change in different hydrographic conditions and the fluorescence quantum yield variations (1.23+/-0.07 in April and 0.97+/-0.12 in September). The results show a good correlation between the optical parameters and DOC although similar to 70% of the DOC does not display significant absorption in the UV-visible range (350-750 nm). The non-absorbing DOC measured with HTCO method appears unaffected by seasonal changes. Consequently, total DOC can be predicted by optical methods using remote sensing techniques. The non-absorbing DOC measured by LTO method varies from 62% (April) to 76% (September), which implies that there is requirement for estimates on a seasonal basis.																	0304-4203					DEC	1996	55	3-4					299	316		10.1016/S0304-4203(96)00061-8						WOS:A1996WC87500007		
J	Noblet, JA; Smith, LA; Suffet, IH				Noblet, JA; Smith, LA; Suffet, IH			Influence of natural dissolved organic matter, temperature, and mixing on the abiotic hydrolysis of triazine and organophosphate pesticides	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Abiotic hydrolysis of simazine, atrazine, diazinon, methylparathion, and chlorpyrifos was studied in three different natural waters and buffered Milli-Q water. The triazines showed no detectable decrease in concentration in any of the waters over 43 days at pH 8.0 and 40 degrees C. The rates of hydrolysis for diazinon and methylparathion were statistically similar in all waters tested. Chlorpyrifos exhibited a similar to 32% decrease in hydrolysis rate in the presence of a high concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) (34.5 mg/L dissolved organic carbon). The activation energies are larger, and thus the predicted hydrolysis rates are significantly slower than those previously reported. The effect of continuous vigorous mixing on hydrolysis rates was investigated and found to have only a minor effect. The results suggest that uncatalyzed abiotic hydrolysis is very slow for these compounds at the temperatures and pH's typical of most natural waters and affirm the need for a greater understanding of the relative influence of DOM, catalysis, and biodegradation on the fate of organophosphate and triazine pesticides.																	0021-8561					NOV	1996	44	11					3685	3693		10.1021/jf960315r						WOS:A1996VT71000052

In situ regulated and unregulated benthic chambers, sediment cores, and laboratory tank incubations were used to study early diagenesis of FDOM in coastal marine sediments of the Gullmar Fjord, western Sweden. In the regulated in situ chambers, pH and oxygen were kept at relatively stable levels, while in the unregulated in situ chambers, pH and oxygen were left to decrease as a result of biological activity. FDOM porewater distributions and correlation between FDOM and parameters indicating mineralization showed that FDOM was formed in the sediment and should flux across the sediment-water interface. A substantial flux of FDOM was also observed during winter and spring conditions and during anoxic conditions fall. However, no flux was observed during oxic conditions fall. Modeling indicated that oxygen penetration depth was deeper during winter than during fall, i.e., the oxygen penetration depth increased during fall towards winter values. We suggest that as FeOOH was formed when oxygen penetration depths increased, FDOM was sorbed to newly formed FeOOH, inhibiting FDOM flux over the sediment-water interface. In addition, at onset of anoxic conditions in the sediment surface layer in fall incubations, FDOM flux from sediment to overlying water increased substantially. Increases in anoxic FDOM fluxes were accompanied by increases in Fe and phosphate fluxes. We suggest that reductively dissolved FeOOH released sorbed FDOM. FDOM released from FeOOH by anoxic conditions was not resorbed when oxic conditions were resumed. This could be an effect of higher pH in overlying water as compared with porewater, inhibiting FeOOH sorption of FDOM.

J	Ohno, T; Crannell, BS				Ohno, T; Crannell, BS			Green and animal manure-derived dissolved organic matter effects on phosphorus sorption	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from common soil amendments and citric acid on the P sorption of an acidic soil. Hairy vetch (Vivia billosa L.) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) were used as sources for green manure-derived DOM. Cattle manure (Bos taurus) and poultry manure (Gallus domesticus) were used as sources for animal manure-derived DOM, The negative charge density of the water-soluble DOM ranged from 4.6 to 13.4 mmol(c) g(-1) C. Estimated molecular weight ranges were 710 to 850 for the green manure DOM and 2000 to 2800 for the animal manure DOM, Phosphorus sorption experiments were conducted at 40 mmol P kg(-1) soil and 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mM total soluble carbon (C-TS) for each green and animal manure source. The DOM extracted from vetch and clover, as well as citric acid, inhibited P sorption in the order citric acid > clover > vetch, The DOM extracted from the animal manures did not affect P sorption, The ability of the green manure DOM to inhibit P sorption was related to its ability to react with soil Al through ligand exchange reactions at lower DOM concentrations and through complexation reactions at higher DOM concentrations. The average ratio of Al solubilization to P sorption inhibition on a molar basis was 1.76 +/- 0.44. Ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence data suggested that the higher molecular weight of the animal manure derived-DOM was a factor ia its inability to react with soil Al. The results of this study suggest that management systems that use green manures may increase the availability of P by decreasing the sorption of added P to soils.																	0047-2425					SEP-OCT	1996	25	5					1137	1143								WOS:A1996VH79300027

COM(1) (1 kDa-0.2 mu m) was 59% of the bulk DOM in surface Chesapeake Bay waters and decreased to 30-35% in waters of the MAB. COM(10) (10 kDa-0.2 mu m), which was the high-molecular-weight (HMW) component of COM(1), comprised 3-12% of the bulk DOM, with highest concentrations in Chesapeake Bay waters and the lowest in deep waters in the MAB. Delta(14)C values of COM(1) decreased from nearshore (-21 to +12 parts per thousand) to offshore and from surface (-166 to -85 parts per thousand) to bottom waters (-400 to -304 parts per thousand). Although Delta(14)C values of surface-water HMW COM(10) were generally high (-2 to -7 parts per thousand), values for bottom-water COM(10) were much lower (-129 to -709 parts per thousand). The high Delta(14)C values in the surface water suggest a particulate origin of pelagic COM, consistent with the contemporary Delta(14)C values of particulate organic matter (POM). The very low Delta(14)C values of bottom-water COM(10) imply that in addition to the pelagic origin, sedimentary organic C may serve as an important source for the benthic colloids in the bottom nepheloid layer. The general flow direction of organic carbon is from POM to HMW and to LMW DOM. Three colloidal end-members were identified in the MAB as well as in the Gulf of Mexico: estuarine colloids with high Delta(14)C values, high C:N ratios, and lower delta(13)C values; offshore surface water colloids with intermediate Delta(14)C values, lower C:N ratios, and higher delta(13)C values; and offshore deep-water colloids with low Delta(14)C values, intermediate C:N ratios, and variable delta(13)C values.

J	Arrigo, KR; Brown, CW				Arrigo, KR; Brown, CW			Impact of chromophoric dissolved organic matter on UV inhibition of primary productivity in the sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A model was developed to assess the impact of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on phytoplankton production within the euphotic zone. The rate of depth-integrated daily gross primary productivity within the euphotic zone (integral(z)GPP(ez)) was evaluated as a function of dale, latitude, CDOM absorption (a(CDOM)) characteristics, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration, vertical stratification, and phytoplankton sensitivity to UV radiation (UVR). Results demonstrated that primary production was enhanced in the upper similar to 30 m of the water column by the presence of CDOM, where predicted increases in production due to the removal of damaging UVR more than offset its reduction resulting from the absorption of photosynthetically usable radiation. At greater depths, where Little UVR remained, primary production was always reduced due to removal by CDOM of photosynthetically usable radiation. When CDOM was distributed homogeneously within the euphotic zone, integral(z)GPP(ez) was reduced under most bio-optical (i.e. solar zenith angle, chi a and CDOM absorption, and ozone concentration) and photophysiological (i.e. sensitivity to UVR) conditions because the predicted reduction in primary production at depth was greater than the enhancement of production at the surface. A reduction in integral(z)GPP(ez) was also predicted when CDOM or phyloplankton was restricted to near-surface waters (similar to 30 m) and CDOM absorption was moderate [a(CDOM)(450) > 0.015 m(-1)]. integral(z)GPP(ez), however, was enhanced when CDOM or phytoplankton was restricted to a very shallow surface layer (similar to 10 m), even ii CDOM absorption was high [a(CDOM)(lambda) at 450 nm similar to 0.07 m(-1)]. Changes in integral(z)GPP(ez) resulting from the presence of CDOM were only slightly sensitive to ozone concentrations. In well-mixed waters where the flux of UVB is relatively high, such as in the Southern Ocean when the ozone hole is present, the presence of CDOM should result in little or no enhancement of integral(z)GPP(ez), although phytoplankton production would be expected to increase somewhat in surface waters.

J	Zweifel, UL; Blackburn, N; Hagstrom, A				Zweifel, UL; Blackburn, N; Hagstrom, A			Cycling of marine dissolved organic matter .1. An experimental system	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The degradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), together with bacterial growth and mortality, was studied in a multi-stage flow-through system. Particle-free sterile seawater was used as growth substrate and fed into vessels containing bacteria and viruses with or without flagellates. The residence time spanned from 30 to 1800 h. The rate of net organic carbon consumption decreased 3 orders of magnitude with increasing residence time (from 0.45 to 0.001 mu M C h(-1)). Interestingly, we found a significantly higher DOC consumption in the presence of flagellates (1.3 to 10 times higher). Viruses were abundant in all culture vessels (1.7 to 6.5 x 10(10) l(-1)), indicating active virus production within the system. The number of nucleoid-containing bacteria decreased with increasing residence time from 68% of the total count at the shortest residence time to 30% at the longest residence time. Also, with bacteria only, the total number of bacteria decreased at the longest residence time. We argue that with a long residence time the internal cycling of organic matter increased and that the fraction of viable bacteria decreased substantially resulting in a large fraction of 'ghosts'.																	0948-3055					AUG 29	1996	11	1					65	77		10.3354/ame011065						WOS:A1996VF81000007		
J	Blackburn, N; Zweifel, UL; Hagstrom, A				Blackburn, N; Zweifel, UL; Hagstrom, A			Cycling of marine dissolved organic matter .2. A model analysis	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Nutrient pathways within the microbial food web were analysed using a mechanistic model based on a multi-stage flow-through experimental system. Good agreement with measured values reflected the model's ability to function on 3 different orders of magnitude with respect to turnover time. Important observations made from the experimental system included the production of viruses, the presence of dead bacterial cells (ghosts), and the production of detritus. This led to the concept that the bacterial community forms a continuum from Live uninfected cells through infected cells, dead cells, degraded cells (detritus) and ends in dissolved organic matter. Enzymatic degradation of dissolved organic matter was balanced by its release during cell lysis caused by viruses, predation by flagellates, and degradation of detritus. This formed 3 closed loops in the model for nutrient recycling. Simulations predicted that phosphorus recycling occurred via nucleic acids released during cell lysis caused by viruses and that nitrogen was recycled via proteins released as a combined result of cell lysis caused by viruses, predation by flagellates, and degradation of detritus. This implies that for natural ecosystems, the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon species for bacterial growth can be dominated by internal recycling, depending on the molecular species in question and the turnover time. Different nutrients are made available by different processes of recycling which potentially occur on different time scales.																	0948-3055					AUG 29	1996	11	1					79	90		10.3354/ame011079						WOS:A1996VF81000008

This technique based on gel permeation was first optimized for its application to urban wastewater characterization in terms of organic compound molecular weight distribution. The technique was then used to qualitatively compare two different wastewater treatment processes. The comparison showed markedly different removal efficiencies on each class of compounds defined by a molecular weight range and demonstrated that this technique could be used to better characterize treatment processes.																	0011-9164					AUG	1996	106	1-3					213	224								WOS:A1996VE63800028		
J	Lebron, I; Suarez, DL				Lebron, I; Suarez, DL			Calcite nucleation and precipitation kinetics as affected by dissolved organic matter at 25 degrees C and pH>7.5	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We examined the processes of calcite nucleation and crystal growth to determine the dominant mechanism for precipitation of calcite in the presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOG). Our experiments, conducted at 25 degrees C and at a Ca:HCO3 molar ratio of 1:2, were performed with and without calcite seeds. Scanning electron micrograph observations showed that the particle size of calcite crystals in the presence of DOC = 0.02 mM and after 24 h reached values bigger than 100 mu m, while at the same saturation value (Omega), when the DOC = 0.15 mM, the size of the crystals were < 2 mu m for the same period of time. A crystal growth experiment in the presence of different DOC concentrations and 2 m(2) L(-1) of calcite crystals showed that precipitation was not detectable when 0.11 mmol m(2) of carbon was coating the calcite crystals. This surface coverage corresponds to a DOC in solution of 0.05 mM. The rate of calcite precipitation was measured at different concentrations of DOC in quartz sand and quartz sand-Silver Hill illite suspensions with calcite Omega values between 1 and 50 and a CO2 partial pressure of 35 Pa. The precipitation rate of calcite in the sand:solution suspensions decreased eightfold as the DOC increased from 0.02 to 0.15 mM at a Omega value of 9.0. Precipitation was completely inhibited in the Omega range of 1-24 when the DOC was 0.3 mM or greater. In the sand-illite suspensions, a similar eightfold decrease in the precipitation rate of calcite was observed when the DOC increased from 0.28 to 2.78 mM at a Omega value of 9.0. Differences in calcite precipitation rates between sand and sand-clay systems are likely due to differences in the number of potential heterogeneous nucleation sites. Experimental data were described by the equation: R(T) = R(CG) + R(HN), where RT is the total precipitation rate of calcite (mM s(-1)), RCG is the calcite precipitation rate due to crystal growth, and R(HN) is the precipitation rate due to heterogeneous nucleation. R(CG) for natural systems is related to the DOC of the suspension by the expression: R(CG) = sk(CG)([Ca+2][CO3-2]-K-SP)f(DOC)(CG), where brackets represent activities, s is the surface area of the calcite crystals, k(CG) is the precipitation rate constant due to crystal growth, K-SP is the solubility of pure calcite at 25 degrees C, and f(DOC)(CG) is the precipitation rate reduction for crystal growth with DOG. Experimentally we determined that R(CG) = 0 when DOC greater than or equal to 0.05 mM. R(HN) was related to Omega with the following expression: R(HN) = k(HN)f(SA)(log Omega-2.5)f(DOC)(HN), where k(HN) is the precipitation rate constant due to heterogeneous nucleation, f(SA) is a function of the surface area of the particles in suspension, 2.5 is the Omega value at which no further precipitation by nucleation was observed, and f(DOC)(HN) is the function representing the reduction in precipitation by heterogeneous nucleation due to inhibition of DOG. The above equation, developed for natural environments, predicts that the overall calcite precipitation rate is unaffected by the existing calcite surface area when the DOC in the system is greater than or equal to 0.05 mM.				lebron, Inma/A-4762-2013	lebron, Inma/0000-0001-8610-9717												0016-7037					AUG	1996	60	15					2765	2776		10.1016/0016-7037(96)00137-8						WOS:A1996VC08800004		
J	Cherrier, J; Bauer, JE; Druffel, ERM				Cherrier, J; Bauer, JE; Druffel, ERM			Utilization and turnover of labile dissolved organic matter by bacterial heterotrophs in eastern north Pacific surface waters	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seawater incubation experiments were conducted in June and October 1992 to examine bacterial utilization of labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) in open ocean surface waters of the eastern North Pacific. Natural plankton extract-DOM (PE-DOM) and selected model compounds were added to seawater samples to evaluate bacterial utilization and respiration rates relative to bacterial carbon production rates for the various amendments. PE-DOM always stimulated bacterial production and DOM utilization, and the primary nitrogen source supporting this bacterial production was dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Utilization of DON during exponential growth was balanced by the production of ammonium for samples amended with PE-DOM. Bacterial growth efficiencies for samples amended with PE-DOM ranged between 3.4 and 8.8 % and generally were slightly higher in June than in October. Of the model compounds tested, net bacterial biomass production was observed only in samples amended with glucose, glucose plus ammonium (glucose+NH4+), and dissolved free amino acids (DFAA). Bacterial growth efficiencies for these amendments were 0.8, 1.9, and and 9.3.%, respectively. Bacterial production at in situ DOM concentrations was observed in June but not in October. Using the bacterial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) utilization rates observed in this study together with other detailed information pertaining to bulk DOC at our study site, we estimate that the turnover time for labile DOC in these surface waters ranges from approximately 2 to 6 d depending on the labiliity of the standing stock of DOC. On the basis of (a) the exclusive use of DON as a nitrogen source in PE-DOM amendments, (b) the stimulation of ammonium utilization in the glucose+NH4+ amendment, and (c) the higher growth efficiencies observed for samples amended with either PE-DOM or DFAA, we suggest that bacterioplankton biomass production in eastern North Pacific surface waters is primarily energy limited. As a result of this energy limitation, bacterial production appears to be additionally constrained by the quality of the nutrients available for assimilation. Thus, the quality of the DOM substrate, specifically the DOC:DON ratio, can be a major determinant of bacterial production in pelagic marine systems.																	0171-8630					AUG	1996	139	1-3					267	279		10.3354/meps139267						WOS:A1996VG03400022

Scaling up of the separation scheme to a semi-preparative scale, suitable for hyphenated techniques, was also investigated. Separations with reversed-phase columns suggested that similar to 70-93% of the DOM was hydrophilic, and ion-pair chromatography of this fraction showed the presence of several discrete compounds. Labile and non-labile complexes were formed by adding Co-60 radiotracer. Size-exclusion chromatography indicated that the DOM was primarily in the <1000-1500 Da molecular mass range.																	0021-9673					JUL 19	1996	739	1-2					281	294		10.1016/0021-9673(96)00077-5						WOS:A1996UZ35500035		
J	Beck, AJ; Jones, KC				Beck, AJ; Jones, KC			The effects of particle size, organic matter content, crop residues and dissolved organic matter on the sorption kinetics of atrazine and isoproturon by clay soil	CHEMOSPHERE												Reliable predictions of the fate and behaviour of pesticides in soils is dependent on the use of accurate 'equilibrium' sorption constants and/or rate coefficients. However, the sensitivity of these parameters to changes in the physicochemical characteristics of soil solids and interstitial solutions remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of soil organic matter content, particle size distribution, dissolved organic matter and the presence of crop residues (wheat straw and ash) on the sorption of the herbicides atrazine and isoproturon by a clay soil. Sorption Kd's derived from batch 'equilibrium' studies for both atrazine and isoproturon by <2 mm clay soil were approximately 3.5 L/kg. The similarity of K-oc's for isoproturon sorption by the <2 mm clay soil and <2 mm clay soil oxidised with hydrogen peroxide suggested that the sorption of this herbicide was strongly influenced by soil organic matter. By contrast, K-oc's for atrazine sorption by oxidised soil were three times greater than those for <2 mm soil, indicating that the soil mineral components might have affected sorption of this herbicide. No significant differences between the sorption of either herbicide by <2 mm clay soil and (i) <250 mu m clay soil, (ii) clay soil mixed with wheat straw or ash at ratios similar to those observed under field conditions, (iii) <2 mm clay soil in the presence of dissolved organic matter as opposed to organic free water, were observed.

The bacterially mediated turnover of chemically identifiable, low-molecular-mass components of this pool has been studied in detail for nearly three decades, but these compounds constitute less than 20% of the total reservoir(2). In contrast, little is known about the fate of the larger, biologically more refractory molecules-including humic substances-which make up the bulk of dissolved organic matter. Here we report results from bacterial bioassays and photochemical studies indicating that exposure to sunlight causes dissolved organic matter to release nitrogen-rich compounds that are biologically available, thus enhancing the bacterial degradation of humic substances. We demonstrate that ammonium is among the nitrogenous compounds released and is produced most efficiently by ultraviolet wavelengths. Photochemical release of ammonium from dissolved organic matter has important implications for nitrogen availability in many aquatic ecosystems, including nitrogen-limited high-latitude environments and coastal oceans, where inputs of terrestrial humic substances are high.

Determination of these parameters depends on analytical methods that can distinguish between free and organically bound metal ions. This speciation is difficult, mainly because natural organic matter typically is a complex mixture. In this paper, multi-wavelength molecular fluorescence spectrometry is evaluated prototypically as a method for the determination of stability constants and binding capacities for Cu(II) and Al(III) complexation by dissolved organic matter in a juniper leaf litter extract. Equilibrium ion exchange quantitation and electron spin resonance spectroscopy served as quantitative and qualitative reference methods, respectively. Three types of binding site for Cu and Al could be differentiated qualitatively by the reaction patterns of various wavelength regions of the total luminescence spectrum of the leaf litter extract in response to increasing metal ion addition. For both Cu (pH 6) and Al (pH 5), binding parameters for the two types of binding site forming the most stable complexes were deduced self-consistently from reactions evaluated at selected excitation/emission wavelength pairs.																	0013-936X					MAY	1996	30	5					1565	1574		10.1021/es950542u						WOS:A1996UG95400049

The applicability of the free-ion model, as it applied to the toxicity of aluminum to the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa in the presence of a soil fulvic acid (SFA), was tested in defined media (pH 5) designed to limit Al interactions to algae and SFA. Toxicity was not proportional to the activity of Al3+, apparent failing of the free-ion model. fulvic acid adsorbed to cell surfaces (17 mg m(-2), pH 5) and increased membrane permeability (as measured with [C-14]sorbitol) whereas Al decreased membrane permeability. in addition, SFA may act as a source of phosphorus to P-deficient algae. These results emphasize the importance of considering not only the metal-complexing properties of natural dissolved organic matter but also its direct metabolic and physiological influences on algae.

The data on estimations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) by the two methods in the waters of the Black, Bering, and Okhotsk seas are presented. The different degree of oxidation is shown to depend on the region and depth. It is concluded that the HTCO is more preferable for DOC determination, as it is easier to standardize, whitle the values obtained by the method of wet oxidation are influenced by a lot of hardly accountable factors.																	0030-1574					MAY-JUN	1996	36	3					470	477								WOS:A1996UZ80300020

QUIMICA NOVA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural waters, has a fundamental contribution to the global carbon budget and plays an important role in major biogeochemical process such as complexation of metals and photochemical reactions. Part of this material fluoresces when irradiated with ultraviolet light and this property has been widely used to study biogeochemical cycles involving DOM. More or less 80% of this material are represented by humic substances. These compounds exhibit optical properties and are responsible for most of observed fluorescence. In this review we present the main information published in the last years concerning the utilisation of fluorescence as a tracer for DOM and humic compounds. A brief view of the basic principles of fluorescence is also presented.

J	Gerritse, RG				Gerritse, RG			Column- and catchment-scale transport of cadmium: Effect of dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In the Ellen catchment on the Pinjarra Plain, NE of Perth in Western Australia, cadmium from fertilisers is starting to leach from soils. About 70% of surface soils in the Ellen catchment are sandy and often on top of a shallow ephemeral water table. Adsorption of Cd in the sandy soils of the Ellen catchment was studied by batch adsorption and by leaching small columns of soil, Adsorption of Cd increases linearly with increasing soil organic matter content and exponentially with increasing pH. Cadmium is significantly mobilised in the sandy soils by dissolved organic matter. The capacity of most of the sandy soils in the Ellen catchment to adsorb phosphate from fertiliser hhs been saturated. Resulting concentrations in Ellen Brook average similar to 500 mu g L(-1) P, Cadmium is adsorbed more strongly in the sandy soils than phosphate and is just starting to leach into Ellen Brook. From a comparison of Cd/P ratios in water, soils and fertiliser, cadmium concentrations in Ellen Brook are estimated to be at 10-30% of their maximum for complete breakthrough from soils. Present concentrations of Cd in Ellen Brook average similar to 0.1 mu g L(-1) and are estimated to approach the maximum for complete breakthrough in similar to 100 yr, Maximum Cd concentrations in Ellen Brook could range from 0.6 to 2 mu g L(-1), depending on rates of input with fertiliser and future increases in agricultural land use in the catchment. Breakthrough curves, resulting from leaching Cd through small columns of sandy soil, indicate that adsorption significantly increases the effective hydrodynamic dispersion of Cd. Longitudinal dispersivities, measured at pore-water velocities of 0.7-14 m day(-1), were similar to 5 cm for Cd and similar to 0.1-0.2 cm for chloride. The much greater dispersion of Cd in the sandy soils than of chloride is shown not to be caused by non-equilibrium adsorption.																	0169-7722					APR	1996	22	3-4					145	163		10.1016/0169-7722(95)00085-2						WOS:A1996UN09200001		
J	Hirose, K				Hirose, K			Determination of a strong organic ligand dissolved in seawater: Thorium-complexing capacity of oceanic dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY-ARTICLES												A new method has been developed to measure a strong ligand in oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) by Th complexation in acidic media and the adsorption of the Th complex onto XAD-2 resin. Th reacts quantitatively with organic binding site of DOM in strong acid media (around 0.1M H+ solution), which is equilibrated within 24 hours. According to mass action analysis, Th forms a 1 : 1 complex with the binding site in DOM, whose conditional stability constant is 10(6.7)M(-1). The conditional stability constant of the Th complex in DOM is in good agreement with that determined for oceanic Particulate Matter (PM) under similar experimental conditions. This finding suggests that the chemical properties of the strong ligand in DOM are similar to these in biogenic PM. The Th-complexing capacity in DOM, which corresponds to the total concentration of the strong organic ligand, can be determined (2-3 nM in surface waters) in a small volume (about 200 ml). The method has a detection limit of approximately 0.05 nM for the thorium-complexing capacity of DOM by using Th-230.																	0236-5731					MAR	1996	204	1					193	204		10.1007/BF02060880						WOS:A1996UM20200019

Bacterial uptake of added labeled N compounds ((NH4+)-N-15 or N-15-labeled dissolved free amino acids, DFAA) was stimulated more by high-molecular-weight (HMW, >1 kDa) DOM than by low-molecular-weight (LMW, <1 kDa) DOM. An index that inversely indicated the presence of labile DOC was defined as the fraction of assimilated Amino acid-N-15 that was Recovered as N-15-Ammonium (ANRA), following the additions of high-levels (4 mu M) of N-15-DFAA. ANRA ratios were high in the absence of other available carbon sources because heterotrophic bacteria were forced to use the added amino acids as a carbon source for respiration rather than as a nutrient source for biomass formation. In dynamic light/dark experiments, conducted with in situ populations of organisms, uptake rates of added (NH4+)-N-15 were significantly enhanced both by the presence of light and by the addition of HMW DOM. Uptake rates of added N-15-labeled DFAA were increased by the addition of HMW DOM but not by light. ANRA ratios were consistently lower in the presence of added HMW DOM than in controls. Added HMW DOM thus appeared to stimulate the incorporation of assimilated DFAA into bacterial biomass. Bacterial growth rates were relatively high in both light and dark bottles with DFAA additions and in light bottles with HMW DOM plus NH4+ additions, but they remained comparatively low in dark bottles with added NH4+. These results are consistent with the idea that bacterial N dynamics in these euphotic waters may be tightly coupled to photosynthetic activities over short time scales.

A UV-induced degradation of organic matter was demonstrated by a decrease in UV absorbance, dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and fulvic acid content in irradiated replicates, compared to dark controls. Furthermore, qualitative changes in the DOC were observed. The absorbance ratio 254/365 nm increased in the irradiated replicates, indicating a decreased size of UV-absorbing organic matter. A UV-induced production of several low molecular weight (LMW) organic acids was also observed. A highly sensitive (mu g L(-1) level) capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method was used for identification and quantification of these organic acids. Oxalic, malonic, formic, and acetic acid were the major carboxylic acids produced, together accounting for about 0.18 mgCL(-1). This organic fraction could have a profound effect on the surface water environment, being highly available substrates for aerobic microorganisms as well as being potentially important for the function and distribution of trace metals.																	0160-4120						1996	22	5					501	506		10.1016/0160-4120(96)00038-4						WOS:A1996VG55900006

Among the environmental factors that alter the solubility of a molecule is naturally occurring dissolved organic carbon (DOG). We have hypothesized that the DOC from different sources within a watershed have different binding affinities for pollutants such as pyrene. This could lead to different rates of transport or bioavailability within the watershed. DOC samples have been isolated from a stream, adjacent wetland and nearby wooded upland sites. A fluorescence quenching method was developed to quantify the binding coefficient of the pollutants with the dissolved organic carbon. From these results a model has been constructed to determine the sites with the greatest potential to modify pollutant contamination in the environment.																	0097-6156		0-8412-3468-X				1996	651						288	298								WOS:A1996BG78B00018

J	Amon, RMW; Benner, R				Amon, RMW; Benner, R			Bacterial utilization of different size classes of dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bacterial utilization of high-molecular-weight (HMW; >1 kDa) and low-molecular-weight (LMW; <1 kDa) dissolved organic C (DOC) was investigated in freshwater and marine systems by measuring dissolved oxygen consumption, bacterial abundance, and bacterial production in size-fractionated samples. Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was used to separate HMW and LMW DOC. More than 80% of the DOC in Amazon River samples was recovered in the HMW fraction, whereas most marine DOC (up to 70%) was of LMW. Bacterial growth efficiencies were consistently higher in the LMW fractions (16-66%) than in the HMW fractions (8-39%), indicating compositional differences in the two size fractions. In all experiments, measured rates of bacterial growth and respiration in HMW incubations were higher than those in LMW incubations. Carbon-normalized bacterial DOC utilization rates were 1.4-4-fold greater in the HMW fractions than in the LMW fractions, and a greater proportion (0.7-22.5%) of HMW DOC was utilized per day than LMW DOC (0.5-6.6%). All bacterial growth and respiration measurements indicated that HMW DOC was utilized to a greater extent than LMW DOC in all environments investigated. The traditional model of DOM degradation, stating that LMW compounds are most bioreactive, does not appear to apply to the bulk of natural DOM. Rather, the data and results from independent studies suggest a new conceptual model whereby the bioreactivity of organic matter decreases along a continuum of size (from large to small) and diagenetic state (from fresh to old). This size-reactivity continuum model suggests that the bulk of HMW DOM is more bioreactive and less diagenetically altered than the bulk of LMW DOM.

J	Gunnarsson, JS; Rosenberg, R				Gunnarsson, JS; Rosenberg, R			Eutrophication increases the association of PCB to dissolved organic matter in marine microcosms	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Partitioning of C-14-2,2',4,4'-TCB (tetrachlorobiphenyl) between sediment, and water and suspended particles was studied in eutrophic and oligotrophic benthic microcosms, respectively. Microcosms consisted of glass aquaria with homogenized-clay sediment, circulated with natural seawater (60 m, 34 parts per thousand). Organic enrichment in the eutrophic treatment was obtained by adding a phytoplankton culture of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum into the water column; the oligotrophic aquaria received only filtered seawater. C-14-TCB was added to the water using a generator column technique. Phytoplankton and TCB were continuously added during an exposure phase of 8 days, followed by a semi-static phase in which TCB and phytoplankton were left to equilibrate and sediment during one month. Presence of phytoplankton induced a higher concentration of TCB in the water column. Higher concentration of TCB in the water was not caused by higher amounts of TCB bound to algal cells but due to an association of TCB with an increased production of dissolved organic matter and bacteria in the eutrophic treatment. TCB concentration in the sediments was not significantly different between treatments. The observed partitioning of TCB between water and sediment was in accordance with a predicted distribution, based on the equilibrium partitioning model.

Organic chemical association	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) are known to be associated with dissolved organic matter (DOM), but the mechanism is not fully understood. A data analysis algorithm (NOAEM) is proposed that refines the association to neutral carbon or cavities of DOM. Neutral carbon is estimated by the difference between total dissolved carbon and carbon associated with natural organic anion (NOA; NOAEM:Part I). The algorithm is based on SOC activity differences in combination with carbon normalized K-OW values. The combination directly and indirectly incorporates individual properties of the SOC, the ionic composition, ionic strength and pH of the sample, and a lognormal distribution of cavity volumes (parallel distribution to the NOA distribution). A product of the coefficients, concentrations of SOCs, and concentration of neutral carbon provides estimates for the amounts of associated SOCs. Literature data were utilized for preliminary validation of the algorithm. The theoretical equations are proposed and semiempirical constants reported.

Water samples were collected in the Sacca di Goro lagoon (Po river delta, Italy) and analysed by means of different techniques, such as fluorescence, absorption and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) measurements. Synchronous fluorescence spectra obtained from both laboratory algal cultures and benthic macroalgae collected in situ were compared with spectra from field samples in order to distinguish DOM components having autochthonous (algal) origin with respect to remote formation. Two main components could be identified on the basis of their synchronous fluorescent bands. The results indicated that the first band (band hA at lambda = 275 nm), prevailing in seawater samples, could reflect a recent biological production, while the second (bands hB and hC at lambda > 300 nm) prevailing in the tributaries water samples, could likely be due to older or remote formation. The synchronous peak height ratio hA:hB is proposed as an useful parameter describing the different contribution and mixing of the DOM components present in the lagoonal-estuarine waters.																	0171-8630					SEP	1995	125	1-3					305	315		10.3354/meps125305						WOS:A1995TB12400028

The ice was typical of Arctic multi-year ice, having a mean thickness along the profile of 2.56 +/- 0.53 m. It consisted mostly of columnar ice (83%) grown through congelation of seawater at the ice bottom, and the salinity profiles were characterized by a linear increase from 0 psu at the top to values ranging between 3 and 5 psu at depth. Distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) and major nutrients were compared with ice texture, salinity and chlorophyll a. DOC, DON, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), NH4+ and NO2- were present in concentrations in excess of that predicted by dilution curves derived from Arctic surface water values. Only NO3- was depleted, although not exhausted. High DOC and DON values in conjunction with high NH+4 levels indicated that a significant proportion of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) was a result of decomposition/grazing of ice algae and/or detritus. The combination of high NH4+ and NO2- points to regeneration of nitrogen compounds. There was no significant correlation between DOC and Chl a in contrast to DON, which had a positively significant correlation with both salinity and Chl a, and the distribution of DOM in the cores might best be described as a combination of both physical and biological processes. There was no correlation between DOC and DON suggesting an uncoupling of DOC and DON dynamics in multi year ice.

J	DING, JY; WU, SC				DING, JY; WU, SC			PARTITION-COEFFICIENTS OF ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES ON SOIL AND ON THE DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN WATER	CHEMOSPHERE												The partition coefficients of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) between the organic matter of Taichung soil and water (K-oc) were evaluated with batch-type experiments. The partition coefficients of OCPs between Aldrich humic acid and water (K-doc) were estimated with solubility enhancement method as well. In this study, the K(oc)s of aldrin, heptachlor, and p,p'-DDT are greater than their K(doc)s, and the relationship of dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide are opposite. The variations of partition coefficients are discussed. For predicting K-doc, a log-log regression relationship of K-doc and K-ow is determined.																	0045-6535					JUN	1995	30	12					2259	2266		10.1016/0045-6535(95)00099-T						WOS:A1995RF33900005		
J	GRZYB, KR				GRZYB, KR			NOAEM (NATURAL ORGANIC ANION EQUILIBRIUM-MODEL) - A DATA-ANALYSIS ALGORITHM FOR ESTIMATING FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS .1. IONIC COMPONENT SPECIATION AND METAL ASSOCIATION	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												NOAEM is a flexible data analysis algorithm (PC FORTRAN program) that estimates functional properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aqueous environments. Included are the quantity and quality of natural organic anion (NOA); kinds, quantities, and equilibrium constants of NOA bound metals; concentrations of ionic species; acid neutralizing capacity, conductivity, and ionic strength of the sample; and partitioning capacity of nonpolar portions of DOM for synthetic organic chemicals (NOAEM: Part II). NOAEM is based in ionic balance and determines parameters via the anion deficit of a sample. The assumptions are that NOA may be represented by a continuous distribution of individual anionic functional groups and that free and cation bound NOA exhibit a lognormal distribution of apparent pK values. Protolytic NOA is defined by four variables. Metal bound NOA is defined by three additional variables for each multivalent metal ion. Ions and ionic compounds that are not bound to NOA are speciated thermodynamically. The theoretical equations are reported and chemical data from a field site are utilized for preliminary validation of the model.																	0146-6380					MAY	1995	23	5					379	390		10.1016/0146-6380(95)00029-E						WOS:A1995RK40400002

J	MAGUIRE, RJ; BATCHELOR, SP; SULLIVAN, CA				MAGUIRE, RJ; BATCHELOR, SP; SULLIVAN, CA			REDUCTION OF THE EFFICIENCY OF EXTRACTION OF LIPOPHILIC CHEMICALS FROM WATER BY DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												A study was made of the efficiency of liquid-liquid extraction of eight chlorinated hydrocarbons of varying lipophilicity from filtered (1 mm) organic-free water, soil humic acid solution, lacustrine dissolved organic matter solution, and a natural water. The efficiency of hexane extraction of the spiked chemicals without pH adjustment (i.e., the conventional technique) was reduced with increasing concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and increasing chemical lipophilicity. At the same time, increasing amounts of the more lipophilic chemicals were found in subsequent extracts of the water at pH 12, and after chromic acid oxidation of the DOM. The results indicated that conventional liquid-liquid extraction underestimates the concentrations of ''dissolved'' highly lipophilic chemicals in fresh water, the extent of the underestimation depending upon the nature of the DOM. Sixteen-day exposure experiments with filtered natural waters containing roughly 5 mg/L DOM indicated that 6 to 8% of the most lipophilic chemical tested, mirex, was not recovered by standard hexane extraction without pH adjustment; with 5 mg/L of a soil-derived humic acid, 49% of mirex was not recovered by standard hexane extraction without pH adjustment. For highly lipophilic chemicals that are not destroyed by chronic acid oxidation, it is recommended that total concentrations in filtered or centrifuged fresh waters be determined by the chromic acid oxidation, it is recommended that total concentrations in filtered or centrifuged fresh waters be determined by the chronic acid oxidation/extraction technique.																	0730-7268					MAR	1995	14	3					389	393		10.1897/1552-8618(1995)14[389:ROTEOE]2.0.CO;2						WOS:A1995QH19900006		
J	CONZONNO, VH; CIRELLI, AF				CONZONNO, VH; CIRELLI, AF			DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN CHASCOMUS POND (ARGENTINA) - INFLUENCE OF CALCIUM-CARBONATE ON HUMIC-ACID CONCENTRATION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Water chemistry of the Chascomus Pond (Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina) was studied during a year characterized by low precipitation. Supersaturation of calcium carbonate up to a calcite saturation index of about 20 in spring and summer was observed, together with a diminution of the concentration of dissolved organic matter, in particular humic substances (HS). These results suggested an adsorption between organic matter and calcium carbonate which should influence the growth of calcium carbonate crystals. A preferential removal of higher molecular weight HS was observed by gel permeation chromatography experiments.																	0018-8158					FEB 3	1995	297	1					55	59		10.1007/BF00033501						WOS:A1995QH99200006		
J	CURTIS, PJ; ADAMS, HE				CURTIS, PJ; ADAMS, HE			DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER QUANTITY AND QUALITY FROM FRESH-WATER AND SALTWATER LAKES IN EAST-CENTRAL ALBERTA	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters of sub-humid to semi-arid lakes in east-central Alberta increase with increasing salinity and water residence time from about 20 to 330 mg L(-1) as dissolved organic carbon (DOG). This pattern is opposite to that observed among freshwater lakes spanning a gradient in water residence times, and is probably caused by evaporative concentration of refractory DOM. The proportion of total DOG, operationally defined as humic substances using XAD-8 resin, was high, though similar to surface waters typically referred to as ''humic'', and independent of salinity: Very long water residence times (hundreds of years) in saline lakes favors evapoconcentration of low-color, low molecular weight DOM, with N-content characteristic of allochthonous DOM.																	0168-2563						1995	30	1					59	76		10.1007/BF02181040						WOS:A1995TC14000004

Indigenous bacteria were inoculated into either 0.2 mu m natural filtered lake water, or lake water enriched fivefold with colloidal DOM >100 kD but below 0.2 mu m. Consumption of DOM was followed from changes in concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon (DOG), dissolved combined and free carbohydrates and amino acids (DCCHO and DFCHO, and DCAA and DFAA, respectively) and by uptake of monosaccharide and amino acid radioisotopes. DCCHO and DCAA made up 8% (humic lake) to 33-44% (clear-water lake) of the natural DOC pools, while DFCHO and DFAA contributed at most 1.7% to the DOC pools. Addition of >100 kD DOM increased the DOC concentrations by 50% (clearwater lake) to 92% (humic lake), but it only resulted in a higher bacterial production (by 63%) in the humic lake. During the incubations 13 to 37% of the DOC was assimilated by the bacteria, at estimated growth efficiencies of 4-8%. Despite the measured reduction of DOG, statistically significant changes of specific organic compounds, especially of DCCHO and DCAA, generally did not occur. Probably the presence of high molecular weight DOC interfered with the applied analytical procedures. Addition of radiotracers indicated, however, that DFAA sustained 17-58% and 29-100% of the bacterial carbon and nitrogen requirements, respectively, and that glucose met 1-3% of the bacterial carbon requirements. Thus, our experiments indicate that radiotracers, rather than measurements of concentration changes, should be used in studies of bacterial utilization of DOC in freshwaters with a high content of humic or high molecular weight organic matter.

J	LINDELL, MJ; GRANELI, W; TRANVIK, LJ				LINDELL, MJ; GRANELI, W; TRANVIK, LJ			ENHANCED BACTERIAL-GROWTH IN RESPONSE TO PHOTOCHEMICAL TRANSFORMATION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We tested the hypothesis that light, especially UV-B radiation, increases the availability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to pelagic bacteria in lake water. Filtered (0.2 mu m) and autoclaved humic lake water (water color 70 mg Pt liter(-1), 12 mg dissolved organic C liter(-1)) was exposed to simulated sunlight (UV-B, 1.14 W m(-2); UV-A, 3.87 W m(-2); and PAR, 20 W m(-2)) for various periods of time (0-100 h). Irradiated water was then inoculated with a natural bacterial assemblage (0.6-mu m filtered water) and bacterial yield was measured in the stationary phase of the resulting batch cultures. Both bacterial numbers and cell volumes increased (numbers by 65% and volumes as much as 360%) with increasing UV radiation, resulting in an almost sixfold increase in bacterial biomass. Our experiment shows that light exposure can enhance availability of natural lake DOM to bacteria, possibly through cleavage of macromolecules into smaller units, and may influence both carbon cycling and food webs in lake water.

A simple one-dimensional model of COS in the surface ocean mixed layer is then constructed and used to explore the sensitivity of COS to various forcing parameters. The model predicts that surface COS concentrations are very sensitive to vertical mixing within the mixed layer and are relatively insensitive to air-sea gas exchange. Due to the similarities between COS and CO, we believe the same conclusion applies to CO. This contrasts a previous study, which maintained that air-sea gas transfer exerts a greater influence on surface CO concentrations than does vertical mixing. In the model used here, wind speed and mixed layer depth greatly affect the intensity of vertical mixing within the mixed layer and thus are important parameters in governing surface concentrations of COS and CO. The model also pre diets that COS concentrations are extremely sensitive to temperature, due to the temperature dependence of COS hydrolysis. The possible effects of increased atmospheric CO2 and decreased stratospheric ozone on surface ocean COS are also explored. In the absence of other changes, our mixed layer model predicts that increased atmospheric CO2, through its effect on the basic hydrolysis of COS, will cause surface ocean COS to increase significantly. Using a model of atmospheric UV radiation, we estimate that the change in ozone from 1979 to 1992 has caused a significant increase in marine COS production. The percent increase is between 2% and 5% per decade in most regions poleward of 30 degrees to as much as 15% per decade under the ozone hole.

All the monitoring plots have as uniform as possible stand and site characteristics, The plots were located in Scots pine stands on dry and dryish sites with genetic horizons characteristic of Fe-humus podsols. The soil type on most of the sites was sorted fine sand or sand. Significant positive correlations were found between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and total dissolved Al concentrations at 5 and 20 cm, but not at 40 cm. A significant negative correlation was found between DOM and pH at 5 cm, but not at 20 or 40 cm. The anion deficit was positively correlated with DOM at 5 cm in the percolation water. Organic matter thus plays an important role as an anion in percolation water, and regulates water pH in the surface soil. A high proportion of dissolved Al was in the form of organic complexes. Total dissolved Al levels were well below the toxic limits for pine.																	0049-6979					JAN	1995	79	1-4					191	200		10.1007/BF01100437						WOS:A1995QU75300012

The effect of natural dissolved organic matter (NDOM, <0.1 mg/L or 15 mg/L) found in groundwater was investigated. While the pH was found to greatly affect the adsorption of PCP, the adsorption rate was not affected by NDOM at either pH 5.4 or pH 6.3. For a low concentration range (PCP <0.4 nmol/mL), the effect of NDOM on PCP adsorption isotherms was negligeable at pH 5.2, 5.4, and 6.1. The breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained from displacement studies were fitted to the analytical solution of a one-dimensional transport model that assumes a linear isotherm. The BTCs (pH 6.2-6.5) showed that NDOM do not affect the retardation factor for PCP. However, PCP adsorption isotherms obtained from a higher concentration range (PCP <3 nmol/mL) showed that NDOM may increase the adsorption of PCP on soil at pH 5.4 and 6.1.																	0013-936X					DEC	1994	28	13					2314	2320		10.1021/es00062a015						WOS:A1994PV17100018	22176049

Absorption and fluorescence parameters for these samples are reported. For surface waters, variations in the fluorescence quantum yields obtained with 355- and 337-nm excitation fell within a narrow window (<2.5-fold variation about the mean values), demonstrating that fluorescence measurements can be used to determine absorption coefficients of CDOM in the ultraviolet region with reasonably good accuracy. Methods for predicting absorption coefficients and line shapes from the fluorescence data are introduced and tested. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of CDOM extracted from some seawaters differed significantly from those of the original waters, demonstrating that material isolated by hydrophobic adsorption is not necessarily representative of the suite of colored organic matter present in aquatic systems. These results clearly illustrate that great care must be taken when extracted material is used to infer the optical properties of natural waters.

J	LEHMAN, RM; MILLS, AL				LEHMAN, RM; MILLS, AL			FIELD EVIDENCE FOR COPPER MOBILIZATION BY DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER	WATER RESEARCH												Fluxes of copper from the sediments to the water column in response to the presence of dissolved organic matter were measured in field enclosures placed on the floor of the Contrary Creek arm of Lake Anna, Virginia. Experimental chambers received a spike input of either sodium humate or phytoplankton; unamended chambers served as controls. Over the subsequent five days, water samples were withdrawn from the chambers and analyzed for total and dissolved copper, total and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) Eh, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved sulfides and heterotrophic microbial activity. Chambers amended with phytoplankton did not experience a rise in dissolved copper concentrations. Furthermore, the concentrations of dissolved copper in these chambers were not well-correlated with DOC concentrations (r = 0.1175, P = 0.642). Dissolved copper concentrations in chambers amended with sodium humate rose approximately 500% and remained elevated for the duration of the experimental trial (5 days). In this treatment, dissolved copper concentrations were well-correlated with DOC concentrations (r = 0.798, P < 0.005). The increase in dissolved copper in the chambers amended with sodium humate was observed to persist despite reducing conditions which were confirmed by redox measurements and the occurrence of dissolved sulfides. The addition of sodium humate to the chamber water resulted in a net mobilization of copper to the water column from the sediments. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon generated by the decomposition of phytoplankton did not appear to mobilize copper over the time interval examined. None of the changes in soluble copper concentrations could be related to Eh or pH effects. Supplementary laboratory experiments corroborated the field trials. The results suggest that long term (but not short term) products of decomposition processes may enhance the concentration of dissolved copper in the water column by the formation of soluble organometallic complexes.																	0043-1354					DEC	1994	28	12					2487	2497		10.1016/0043-1354(94)90067-1						WOS:A1994PP84500008

DOC concentrations were about 9-12 mg l(-1) during base flow in summer and winter. High flow episodes during rain storms in summer and autumn were characterized by considerably increased concentrations of DOC, while concentrations increased only slightly during the snow melting period in spring. Seasonal variations in C:N-ratios and charge density of the DOC suggest that DOM during base flow and the spring discharge peak consist of well-decomposed material generated mainly from deeper pear layers, while DOM in the summer and autumn episodes is less decomposed, more acidic, organic material derived from surficial organic soil layers.																	0003-9136					NOV	1994	132	1					45	55								WOS:A1994PW43300003

Tests with different ion exchange resins demonstrated that under low ionic strength conditions (0.01 mol/kg) and in the presence of DOM, equilibration times of at least 24 h are required for experiments with Cu(II). The classical approach to the EIM was modified by using nonlinear reference adsorption isotherms in order to expand the method to a broader range of experimental conditions. For Cu(II) at low ionic strength (0.01 mol/kg), the reference isotherms between pH 4 and 6 were identical and were mathematically modeled in terms of Langmuir adsorption parameters. The EIM using nonlinear reference isotherms was Validated between pH 4 and 6 by the correct determination of the stability constants for the complexes CuOxalate and Cu(Oxalate)(2). Then the method was used to quantitatively characterize the Cu(II) complexation behavior of DOM in an aqueous chestnut leaf litter extract between pH 4 and 6. In contrast to the classical approach to the EIM, data were analyzed by using plots [Cu](bound)/[Cu](free) vs: [Cu](bound). This allowed the determination of both, conditional stability constants and metal binding capacities for two different binding site classes. The logarithmic values of the stability constants were about 8 for the strong binding sites and 5.5-6 for the weak binding sites.

A large portion (32%) of the hydrophobic fraction could not be eluted by standard procedures. Only after severe hydrolysis and further extraction was it possible to recover most of this material. These findings indicate that usual XAD-2 fractionation methods may result in large underestimates of the hydrophobic fraction of PDOC.

Although, including all data, bacterial abundance correlated with chlorophyll a (r = 0.49), the bacteria/ phytoplankton carbon ratio decreased in the core of the Atlantic jet. Bacterial integrated secondary production ranged from 124 to 199 mg C m-2 d-1. Bacterial generation times averaged 3.2 d (S.D. = 1.3) in frontal sites above the pycnocline and 25 d (S.D. = 11) under the pycnocline. In the adjacent Mediterranean waters, bacterial generation times displayed homogenous values from the surface to 150 m (mean 2.7 d; S.D. = 1.5). An isolated Atlantic water mass, at the right side of the jet, showed the longest average bacterial generation times (9.5 d). In the chlorophyll maximum layers, percent extracellular release represented 23.5% of total net primary production in the oligotrophic sites and only 6.5% in the core of the Atlantic jct. The contribution of PDOC to bacterial production exhibited large variations (17-100%). Dissimilarities among sites and hydrodynamical structures of the water masses were mostly observed in bacterial generation times and phytoplankton extracellular release.

J	HOEGHGULDBERG, O				HOEGHGULDBERG, O			UPTAKE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER BY LARVAL STAGE OF THE CROWN-OF-THORNS STARFISH ACANTHASTER PLANCI	MARINE BIOLOGY												The life-history of the crown-of thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) includes a planktotrophic larva that is capable of feeding on particulate food. It has been proposed, however, that particulate food (e.g. microalgae) is scarce in tropical water columns relative to the nutritional requirements of the larvae of A. planci, and that periodic shortages of food play an important role in the biology of this species. It has also been proposed that non-particulate sources of nutrition (e.g. dissolved organic matter, DOM) may fuel part of the nutritional requirements of the larval development of A, planci as well. The present study addresses the ability of A, planci larvae to take up several DOM species and compares rates of DOM uptake to the energy requirements of the larvae. Substrates transported in this study have been previously reported to be transported by larval asteroids from temperate and antarctic waters. Transport rates (per larval A, planci) increased steadily during larval development and some substrates had among the highest mass-specific transport rates ever reported for invertebrate larvae. Maximum transport rates (J(max)(in)) for alanine increased from 15.5 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) (13.2 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1)) for gastrulas (J(max)(in) = 38.7 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) or 47.4 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1)) to 35.0 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) (13.1 pmol mu(-1) h(-1)) for early brachiolaria (J(max)(in) just prior to settlement = 350.0 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) or 161.1 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1)) at 1 mu M substrate concentrations. The instantaneous metabolic demand for substrates by gastrula, bipinnaria and brachiolaria stage larvae could be completely satisfied by alanine concentrations of 11, 1.6 and 0.8 mu M, respectively. Similar rates were measured in this study for the essential amino acid leucine, with rates increasing from 11.0 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) (or 9.4 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1)) for gastrulas (J(max)(in) = 110.5 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) or 94.4 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1)) to 34.0 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) (or 13.0 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1)) for late brachiolaria (J(max)(in) = 288.9 pmol larva(-1) h(-1) or 110.3 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1)) at 1 mu M substrate concentrations. The essential amino acid histidine was transported at lower rates (1.6 pmol mu g(-1) h(-1) at 1 mu M for late brachiolaria). Calculation of the energy contribution of the transported species revealed that larvae of A, planci can potentially satisfy 0.6, 18.7, 29.9 and 3.3% of their total energy requirements (instantaneous energy demand plus energy added to larvae as biomass) during embryonic and larval development from external concentrations of 1 mu M of glucose, alanine, leucine and histidine, respectively. These data demonstrate that a relatively minor component of the DOM pool in seawater (dissolved free amino acids, DFAA) can potentially provide significant amounts of energy for the growth and development of A. planci during larval development.

J	HEIKKINEN, K				HEIKKINEN, K			ORGANIC-MATTER, IRON AND NUTRIENT TRANSPORT AND NATURE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN THE DRAINAGE-BASIN OF A BOREAL HUMIC RIVER IN NORTHERN FINLAND	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					International Conference on Organic Substances in Soil and Water	SEP 14-17, 1992	LANCASTER, ENGLAND					Organic carbon and iron transport into the Gulf of Bothnia and the seasonal changes in the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were studied in 1983 and 1984 at the mouth of the River Kiiminkijoki, which crosses an area of minerotrophic mires in northern Finland. Organic and inorganic transport within the drainage basin was studied in the summer and autumn of 1985 and 1986, and information was also acquired on the nature of DOM by gel filtration in river, brook and peat mining water. The river water is organically coloured, with high organic matter, Fe concentrations and transport rates, while the values for phosphorus and nitrogen are low. The organic carbon concentrations increase with discharge with the major organic load restricted to the time of spring floods. The results indicate that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is mainly of terrestrial origin, leaching mostly from peatlands. Autochthonous DOC sources seem also to be important in summer. The DOC concentrations decrease under low flow conditions probably mainly due to sedimentation and decomposition of humic substances. The proportion of drifting algae as a particulate organic carbon (POC) source seems to increase in summer. The changes in the ratio of Fe/DOC, the colour of the DOM and the ratio of fluorescence to DOC with discharge give indications of the origin, formation, nature and fate of the DOM in the river water. Temperature-dependent microbiological processes in the formation and sedimentation of Fe-organic colloids seem to be important. Estimates are given for the amounts and transport rates of organic carbon and Fe discharged into the Gulf of Bothnia by river. High apparent molecular weight (HAMW) organic colloids are important for the organic, Fe and P transport in the basin. The gel filtration data suggest that the DOM in the water consists mainly of fulvic acids, although humic acids are also important. The apparent molecular weight of the DOM is higher than in the lakes in the area of ombrotrophic peatlands in southern Finland. Colour in this humic water increases with DOC and Fe concentrations. The results indicate an increase in the mobilization of HAMW Fe-organic colloids in the peatlands following drainage and peat mining. The transport of inorganic nitrogen from the peatlands in the area and in the river is increasing due to peat mining. The corresponding changes in the transport of organic matter, Fe and P are less marked but point in a similar direction.																	0048-9697					JUL 25	1994	152	1					81	89		10.1016/0048-9697(94)90553-3						WOS:A1994NX45200010

The resins were arranged in varying sequences, which proved to be critical for determining the efficiency of DOC isolation. The sequence XAD7/2/4 allowed the isolation of a very high percentage of DOC (65%) from the seawater matrix. A mixed bed of the same resins showed a significantly lower recovery (39%). Varying amounts of the material adsorbed by the individual resins could not be recovered by NaOH/methanol elution. The percentage of DOC firmly retained by each resin was 32, 21, and 2% in XAD2, XAD4, and XAD7, respectively.

The highest concentrations occurred in the coastal areas, and there was a marked trend with decreasing concentrations towards the inland and the mountain range further west. Explanation of these differences are regional differences in forestland productivity, the occurrence and type of peatlands, annual runoff patterns and soil drainage conditions. Anthropogenic factors, such as atmospheric deposition of acids and forestry, have probably not contributed to the regional differences.																	0018-8158					JUN 24	1994	286	1					37	51		10.1007/BF00007279						WOS:A1994NZ87800004		
J	AMON, RMW; BENNER, R				AMON, RMW; BENNER, R			RAPID-CYCLING OF HIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN THE OCEAN	NATURE												DISSOLVED organic matter (DOM) in the ocean is one of the largest active reservoirs of organic carbon on Earth. It is important to understand the processes by which DOM is recycled, particularly as changes in the oceanic DOM pool could affect atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on timescales of 1,000 to 10,000 years (ref. 1). It is commonly believed that low-molecular-weight material, which comprises 65-80% of DOM(2-5), is rapidly remineralized, and that high-molecular-weight material is refractory. But the average age of DOM in the deep ocean is about 6,000 years (ref. 6) which implies that a large proportion of the DOM cycles only very slowly. Here we present a study of the relative bioavailability of low- and high-molecular weight DOM in water samples taken from the northern Gulf of Mexico during a diatom bloom. Bacterial growth and respiration in the presence of high-molecular-weight DOM were respectively three and six times greater than for low-molecular-weight material. Although both of these pools undoubtedly contain mixtures of compounds with varying reactivities and turnover times, our results demonstrate that the bulk of oceanic DOM comprises small molecules that cycle slowly and are relatively unavailabe to microorganisms.

Flagellates were incubated either with C-14-labeled bacteria or with inorganic C-14, in, order to compare organic exudates originating from primary production with exudates originating from ingested bacteria. Colloids of >0.02 mu m constituted a larger fraction of the exudates originating from ingested bacteria, compared with exudates derived from primary production. Flagellate feeding on bacteria specifically labeled in different cell components was compared. Cell wall components gave rise to less colloidal organic carbon than did other cell constituents. To investigate the degradability of flagellate C-14-exudates, they were added to lake water and mineralization to (CO2)-C-14 was monitored. Bacterially derived exudates were more recalcitrant than exudates originating from photosynthesis. The results support the hypothesis that bacterial utilization of labile organic compounds, followed by flagellate bacterivory and exudation, results in a transformation of labile organic matter into more recalcitrant forms.

The composition of aggregates did not reflect that of either the macrophyte or the soluble material from which they were derived and did not vary with species. These results, coupled with the fact that aggregate composition was similar to that reported for bacteria, support the hypothesis that the process of aggregation was largely driven by microbial processes. The composition of morphous detritus (recognizable fragments of decomposing macrophytes) did vary with species and was related to that of the initial macrophyte. Morphous detritus had higher C: N ratios and was lower in protein than aggregates. The composition of aggregates was also different than that reported for marine snow.																	0024-3590					MAY	1994	39	3					717	723								WOS:A1994NT26400021

These were collected near urban outfalls and a river month in the Mediterranean, having a high interstitial dissolved organic carbon content (DOC). A self-made experimental laser-crystal fluorimeter and two classical spectrofluorimeters are employed (Perkin Elmer LS-2 and LS-50). For an excitation wavelength at 366 nm, a definite emission ''bump'' is found for LS-2 and LS-50, which is caused by specific fluorophores. Two kinds of curves are reported with the experimental laser, the ''laser induced fluorescence'' produced at a fixed time (LIF) and the ''time resolved emission spectra'' (TRES), which are three dimensional space graphs. Photochemical decay of fluorescent organic matter (FOM) results in an almost exponential decrease of the complete LIF spectrum. A correlation exists between two peaks of the spectra, the broad band around 475 nm and the narrow peak at 720 nm, depending on DOC. The emission spectra (EFS, LIF, TRES) are systematically compared with three different factors, being filtration, pH and added aluminium ion. (1) filtration affects the fluorescence of organic matter by minimizing the scattering interference. (2) pH affects the ''fine structure'' of the broad band around 475 nm. As concerning the increase at 530 nm at stronger pH, one can consider that there is a competition between H+ ion and other cationic species: the anionic form favors the formation of chelate species. This is due to stereostructural changes of FOM, involving neutral, anionic or chelate species. (3) Aluminium enhances fluorecence intensities near 530 nm, which is attributed to a colloidal organo-aluminium complex formation. Additions of Al3+ in excess, at constant salinity, result in essential modifications of the equilibrium between spheroidal and unfolded geometries of FOM. Since a decreasing intensity of this ''bump'' at 530 nm is observed after re-filtration, this confirms the possible colloidal state of the Al-FOM complex. Emission fluorescent spectra (EFS) obtained by LS-2 due to Al3+ addition, at natural pH and natural salinity, are treated with a linear regression method; an apparent stability constant is calculated at 530 nm, K = 3.58.																	0304-4203					APR	1994	46	1-2					7	23		10.1016/0304-4203(94)90041-8						WOS:A1994NF58500002

Correlation between the hydrated electrons generated and dissolved organic carbon in seawaters was found. The DOM in land waters ejected more hydrated electrons than seawater DOM did. Land waters contained much natural fluorescent organic matter, so the DOM in the land waters was rich in photochemically sensitive chromophores. Quenching of the hydrated electrons by the inorganic ions, nitrite, nitrate, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and [Co(NH3)6]3+ were investigated by a first-order function and the Stern-Volmer model. With the former, the quenching rate constants were 10(-9) to 10(-10) dm3 mol-1 s-1, which was close to reported values. No regional differences were found among the seawater samples. This result suggested similar quenching mechanisms for hydrated electrons generated in the different seawaters. With the Stern-Volmer model, primary quenching was estimated. Quenching studies of land waters suggested that DOM had an aggregate nature in such waters.																	0009-2673	1348-0634				MAR	1994	67	3					720	727		10.1246/bcsj.67.720						WOS:A1994NE76200018

With batch studies, the relationship between the distribution coefficient (K(d)) for terbuthylazine (2-chloro-4-tert-butylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine) and the water extractable organic material (WEOM) was investigated. In 2 of the soils no relationship could be determined. In the third soil, a highly significant statistical relationship was present. However, the coefficient of determination was less than 20%, and sensitivity analysis with an advection-dispersion transport model indicated that other factors such as the Ap horizon thickness and persistence half-life were theoretically quantitatively more important in the prediction of groundwater contamination risk. Therefore, it was concluded that WEOM is usually not a critical factor in our ability to predict groundwater contamination by non-ionic pesticides with water solubilities on the order of 10 mg/L. An intriguing question remains unanswered. Why was the affinity of terbuthylazine for the soil's organic matter so variable?																	0045-6535					FEB	1994	28	3					533	541		10.1016/0045-6535(94)90296-8						WOS:A1994MZ35000008

DOC fluxes are highest in all compartments at the Hohe Matzen site, which receives the highest amounts of acid deposition. At this site, the pronounced DOM mobilization in the forest floor (31.7 kmol C ha(-1) y(-1)) goes along with a net N-tot and SO42- release, thus indicating humus disintegration. Structural chemical investigations suggest that DOM mobilization in the forest floor is mainly controlled by microbial activity. The high N deposition at Hohe Matzen (2.3 kmol N-tot ha(-1) y(-1)) generally stimulates microbial activity as shown by the elevated mobilization of microbial carbohydrates. From CuO oxidation data and field-ionization mass spectra, iris hypothesized that a second effect of the high N loadings is the retardation of ligninolysis by white-rot fungi and the accumulation of soft-rot degradation products. The latter have been shown in the literature to react with organic N-compounds and to be highly water-soluble. In the mineral soil, DOM is retained mainly by sorption and precipitation processes. Most important for an effective DOM retention are high contents of pedogenic Fe and Al oxides/hydroxides. According to pyrolysis data, high molecular compounds are selectively retained in the B horizons. Blockade of sorption sites by formerly adsorbed DOM and SO42- can reduce sorption capacity for DOM. At the Hohe Matzen site, the Bh horizon grows downwards the profile due to progressive saturation of the sorption sites by DOM and SO42-, and due to depletion of pedogenic Fe and Al by buffering processes. The reduced DOM retention is also expressed by the breakthrough of high molecular compounds at Hohe Matzen.																	0160-4120						1994	20	1					31	41		10.1016/0160-4120(94)90064-7						WOS:A1994MU01800005		
J	SALONEN, K; VAHATALO, A				SALONEN, K; VAHATALO, A			PHOTOCHEMICAL MINERALIZATION OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN LAKE SKJERVATJERN	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Photochemical mineralisation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of a moderately humic lake was studied in 0.1 or 0.2 mum filtered water incubated in glass and quartz bottles. The direct measurement of mineralisation as an increase of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) proved to be a very useful tool when the concentration of DIC is low. At the lake surface, photochemical mineralisation was considerably higher in quartz than glass bottles indicating that UV light is the most important mineraliser of DOM. Because the glass bottles penetrated light well down to 340-350 nm vawelength, the photochemically most intensive part of solar radiation was in the range of UV-B. Higher photochemical mineralisation of DOM in hypolimnetic than in epilimnetic water, irrespective from the small difference in the concentration of DOM, and in water seeping to the lake suggested that photolabile DOM in the epilimnion may slowly become depleted. The results support the hypothesis that photochemical degradation of DOM is an important and predictable factor in the carbon cycling of humic lakes. In addition, photochemical production of low molecular weight substances probably further enhances the mineralisation of DOM and deserves evaluation in humic lakes with a large pool of recalcitrant DOM.																	0160-4120						1994	20	3					307	312		10.1016/0160-4120(94)90114-7						WOS:A1994NM12900006

Molecular models of DOM derived from allochthonous and autochthonous sources show that short-chain, branched, and alicyclic structures are terminated by carboxyl or methyl groups in DOM from both sources. Allochthonous DOM, however, had aromatic structures indicative of tannin and lignin residues, whereas the autochthonous DOM was characterized by aliphatic alicyclic structures indicative of lipid hydrocarbons as the source. DOM isolated from different morphoclimatic regions had minor structural differences.																	0065-2393		0-8412-2526-5				1994	237						195	221								WOS:A1994BZ52H00007

Three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of natural waters were used to determine the solar-stimulated emission as a function of depth in the water column. Inclusion of the wavelength-dependent fluorescence quantum yield provides emission values in absolute units of photons s-1 cm-2 5 nm-1. Attenuation of light in the water column was also modeled, allowing determination of total upwelled emission. The upwelled fluorescence is compared to irradiance reflectance calculated from a semianalytical model. The fluorescence contribution to reflectance in the blue-green to green region can be as high as 70% for blackwater but is rapidly reduced by the introduction of scattering particles. Except for blackwaters, CDOM fluorescence does not significantly affect irradiance reflectance ratios commonly used in remote-sensing applications. In water with moderate amounts of CDOM (absorption coefficient at 355 nm greater-than-or-equal-to 0.5 m-1), fluorescence will dominate water Raman scattering as a secondary influence on the light field in the green spectral region.

J	CHEN, RF; BADA, JL				CHEN, RF; BADA, JL			THE FLUORESCENCE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN POREWATERS OF MARINE-SEDIMENTS	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The fluorescence of porewaters from marine sediment cores from six different areas was measured. In most cases, fluorescence was affected primarily by the diagenesis of organic carbon first through sulfate reduction and subsequently by methane generation. Typically, fluorescence, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), absorbance, alkalinity, and ammonium ion concentrations correlate quite well, increasing in the upper sections of anoxic sediments and co-varying in deeper sections of these cores. The good correlation of DOC with fluorescence in the three cores in which DOC was measured indicates that fluorescence can be used to make a first order estimate of DOC concentration in anoxic porewaters. Data are consistent with a model in which labile organic matter in the sediments is broken down by sulfur reducing bacteria to low molecular weight monomers. These monomers are either remineralized to CO2 or polymerize to form dissolved, fluorescent, high molecular weight molecules. The few exceptions to this model involve hydrothermally generated hydrocarbons that are formed in situ in the Guaymas Basin or are horizontally advected along the decollement in the Nankai Trench.																	0304-4203					JAN	1994	45	1-2					31	42		10.1016/0304-4203(94)90089-2						WOS:A1994MT51000003

J	GUGGENBERGER, G; ZECH, W; SCHULTEN, HR				GUGGENBERGER, G; ZECH, W; SCHULTEN, HR			FORMATION AND MOBILIZATION PATHWAYS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER - EVIDENCE FROM CHEMICAL STRUCTURAL STUDIES OF ORGANIC-MATTER FRACTIONS IN ACID FOREST FLOOR SOLUTIONS	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is well recognized to influence the geochemistry of ecosystems. This study was conducted to determine the pathways of DOC mobilization in the forest floor of coniferous forests. DOM from the forest floor of two acid forest soils in the Fichtelgebirge (Germany) was fractionated into hydrophobic acids and neutrals, and hydrophilic acids and neutrals. Carbon distribution at both sites was similar: 53 and 52% hydrophobic acids, 23 and 22% hydrophilic acids, 10 and 11% hydrophobic neutrals, and 7 and 8% hydrophilic neutrals, respectively. Structural composition of the DOM fractions was determined using chemical degradation, FT-IR and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, as well as pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry. Results indicate different chemical composition of the DOM fractions within each site. Hydrophobic acids show high concentrations of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, and a high ratio of vanillic acid to vanillin (ca 1.0), both indicating a high degree of biodegradation of plant-derived compounds. Carbohydrates are covalently bound to apolar moieties and from carbohydrate composition a lignocellulose nature of the hydrophobic acid fraction is suggested. Hydrophilic acids can be differentiated from the hydrophobic acids by their higher degree of oxidative biodegradation. The hydrophilic acid fraction also exhibits a higher ratio of microbially released polysaccharides versus plant-derived polysaccharides. Hydrophobic neutrals show the closest relationships to the refractory soil humin, with less degraded dimeric 'condensed' lignin subunits and relatively high contents of non-carbohydrate aliphatics. Hydrophilic neutrals are enriched in carbohydrates mobilized by enzymatic cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown, as well as from microbial origin. We conclude that DOM release into forest floor solution is related to microbial activity by oxidative degradation of plant-derived organic matter (e.g. water-soluble lignin and lignocellulose fragments) and by production of microbial metabolites (e.g. polysaccharides). Overall evidence suggests that hydrophobic acids (i) represent intermediates in organic matter decomposition, which can be further degraded to hydrophilic acids and CO2, and (ii) are precursors of humic substances in illuvial horizons after precipitation/adsorption.																	0146-6380					JAN	1994	21	1					51	66		10.1016/0146-6380(94)90087-6						WOS:A1994MY37200005

Stopped-flow method and fluorescence technique were used to measure Cu(II)-DOM complexation over time. Suwannee River reference fulvic acid and water soluble soil organic matter were used as model DOM. Experimental conditions of pH 6, 5 x 10(-5) M Cu(II), and 5 mg C/L of DOM were used and the results were to simulate the relevant natural conditions. Both organic ligands reacted fairly rapidly with Cu(II). Reaction half-life of DOM was in the millisecond range. Two types of metal binding sites of organic ligands were identified. Fulvic acid yield forward rate constants: 1 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and 5.15 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1), based on second-order reaction rate model. Water soluble soil organic matter gave forward rate constants: 1.34 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) and 2.2 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1). From comparison of kinetic natures, the fast-reacting ligands were comparable to nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and slow-reacting ligands were more like salcylic acid.																	0277-2248						1994	43	1-2					1	12		10.1080/02772249409358012						WOS:A1994QB96600001

Findings were as follows. (1) The fluorescent components of dissolved organic matter (FDOM) are present in easily measurable quantities from near shore to well over 300 km offshore in the SCB and are likewise easily measurable in the coastal, shelf, slope, and Gulf Stream waters of the MAB. (2) The range of FDOM in the MAB is considerably greater than that in the SCB. (3) The lowest FDOM levels observed in the SCB were higher than those found in the Gulf Stream. (4) The onshore-to-offshore spatial gradient of the FDOM was found to be considerably lower in the SCB than in the MAB, with the highest levels of FDOM being found immediately adjacent to the coast in the MAB. This suggests that the water adjacent to the SCB shoreline is not as strongly influenced by terrestrial and estuarine sources of FDOM as the MAB is. (5) The spatial distribution of the FDOM within both the SCB and the MAB is frequently coherent with the spatial distribution of chlorophyll determined from the concurrent airborne-laser-induced phytoplankton pigment fluorescence measurements. However, distinct noncoherency is sometimes observed, especially at water mass boundaries.

Four fractions have been isolated and their fluorescence emission spectra, fluorescence excitation spectra and their fluorescence quantum efficiencies were compared with those of macroporous XAD8 and XAD4 extracts isolated from the same water samples. A clear one to one correspondence between the ultrafiltrated fractions and the resin extracts was observed which indicates that the two methods lead to isolate very similar type of organic material. The ''apparent'' mean molecular weights deduced for humic, fulvic and hydrophilic acids appear consistent with previous values drawn from waters of various origins. Moreover, by using the fluorescence spectra characterizing each of these acids we have been able to estimate the contribution of their respective fluorescence to the total fluorescence spectra of the two studied crude water samples.																	0959-3330					DEC	1993	14	12					1131	1144								WOS:A1993MM50800003

A number of oceanic carbon cycle models have failed to reproduce the 30% increase in CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) during the last deglaciation as reconstructed from polar ice cores. We apply therefore this approach of exploring the model's parameter space to examine the effect of long-lived dissolved organic matter on the system. The results from the two models complement each other, in terms of insight versus detail. Carbon is usually assumed to be transported from the surface into the deep ocean through the sedimentation of particulate matter. If there exists in the ocean a pool of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with a regeneration time comparable with the advection time, then the associated carbon can also be advected, resulting in a different distribution. Such a DOM reservoir acts as a smoother on the spatial distribution of nutrients in the sea, particularly in the equatorial intermediate waters. We establish the role of intermediate waters as one of the key components of the oceanic carbon cycle and show that DOM reduces the sensitivity of the carbon cycle to oceanic circulation pattern changes, mainly because of its smoothing effect. Consequently, the possible existence of DOM species with a time constant of the order of a century tends to reduce, rather than enhance, the glacial-interglacial difference in pCO2 levels due to changes in the thermohaline circulation.

We present a protocol for the determination of CDOM fluorescence that will allow both interlaboratory comparisons and the calibration of airborne fluorescence measurements. This protocol is based on the use of the water Raman signal as an internal radiometric standard and quinine sulfate as an external standard. This study demonstrates that when an appropriate and consistent procedure is used to standardize fluorescence measurements, the fluorescence per unit absorption exhibits surprisingly little variation for diverse waters. The maximum variability observed between all sites was 36% and within the western North Atlantic the variability was only 12%. Algorithms are presented for retrieval of the absorption coefficient of CDOM at 355 and 337 nm from shipboard or airborne measurements of the water-Raman-normalized fluorescence emission resulting from 355- and 337-nm excitation.

Uptake of all compounds occurred in darkness, but was frequently enhanced under natural illumination. The photosystem 2 inhibitor, 343,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU) generally failed to inhibit light-stimulated DOM uptake. Occasionally, light plus DCMU-amended treatments led to uptake rates higher than light-incubated samples, possibly due to phototrophic bacteria present in subsurface anoxic layers. Uptake was similar with either H-3- or C-14-labeled substrates, indicating that recycling of labeled CO2 via photosynthetic fixation was not interfering with measurements of light-stimulated DOM uptake. Microautoradiographs showed a variety of pigmented and nonpigmented bacteria and, to a lesser extent, cyanobacteria and eucaryotic microalgae involved in light-mediated DOM uptake. Light-stimulated DOM uptake was often observed in bacteria associated with sheaths and mucilage surrounding filamentous cyanobacteria, revealing a close association of organisms taking up DOM with photoautotrophic members of the mat community. The capacity for dark- and light-mediated heterotrophy, coupled to efficient retention of fixed carbon in the mat community, may help optimize net production and accretion of mats, even in oligotrophic waters.

Growth efficiencies were determined from direct measurements of particulate organic carbon (POC) produced and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) used. On average, 6% of the DOC was consumed during growth m batch cultures. Depending on sampling locality, the DOC consumed was converted to bacterial biomass with efficiencies ranging from 26 to 61%. The efficiency did not correlate with either concentration of DOC or temperature. In continuous flow cultures, growth efficiency increased progressively with increasing ammonium concentration but decreased with increasing substrate C : N ratio. These results suggest that the C : N ratio of the substrate can be a major determinant of bacterial growth efficiency and that differences in growth efficiency between sampling stations can be attributed to differences in the concentration of usable N in the substrate.

For both sites hydrophobic acids (HoS), hydrophilic acids (HiS), hydrophobic neutrals (HoN), hydrophilic neutrals (HiN), and hydrophilic bases (HiB) are discriminated concerning their dynamics in the compartments. Most of the HiN and HoN are mobilized by leaching from the forest canopy. Both neutral fractions are netto retained in the forest floor as well as in the mineral soil. In contrast, HoS and HiS are mainly released in the organic layers with a total input of organic acids from the forest floor into the mineral soil of ca 100 kg C (HoS) ha-1 a-1, and 50 kg C (HiS) ha-1 a-1. respectively. HoS are selectively better retained in the mineral horizons, leading to a mineral soil output of 2.4 - 4.4 kg C (HoS) ha-1 a-1, and 2.7 - 6.5 kg C (HiS) ha-1 a-1, respectively.

J	TRANVIK, LJ				TRANVIK, LJ			MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATION OF LABILE DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER INTO HUMIC-LIKE MATTER IN SEAWATER	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Microbial transformation of labile, low molecular weight dissolved organic matter (DOM) into dissolved humic matter (DHM) was studied in seawater. Surface water samples were amended with [C-14]glucose, and the partitioning of C-14 into (CO2)-C-14 (TOC)-C-14 (total organic C-14), and (POC)-C-14 (particulate organic C-14), was measured over time in confined samples. The humic and non-humic fractions of (DOC)-C-14 (dissolved organic C-14) were separated according to a common operational definition of DHM based on adsorption on XAD-8 macroporous resin. Both (TOC)-C-14 and non-humic (DOC)-C-14 decreased during the experiments. However, C-14-labelled DHM increased during the first week of the incubations, to a level where it comprised 15% of the (TOC)-C-14 remaining in the samples, or 3% of the initially added C-14. Towards the end of experiments (ca 70 days), the humic fraction of (DOC)-C-14 gradually approached the background level of poisoned control samples. Provided that the XAD-8 operational definition of DHM is accepted, this study indicates that humic matter may be formed in seawater within days from labile monomers such as glucose.

Based on fractionation, the humic substances in the B horizons showed typical characteristics for the podzolic B horizon and no significant differences were detected among the soil or vegetation types. The contents of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl functional groups of the fulvic acids which corresponded to about 5 and 1 mmol g-1 organic matter, respectively, were lower than the reported values of soil fulvic acids in cool and temperate zones. According to H-1-NMR analysis, the fulvic acids from litter extracts and soil solutions were considered to consist of mixtures of polyphenols, aliphatic acids, and/or polysaccharides. In contrast, those from the soils consisted of polyphenols with a high degree of substitution by relatively short aliphatic or saccharide chains. Thus, it was considered that the fulvic acids in this area, especially those from soil solutions and litter extracts, exhibited a low metal-chelating capacity and played a certain role in pedogenesis through the supply of protons. On the other hand, the content of dissociated acidic functional groups of dissolved organic matter in the soil solution was about 2.2 mmol(-) g-1 organic matter as estimated from the DOC concentration and anion deficit in the soil solution. It was considered that acidic functional groups were not fully saturated with metal ions. The dynamics of dissolved organic matter with certain negative charges in the profiles was considered to be controlled by the adsorbing capacity of amorphous compounds of Al and Fe in the soil solid phase, which had previously been translocated mainly as inorganic forms. The amorphous compounds derived through these processes in the illuvial B horizons were often rich in compounds which did not form complexes with organic matter compared to the surface horizons, and the organo-mineral compounds showed a low molar ratio of acidic functional groups of humus/metal ions.																	0038-0768					MAR	1993	39	1					169	181								WOS:A1993KT99400018

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated from Jack Lake, Ontario (JL-DOM), and separated into four size fractions. A sample of fibrils from Lake St. George, Ontario, and two model substances, pectin and polygalacturonic acid, represented DOM of algal origin. Chlamydomonas reinhardii was included as a source of particulate organic matter for comparison. Daphnia magna (less-than-or-equal-to 48 and less-than-or-equal-to 24 h old) was exposed to treatments of fenvalerate plus these sources of DOM. The end point of the static 48-h bioassays was the inability of daphnids to swim during a 10-s period after gentle prodding. Results from treatments with JL-DOM (10 x natural concentrations) and fibrils (4 mg/L) were analyzed independently. The EC50 of fenvalerate plus >0.2 mum JL-DOM (0.22 mug/L) was significantly lower than that of the >10-kD-molecular-weight fraction (1.99 mug/L), but neither was different from fenvalerate alone (0.91 mug/L). There were no significant differences between treatments including lake fibrils, pectin or polygalacturonic acid, or between age groups. No bioassays using Daphnia magna and algal fibrils as a source of DOM have been conducted previously. An adhesion phenomenon occurred between Daphnia magna and the DOM (JL-DOM and fibrils) in the presence of fenvalerate. DOM and fibrils aggregated on the spine and antennae of the daphnids, which impaired the ability of the organisms to swim. Adhesion increased as the concentration of fenvalerate increased but was absent in controls. This phenomenon may confound the results of bioassays that use immobility as an end point. Adhesion could be an important sublethal effect of fenvalerate, affecting daphnid survival and its role as a food source in aquatic systems.																	0730-7268					JAN	1993	12	1					167	176		10.1897/1552-8618(1993)12[167:EOTPAA]2.0.CO;2						WOS:A1993KE02900017

In the liquid fractions organic matter was characterized and some components were identified. The distribution of zinc and copper over MW-classes was determined. In pig slurry-liquid one third of the copper and zinc was found in the mass range > 50,000. After 3 days contact with soil, copper concentration increased and 10 % was found in the nominal molecular mass range 50,000. The zinc concentration did not change, but the MW distribution had shifted in favor of higher molecular masses. Cation exchange experiments (4 hours) with the above fractions showed a zinc exchange rate of 50 % per hour, typically. Copper complexes in HMW-fractions did not exchange, which was tentatively explained by the measured high thermodynamic complex stability. Copper pig slurry-liquid LMW-fractions showed an exchange rate of 25 % per hour; the reaction stopped when 50 % was left, indicating the presence of stable LMW copper species. After incubation with soil the LMW copper showed a constant dissociation rate of 20 % per hour.																	0306-7319						1993	50	2					91	107								WOS:A1993LZ45300003		
J	LEE, C; HENRICHS, SM				LEE, C; HENRICHS, SM			HOW THE NATURE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER MIGHT AFFECT THE ANALYSIS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON	MARINE CHEMISTRY												A discrepancy exists between the low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater measured by 'standard' techniques, such as wet-chemical oxidation, UV photo-oxidation, and dry high-temperature combustion, and the relatively high concentrations measured using new catalyzed, high-temperature combustion methods. One of the factors that could help explain this discrepancy is the nature of the DOC being analyzed. Because little is known about the structure of the bulk of DOC, here we will discuss DOC sources, how sources could affect structure, and how structure as well as chemical factors and sampling procedures might affect analysis of DOC. One likely reason for the discrepancy between the standard and new methods is the presence of a fraction of DOC not previously measured by the standard techniques. This 'new' DOC could consist of refractory, large, highly cross-linked macromolecular organic material, possibly colloidal in nature. Material that incorporates sulfur or specific organic structures which inhibit wet-chemical oxidation or photo-oxidation could also be present. Other possible materials present that might explain the discrepancy are those that are prone to incomplete oxidation because they form unreactive compounds during standard oxidation procedures.

In soft water, humus significantly inhibited particle destabilization. The additional coagulant dosages needed for efficient coagulation corresponded to the dosages required for humus removal from pure solutions. Adsorption of humus onto precipitated hydroxide was regarded as being the major mechanism of interaction here. In hard water, high concentrations of humus seemed to impair aggregation of microflocs. This was attributed to the formation of soluble calcium humate complexes in raw water that may adsorb more slowly on precipitated hydroxide than dissolved humus. Precipitation of phosphate was not affected by humus in a definite way. A clear influence of LAS on coagulation was not found.																	0273-1223						1993	27	11					103	112								WOS:A1993LT91800011

Ferric chloride dosage and pH domains on the iron coaglation diagrams were developed for removal of these humic substances and for determination of the resulting trihalomethane formation potentials (THMFP) of the treated water.

For those studies showing a balanced final budget, the discrepancy between DIN disappearance and PN increase does not appear to be random with time. Those trends imply excretion of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), which can represent up to 75 % of the DIN uptake, in the early part of the incubation, followed by DON uptake when DIN is exhausted. For 4 out of 5 studies in which DON was measured, this variable could account for 91 to 100 % of the missing nitrogen in the final budget.

Distinct southward subsurface fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) within subducted shelf water, cabelled slope water, and overturned basin water are inferred. Within two cases of a positive gradient of DOC(pt) between terrestrial/shelf and offshore stocks, the net equatorward exports of O2 and DOC(pt) from the northern North Atlantic yield molar ratios of 2.1 to 9.1, compared to the expected Redfield O2/C ratio of 1.3. In the first case, 63% of the apparent oxygen utilization demands of the water column may be met by DOC, instead of only 14% in the second scenario, preserving a role for falling particles in the sea. With a DOC/DON ratio of 10, the larger net southward export of DON across 36-degrees-25'N balances the postulated net northward input of 1.7 x 10(3) kg NO3 s-1 of unutilized nitrate within the Gulf Stream. Without an enhanced supply of DOM from the shelves, a zero seaward gradient of DOM in the third case suggests that none of the poleward nitrate flux is returned southward as DON, but instead a net poleward flux of DON prevails as well. Our present estimates are confounded, however, by the seasonal and multiyear variability of sinking processes in the North Atlantic. Future active and passive remote sensors, field programs, and simulation models must now discriminate between particulate and dissolved components of surface color signals to verify the importance of both continental margins and DOM in global biogeochemical cycles.																	0148-0227					OCT 15	1992	97	C10					15625	15637		10.1029/92JC01177						WOS:A1992JT99600014

Differences in isotherm capacities obtained using batch-reactor and column-reactor estimation methods were observed when natural background organic matter and TCE were adsorbed simultaneously onto nonpreloaded GAC. Differences in isotherms derived from the two methods were diminished, however, when the carbon was first preloaded with the background organic matter in a river water in the absence of TCE. Significant increases in isotherm slope were observed with increasing preloading time for GAC of two different particle sizes. Isotherms determined using powdered activated carbon sieved from crushed preloaded GAC had essentially parallel slopes, however, with capacities greater than the parent preloaded GAC over the concentration range of interest.

Even when the initial dissolved zinc is low enough to prevent precipitation of zinc minerals in the column, adsorption processes strongly retard the transport of the metal with respect to water. Organic matter, when dissolved, can significantly increase the mobility of Zn. Small pH variations are as important as organic matter in the control of the solubility and transport of zinc. The adsorption of zinc seems to control, at least partially, the solubility of organic matter (most likely as ternary surface complexes of the form solid-Zn-organics). Dissolved organic matter and pH are therefore master variables for the understanding of zinc transport through river bank sediments.																	0959-3330					JUL	1992	13	7					695	700								WOS:A1992JL02900009

The DOM was endogenous (water soluble and humic compounds directly extracted from soil) or exogenous (water soluble organic matter from compounds applied to soils through agricultural practices: sewage sludge, fermented straw, and farmyard slurry; and two model compounds-tannic acid and an anionic surface active agent). Experiments were conducted to quantify the importance of herbicide sorption in three separate systems: DOM-soil, DOM-herbicide in solution, and DOM-adsorbed herbicide. Herbicide adsorption strongly increased in the presence of water soluble materials from fermented straw, which explained the lowest desorption obtained with this DOM. On the other hand, the water soluble extracts of liquid or solid sludge favored herbicide desorption. Generally, adsorption of the less soluble herbicides (dimefuron and atrazine) was favored when soil was pretreated with DOM, and their adsorption generally decreased when DOM was preincubated with herbicides before soil contact. Opposite effects were generally noted for the most soluble herbicide (carbetamide). A new empirical, two-compartment model provided a good description of desorption isotherms. The first compartment (a linear desorption) was similar for most DOM types. The differences in desorption isotherms were mainly related to the different behavior of the second compartment (an exponential desorption), in which the molecules were more strongly adsorbed.																	0047-2425					JUL-SEP	1992	21	3					359	367								WOS:A1992JG87200009

J	CHEN, RF; BADA, JL				CHEN, RF; BADA, JL			THE FLUORESCENCE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN SEAWATER	MARINE CHEMISTRY												A total of 28 vertical profiles of seawater fluorescence was measured in the Sargasso Sea, the Straits of Florida, the Southern California Borderlands, and the central Pacific Ocean. In all cases, surface seawater fluorescence was low as a result of photochemical bleaching which occurs on the timescale of hours. Fluorescence of deep water was 2-2.5 times higher than that of surface waters, and was constant, implying a long residence time for fluorescent organic matter, possibly of the order of thousands of years. Fluorescence correlates well with nutrients (NO3-, PO43-) in mid-depth waters ( 100-1000 m) in the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific, consistent with results in the central Pacific and the coastal seas of Japan. This suggests that regeneration or formation of fluorescent materials accompanies the oxidation and remineralization of settling organic particles. The various sources and sinks of fluorescent organic matter in the global oceans are assessed. The major sources are particles and in situ formation; rivers, rain, diffusion from sediments, and release from organisms are minor sources. The major sink is photochemical bleaching.																	0304-4203					APR	1992	37	3-4					191	221		10.1016/0304-4203(92)90078-O						WOS:A1992HR09200004

The nature of DOM is poorly understood, in part, because it has been difficult to isolate sufficient amounts of representative material for analysis. Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was shown to recover milligram amounts of > 1000 daltons of DOM from seawater collected at three depths in the North Pacific Ocean. These isolates represented 22 to 33 percent of the total DOM and included essentially all colloidal material. The elemental, carbohydrate, and carbon-type (by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance) compositions of the isolates indicated that the relative abundance of polysaccharides was high (approximately 50 percent) in surface water and decreased to approximately 25 percent in deeper samples. Polysaccharides thus appear to be more abundant and reactive components of seawater DOM than has been recognized.

J	QUALLS, RG; HAINES, BL				QUALLS, RG; HAINES, BL			BIODEGRADABILITY OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN FOREST THROUGHFALL, SOIL SOLUTION, AND STREAM WATER	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												High concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were leached into rainwater passing through the canopy and forest floor of an oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) forest in the southern Appalachian Mountains. More than 95% of this dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON) was removed as water percolated through the soil profile and left the ecosystem in stream water. Our objective was to examine the importance of decomposition in the removal of DOC and DON. Samples of DOM from throughfall, forest floow water, soil water from A and B soil horizons, and stream water were all adjusted to a common initial DOC concentration, inoculated with soil and stream microbes, and incubated in solution for 134 d. In general, only 14 to 33% of the DOC in forest floor, soil solution, and stream samples decomposed during the incubation. The relative order of average decomposition of DOC from the various strata was, from fastest to slowest: throughfall, Oi horizon (forest floor), Oa horizon (forest floor), B horizon, stream, AB horizon, isolated fulvic acid, and upper A horizon. In short, biodegradability of DOM in the ecosystem profile declined vertically from throughfall to the A horizon and then increased with depth. The DON generally did not decay faster than the DOC - results consistent with the idea that hydrolysis of organic N is linked to mineralization of DOC rather than occurring selectively in response to the biochemical need for N. Throughfall DOM could be decomposed during its passage through the upper soil, but decomposition seems too slow to be responsible for the bulk of removal of DON and DOC that occurs in the mineral soil. Adsorption, rather than biodegradation, is more likely responsible for maintaining low DOC substrate concentrations in the mineral soil and preventing its loss into stream water.

J	TRANVIK, LJ				TRANVIK, LJ			ALLOCHTHONOUS DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER AS AN ENERGY-SOURCE FOR PELAGIC BACTERIA AND THE CONCEPT OF THE MICROBIAL LOOP	HYDROBIOLOGIA					SYMP ON DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER IN LACUSTRINE ECOSYSTEMS : ENERGY SOURCE AND SYSTEM REGULATOR	MAY, 1990	UNIV HELSINKI, LAMMI BIOL STN, HELSINKI, FINLAND		UNIV HELSINKI, LAMMI BIOL STN			Substantial evidence exists that allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) can provide an important carbon source for pelagic bacteria. On the other hand, it is implicit in the concept of the 'microbial loop' that the degradation of recalcitrant, allochthonous DOM should be retarded in the pelagic environment, as bacteria able to utilize recalcitrant DOM compounds for slow growth would be out-competed by faster-growing bacteria utilizing more labile DOM compounds. Several possible solutions of this apparent paradox are suggested in this paper, including formation of labile DOM from recalcitrant DOM by e.g. photochemical reactions, and mechanisms enabling the maintenance of a metabolically diverse bacterioplankton. These mechanisms include an explanation analogous to Hutchinson's classical solution to the 'paradox of plankton', and differential mortality of different populations within the bacterioplankton enabled by selective grazing, infections by bacteriophages and predatory bacteria, and spatial micropatchiness.

J	WETZEL, RG				WETZEL, RG			GRADIENT-DOMINATED ECOSYSTEMS - SOURCES AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS	HYDROBIOLOGIA					SYMP ON DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER IN LACUSTRINE ECOSYSTEMS : ENERGY SOURCE AND SYSTEM REGULATOR	MAY, 1990	UNIV HELSINKI, LAMMI BIOL STN, HELSINKI, FINLAND		UNIV HELSINKI, LAMMI BIOL STN			The emergent wetland and littoral components of the land-water zone are functionally coupled by the amounts and types of dissolved organic matter that are released, processed, transported to, and then further processed with in the recipient waters. Operational couplings and integrations in freshwater ecosystems occur along physical and metabolic gradients of a number of scales from micrometer to kilometer dimensions. The operation and turnover of the microbial communities, largely associated with surfaces, generate the metabolic foundations for material fluxes along larger-scale gradients. Because of the predominance of small, shallow freshwater bodies, most dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of lacustrine and riverine ecosystems is derived from photosynthesis of higher plants and microflora associated with detritus, including sediments, and is only augmented by photosynthesis of phytoplankton. As the dissolved organic compounds generated in the wetland and littoral interface regions move toward the open-water regions of the ecosystems, partial utilization effects a selective increase in organic recalcitrance. Even through DOC from allochthonous and from interface sources is more recalcitrant than that produced by planktonic microflora, decomposition of the much larger interface quantities imported to the pelagic zone dominates ecosystem decomposition. The observed high sustained productivity of the land-water interface zone results from extensive recycling of essential resources (nutrients, inorganic carbon) and conservation mechanisms. On the average in lakes and streams, greater than 90 percent of the decomposition in the ecosystem is by bacteria utilizing DOM from non-pelagic sources of primary productivity. In addition to direct mineralization of DOC from non-pelagic sources, many of the organic compounds function indirectly to influence metabolism. New evidence is presented to demonstrate formation of complexes between humic and fulvic organic acids and extracellular enzymes. These complexes inhibit enzyme activity and can be transported within the ecosystem. The complex can be decoupled by mild ultraviolet photolysis with regeneration of enzyme activity in displaced locations.																	0018-8158					FEB 21	1992	229						181	198		10.1007/BF00007000						WOS:A1992HL35400015

Impacts of moss on the metabolism of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton and zooplankton in polyhumic water were investigated in laboratory throughflow systems. Growing Warnstorfia (together with epiphytic algae and bacteria) suppressed the production of planktonic algae but had no clear effect on leucine uptake, and hence bacterial production, or on the decomposition of humic substances. Phenol uptake and mineralization rates, however, were lower in the littoral water than in the pelagial water. Excretion of organic carbon by Warnstorfia, algae or Daphnia longispina (the predominant crustacean in the pelagial water) provided only a minor contribution to bacterial production; therefore, a major contribution had to be from humic substances. A bacterial production efficiency of 31-38% could account for the microbial respiration in the water. The results indicated that bacterial, or detrital matter (originating largely from the littoral zone), could not obviate the need for algal food, and that a great deal of particulate matter in the water was poor or useless food for Daphnia. In all, the bulk of dissolved organic matter in Lake Mekkojarvi was biochemically highly recalcitrant. Our results indicate that humic substances (from watershed or littoral area) which, through bacterial degradation, enter the planktonic food web of the lake are mainly lost through respiration by microorganisms.																	0018-8158					FEB 21	1992	229						199	224		10.1007/BF00007001						WOS:A1992HL35400016

DOM from catchment drainage water as well as from the lake consisted mostly (59-63%) of high molecular weight (HMW) compounds (> 10 000 MW). With excess inorganic nutrients, the growth rate and yield of bacteria were almost identical in all size fractions. However, in < 1000 MW fractions and with glucose added, a longer lag phase occurred. Without added nutrients both the growth rates and biomasses of bacteria decreased towards the smaller size fractions and the percentage of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) used during the experiment and the growth efficiency of bacteria were lower than with excess nutrients. The growth efficiency of bacteria was estimated to vary between 3-66% in different MW fractions, largely depending on the nutrient concentrations, but the highest growth efficiencies were observed in HMW fractions and with glucose. The growth of algae was clearly lowest in the < 1000 MW fraction. In dim light no net growth of algae could be found. In contrast, added nutrients substantially enhanced algal growth and in deionized water with glucose, algae achieved almost the same growth rate and biomass as in higher MW fractions of DOM. The results suggested that bacteria and some algae were favoured by DOM, but protozoans seemed to benefit only indirectly, through bacterial grazing. The utilization of DOM by bacteria and algae was strongly affected by the availability of phosphorus and nitrogen.
