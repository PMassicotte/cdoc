Here we proposed a method for the fractionation of DOM in a wastewater based on solubility and acidic-basic properties. Solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges with reversed phase retention and ion-exchange adsorption capacities, namely MAX and MCX, were used in succession to fractionate a petroleum refinery wastewater into four fractions: hydrophobic acid (HOA), hydrophobic neutral (HON), hydrophobic base (HOB), and hydrophilic substance (HIS) fractions. According to the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, 72.6% (in term of TOC) of DOM was extracted in hydrophobic fractions, in which HON was the most abundant. Hydrophobic extracts were characterized by negative and positive ion electrospray (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), respectively. Compounds with multiple oxygen atoms were predominant in the HOA, which were responded strongly in the negative ESI MS. Nitrogen containing compounds were the major detected species by positive ion ESI in all hydrophobic fractions. The molecular composition of the DOM were discussed based on the FT-ICR MS results. The fractionation provided salt free samples which enables the direct analysis of the fractions by ESI and a deep insight into the molecular composition of DOM in the wastewater. The method is potential for routine evaluation of DOM in industry wastewaters, as well as environmental water samples.																	0039-9140	1873-3573				JAN 1	2017	162						466	473		10.1016/j.talanta.2016.10.064						WOS:000389088700063	27837858

CDOM absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and stable isotope delta C-13 were determined on a seasonal basis in seventeen Chinese inland waters as well as in a series of mixing and photodegradation experiments in the lab. A strong positive linear correlation was recorded between Ic:IT and the ratio of terrestrial humic-like Cl to tryptophan-like C4 (C1 :C4) derived by parallel factor analysis. The r(2) for the linear fitting between I-c:I-T and C1:C4 (r(2) = 0.80) was notably higher than between C1:C4 and other indices tested, including the ratio of CDOM absorption at 250 nm to 365 nm, i.e. alpha(250):alpha(365) (r(2) = 0.09), spectral slope (S275-295) (r(2) = 0.26), spectral slope ratio (S-R) (r(2) = 0.31), the humification index (HIX) (r(2) = 0.47), the recent autochthonous biological contribution index (BIX) (r(2) = 0.27), and a fluorescence index (FI370) (r(2) = 0.07). I-c:I-T exhibited larger variability than the remaining six indices and a closer correlation with stable isotope delta C-13 than that observed for alpha(250):alpha(365), S275-295, S-R, FI370, and BIX during field campaigns. Confirming our field observations, significant correlations were recorded between I-C:I-T and the remaining six indices, and I-c:I-T also demonstrated notably larger variability than the six other indices during our wastewater addition experiment. Compared with HIX, eutrophic water addition and photobleaching substantially decreased I-c:I-T but had no pronounced effect on alpha(250):alpha(365), S275-297, S-R, FI370, and BIX, further suggesting that Ic:IT is the most efficient indicator of the CDOM compositional dynamics.

The gradient levels (0.05, 0.10 and 1.00 mM) of sodium anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonate (AQDS) as a mediator were investigated for their impact on reductive dissolution of As(V) and Fe(III) from arsenic-rich sediment. For the overall performance of AQDS-mediated reductive dissolution on As(V) and Fe(III), a more positive effect resulting from 0.05 mM AQDS was observed compared to 0.10 mM, whereas an inhibitory effect was observed with 1.00 mM. Compared to the biotic supplementation with acetate as electron donors, approximately 13-and 6 -fold increased levels of As(III) were released with 0.05 and 0.10 mM, respectively, compared to 1.00 mM AQDS (107.51 mu g/L), and approximately 4-and 3-fold increased Fe(II) levels (40.72 mg/L) were observed during the same conditions. Multiple-dynamic effects of "bacteria-AQDS-DOM", which result from AQDS, shifted the microbial community and synchronously derived terrestrial DOM, which potentially changes the DOM substrate and complex formation of As(III)-Fe(II)-humic DOM. High-throughput sequencing results indicated an increase in the abundance of metal-reducing bacteria (e.g., Bacillus (>16%), Lactococcus (>13%), Pseudomonas (>4%) and Geobacter (>3%)) when supplemented with 0.05 and 0.10 mM of AQDS. However, a boost increasing the abundance of metal oxidizing bacteria was observed with Alicyclobacillus (>16%), Burkholderia (>7%), and Bradyrhizobium (>5%) upon supplementation with 1.00 mM AQDS. These novel insights have profound environmental implications and significance in terms of engineering, not only for understanding the cycle of As/Fe in sediment biochemical processes but for considering future alternative bioremediation treatments.

Before FT-ICR-MS analysis, isolation, desalination and concentration of DOM are necessary, and solid-phase extraction (SPE) is the most widely applied pretreatment procedure. However, some molecular information is lost using conventional SPE methods. Here, we propose a novel strategy of SPE enrichment using stepwise elution (SPE-SE). Compounds in DOM were divided into three fractions by this SPE-SE procedure according to their polarity and ionization efficiency. The diversity of DOM molecules identified by ESI-FT-ICR-MS using SPE-SE exceeded those using conventional SPE methods by more than 50%. This method is feasible and has the potential to be used as a pretreatment strategy for complex DOM matrixes prior to ESI-FT-ICR-MS analysis, especially for those rich in nitrogenous molecules, carbohydrates, lipids and/or aromatic compounds.

In this study, monthly sampling campaigns were conducted from a reservoir (Daecheong Reservoir, South Korea) and its forested tributaries for five consecutive months (June to October) to examine the variations of DOM composition. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) was applied to track the variations of different fluorescent components within bulk DOM. Selected samples were further separated into hydrophobic (Ho) and hydrophilic (Hi) fractions. Water quality and DOM composition varied greatly with the sampling locations including the upstream and the downstream tributary sites, and the reservoir. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) provided the information on the DOM sources and the potential processes leading to the observed DOM changes. Four of the five fluorescent components, identified by EEM-PARAFAC, were well correlated with the flow rates of the tributaries, suggesting hydrological control on DOM composition. The greatest effects were found on two terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C2). The Ho fraction of DOM was more abundant for the post-storm samples versus the non-storm samples, supporting the important roles of hydrology on the changes in chemical composition of DOM. The amounts of the DOM resin fractions, either Ho or Hi, showed strong relationships with C1 and C2, suggesting that DOM fluorescence could be successfully applied to estimate different DOM chemical constituents in forested watersheds.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2016	23	24					24834	24845		10.1007/s11356-016-7720-z						WOS:000389301700031		
J	Yang, CM; Wang, YL; Jing, YC; Li, JH				Yang, Changming; Wang, Yulai; Jing, Yachao; Li, Jianhua			The impact of land use on riparian soil dissolved organic matter and on streamwater quality on Chongming Island, China	Regional Environmental Change												Riparian wetland controls the transfer of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) to surface water bodies. However, the effects of land use on riparian soil DOM quality and its contribution to aquatic environment are largely unknown. In this study, the amount and composition of water-extracted soil organic matter (WSOM) in riparian wetlands were determined to evaluate the effect of land uses on spatial patterns of WSOM and streamwater quality on Chongming Island, China. The fluorescent properties of WSOM and fluvial DOM were analyzed using EEM spectra-combining PARAFAC model and accurate MS and MS/MS identification. Our findings showed no differences in the riparian WSOC contents between land use types (agricultural land, natural wetland, commercial land and industrial land). However, the fluorescent WSOM and its humic-like (Comp.1 and Comp.2) and microbial degradation (Comp.4) components significantly varied under different land uses (P < 0.05). Overall, the fluorescent WSOM quantities and its components (Comp.1, Comp.2 and Comp.4) were present at markedly lower concentrations for agricultural land use relative to the other three land uses. The same distribution pattern was observed for carbonyl compounds and fatty acids in the riparian WSOM molecules (P < 0.05), but the distribution patterns of the lipids were different between the four land uses (P < 0.05). Industrial land could result in the input of more organic matter into the riparian wetland. Our results showed that fluvial Comp.1 and Comp.2 were significantly correlated with WSOM Comp.2 and WSOM Comp.4 (P < 0.05). We also observed that the fluvial trophic status was significantly higher when the fluvial DOM components increased (P < 0.05). These results indicated that land uses can alter the composition of riparian WSOM, reshape fluvial DOM compositions and significantly affect fluvial water quality.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				DEC	2016	16	8			SI		2399	2408		10.1007/s10113-016-0971-x						WOS:000388959100020		
J	Engel, M; Chefetz, B				Engel, Maya; Chefetz, Benny			Removal of triazine-based pollutants from water by carbon nanotubes: Impact of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and solution chemistry	WATER RESEARCH												Adsorption of organic pollutants by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the environment or removal of pollutants during water purification require deep understanding of the impacts of the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM is an integral part of environmental systems and plays a key role affecting the behavior of organic pollutants. In this study, the effects of solution chemistry (pH and ionic strength) and the presence of DOM on the removal of atrazine and lamotrigine by single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) was investigated. The solubility of atrazine slightly decreased (-5%) in the presence of DOM, whereas that of lamotrigine was significantly enhanced (by up to-70%). Simultaneous introduction of DOM and pollutant resulted in suppression of removal of both atrazine and lamotrigine, which was attributed to DOM-pollutant competition or blockage of adsorption sites by DOM. However the decrease in removal of lamotrigine was also a result of its complexation with DOM. Pre-introduction of DOM significantly reduced pollutant adsorption by the SWCNTs, whereas introduction of DOM after the pollutant resulted in the release of adsorbed atrazine and lamotrigine from the SWCNTs. These data imply that DOM exhibits higher affinity for the adsorption sites than the triazine-based pollutants. In the absence of DOM atrazine was a more effective competitor than lamotrigine for adsorption sites in SWCNTs. However, competition between pollutants in the presence of DOM revealed lamotrigine as the better competitor. Our findings help unravel the complex DOM organic pollutant CNT system and will aid in CNT-implementation in water-purification technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The high photodegradation rate is primarily ascribed to their photosensitizing properties. Though widely studied, the photo-reaction pathways are not completely revealed; photo-products mediated by different reactive oxygen species are not identified. In our study, photo degradation of fluoroquinolone norfloxacin was investigated. A rapid degradation in buffered water was observed with a first-order rate constant of 2.45/hr and a quantum yield of 0.039. After light screening correction, selected DOMs (5 mg CM slightly enhanced the photodegradation rate with the exception of Suwannee river hydrophobic organic matter (SR-HPO). Three major photo-products were identified using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). With O-1(2) dark formation and competitor experiments, norfloxacin self-sensitized O-1(2) was found to oxidize norfloxacin by inducing its piperazine chain cleavage. DOMs exhibited a dual role by inhibiting the O-1(2)-mediated reaction while enhancing the heterolytic defluorination pathway. DOMs were proposed to enhance heterolytic defluorination by donating electron to triplet state FLQ this proposal was supported with specific UV absorbance (SUVA) as an indicator for the abundance of pi bonds. Fluoride formation indicated a 79% elimination ratio of fluorine, an important functional group for antimicrobial activity. This work provides important new insights into the photochemical fate of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in natural water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study demonstrates comprehensive characterization of DOM by an initial polarity-based stepwise solid phase extraction (SPE) with single methanol elution of the cartridges, but separate collection of equal aliquots of eluate. The reduction of molecular complexity in the individual DOM fractions attenuates intermolecular interactions and substantially increases the disposable resolution of any structure selective characterization. Suwannee River DOM (SR DOM) was used to collect five distinct SPE fractions with overall 91% DOC recovery. Optical spectroscopy (UV and fluorescence spectroscopy), high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed analogous hierarchical clustering among the five eluates corroborating the robustness of this approach. Two abundant moderately hydrophobic fractions contained most of the SR DOM compounds, with substantial proportions of aliphatics, carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules, carbohydrates and aromatics. A minor early eluting hydrophilic fraction was highly aliphatic and presented a large diversity of alicyclic carboxylic acids, whereas the two late eluting, minor hydrophobic fractions appeared as a largely defunctionalized mixture of aliphatic molecules. Comparative mass analysis showed that fractionation of SR DOM was governed by multiple molecular interactions depending on O/C ratio, molecular weight and aromaticity. The traditional optical indices SUVA(254) and fluorescence index (FI) indicated the relative aromaticity in agreement with FTICR mass and NMR spectra; the classical fluorescent peaks A and C were observed in all four latter eluates. This versatile approach can be easily expanded to preparative scale under field conditions, and transferred to different DOM sources and SPE conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, UV-vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy were combined to characterize the components and structure of DOM in surface sediments of Dongting Lake. The relationship of the structural characteristics of DOM with N, P contents and water quality was also explored. The results showed that the DOC contents of Dongting Lake sediments were between 60.004 and 368.286 mg kg(-1), with the general trend of Eastern > Southern >Western for the Dongting Lake regions. The DOM in the sediments mainly comprised humic-like substances, which were greater in the Eastern than in the Southern and Western Dongting Lake regions by 4.1% and 6.43%, respectively. The humification degree of DOM in the sediments was high, and the substitution groups in the aromatic rings mainly contained carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and esters. The source of DOM in the Dongting Lake sediments was significantly influenced by terrestrial input and biological metabolism. Furthermore, the composition and structural characteristics of DOM in the Dongting Lake sediments were found to be closely related to the contents of N and P in the sediments, as well as the water quality. Especially, the ratio of humic-like substances to protein-like substances (P ((III+V,n))/P-(I+II,P-n)) can be indirectly taken as an indicator of water quality. Thus, the changes of composition and structure of sediment DOM can establish a relationship with the water quality, and will have an indicative effect on lake trophic status. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Mediterranean littoral is particularly exposed to both anthropogenic and Saharan aerosol depositions on a more or less regular basis. During the last few decades experimental studies have been devoted to examining the effect of inorganic nutrient inputs from dust on microbial activity. In this study, we performed experiments at two different locations of the NW Mediterranean, where we evaluated the changes in the quality and quantity of dissolved organic matter due to atmospheric inputs of different origin (Saharan and anthropogenic) and its subsequent transformations mediated by microbial activities. In both experiments the humic-like and protein-like substances, and the fluorescence quantum yield increased after addition. In general, these changes in the quality of dissolved organic matter did not significantly affect the prokaryotes. The recalcitrant character of the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) associated with aerosols was confirmed, as we found negligible utilization of chromophoric compounds over the experimental period. We framed these experiments within a two-year time series data set of atmospheric deposition and coastal surface water analyses. These observations showed that both Saharan and anthropogenic inputs induced changes in the quality of organic matter, increasing the proportion of FDOM substances. This increase was larger during Saharan dust events than in the absence of Saharan influence.																	0214-8358	1886-8134				DEC	2016	80	4					437	446		10.3989/scimar.04318.20B						WOS:000388738200001

Concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nutrients were significantly higher in pore waters than in the overlying waters. Pore water DOC, DON, and DOP concentrations in the upper most sediment layer (0-1 cm) ranged from 246 to 888 mu M, from 14.6 to 75.9 mu M, and from 0.02 to 9.83 mu M, respectively. Concentrations of DOM and nutrients in pore waters occasionally showed clear seasonal trends and were highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. The seasonal trends in the pore water DOM concentrations were coupled with trends in the overlying water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. Benthic effluxes of DON and DOP were low compared with those of inorganic nutrients, accounting for only 1.0 and 1.5 % of the total benthic effluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively; thus benthic DOM fluxes were quantitatively insignificant to the inorganic nutrient fluxes in Tokyo Bay. The DOM fluxes represented about 7, 3, and 10 % of the riverine discharge of DOC, DON, and DOP to Tokyo Bay, respectively.																	0916-8370	1573-868X				DEC	2016	72	6					851	866		10.1007/s10872-016-0382-0						WOS:000388211800003

High amounts of free aromatic amino acids in the protein-like fluorescence of water-dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS												Fluorescence spectroscopy is widely used to study water pollution. The fluorescence of water natural organic matter can be classified into two groups: the protein-like fluorescence originating from aromatic amino acids and the humic fluorescence originating from humic substances. Actually, the precise molecular origin of the protein-like fluorescence is unknown because this fluorescence may be caused by either free amino acids, peptides or proteins. Therefore, we studied the molecular origin of the protein-like fluorescence of Suwannee River natural organic matter and fractions A, B and C + D obtained by size exclusion chromatography/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The electrophoretic mobilities of fractions varied in the order C + D > B > A and the molecular size in the opposite order. Our results show that the protein-like fluorescence is almost exclusively located in high molecular size fraction A and medium molecular size fraction B. Retention times and fluorescence emission spectra of authentic free aromatic amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan were identical with the retention times and emission spectra of several chromatographic peaks of fractions A and B. More than 50 % of the protein-like fluorescence is due to free aromatic amino acids incorporated in water natural organic matter.																	1610-3653	1610-3661				DEC	2016	14	4					495	500		10.1007/s10311-016-0556-4						WOS:000388105000008		
J	Quang, VL; Kim, HC; Maqbool, T; Hur, J				Viet Ly Quang; Kim, Hyun-Chul; Maqbool, Tahir; Hur, Jin			Fate and fouling characteristics of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in ultrafiltration of terrestrial humic substances	CHEMOSPHERE												Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling caused by terrestrial input of dissolved organic matter (DOM), especially during high flood periods, is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the fouling characteristics of three different terrestrial humic substances (HS) on regenerated cellulose (RC) UF membranes with the pore sizes of 30 k-3 kDa via conventional bulk HS measurements as well as an advanced fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) identified one protein-like (C1) and three humic-like fluorescent components (C2-C4) from soil and leaf-derived HS. The fate of the different fluorescent components was individually tracked for the UF processes. The higher removal rates were found generally on the order of high molecular weight (HMW) Cl to smaller sized humic-like components (C4 > C3 > C2) regardless of the HS sources, implying the importance of HS molecular sizes on the UF operation. Among the humic-like components, C2 was the most associated with irreversible fouling, while other two humic-like components contributed more to reversible fouling. For soil-derived HS, C4 can be suggested as a good surrogate for membrane fouling, as evidenced by the highest correlation between the removal rates and the total fouling indices among the tested HS variables including conventional bulk parameters. Our study demonstrated a promising application of EEM-PARAFAC for probing membrane fouling of terrestrial DOM, which provided additional insight into the fate of different fluorescent components on the UF processes.

Enhanced availability of mercury bound to dissolved organic matter for methylation in marine sediments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The forms of inorganic mercury (Hg-II) taken up and methylated by bacteria in sediments still remain largely unknown. From pure cultures studies, it has been suggested that dissolved organic matter (DOM) may facilitate the uptake either by acting as a shuttle molecule, transporting the Hg-II atom to divalent metal transporters, or by binding Hg-II and then being transported into the cell as a carbon source. Enhanced availability of Hg complexed to DOM has however not yet been demonstrated in natural systems. Here, we show that Hg-II complexed with DOM of marine origin was up to 2.7 times more available for methylation in sediments than Hg-II added as a dissolved inorganic complex (Hg-II (aq)). We argue that the DOM used to complex Hg-II directly facilitated the bacterial uptake of Hg-II whereas the inorganic dissolved Hg-II complex adsorbed to the sediment matrix before forming bioavailable dissolved Hg-II complexes. We further demonstrate that differences in net methylation in sediments with high and low organic carbon content may be explained by differences in the availability of carbon to stimulate the activity of Hg methylating bacteria rather than, as previously proposed, be due to differences in Hg-II binding capacities between sediments.

Re-parameterization of a quasi-analytical algorithm for colored dissolved organic matter dominant inland waters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Quasi-Analytical Algorithms (QAAs) are based on radiative transfer equations and have been used to derive inherent optical properties (IOPs) from the above surface remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) in aquatic systems in which phytoplankton is the dominant optically active constituents (OACs). However, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Non Algal Particles (NAP) can also be dominant OACs in water bodies and till now a QAA has not been parametrized for these aquatic systems. In this study, we compared the performance of three widely used QAAs in two CDOM dominated aquatic systems which were unsuccessful in retrieving the spectral shape of IOPS and produced minimum errors of 350% for the total absorption coefficient (a), 39% for colored dissolved matter absorption coefficient (a(CDM)) and 7566.33% for phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(phy)). We re-parameterized a QAA for CDOM dominated (hereafter QAA(CDOM)) waters which was able to not only achieve the spectral shape of the OACs absorption coefficients but also brought the error magnitude to a reasonable level. The average errors found for the 400-750nm range were 30.71 and 14.51 for a, 14.89 and 8.95 for a(CDM) and 25.90 and 29.76 for a(phy) in Funil and Itumbiara Reservoirs, Brazil respectively. Although QAA(CDOM) showed significant promise for retrieving IOPs in CDOM dominated waters, results indicated further tuning is needed in the estimation of a(lambda) and a(phy)(lambda). Successful retrieval of the absorption coefficients by QAA(CDOM) would be very useful in monitoring the spatio-temporal variability of IOPS in CDOM dominated waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Couturier, M; Nozais, C; Chaillou, G				Couturier, Mathilde; Nozais, Christian; Chaillou, Gwenaelle			Microtidal subterranean estuaries as a source of fresh terrestrial dissolved organic matter to the coastal ocean	MARINE CHEMISTRY												This paper reports on the distribution of DOM along the subterranean estuary (STE) of a microtidal beach located in the Gulf of St-Lawrence (Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec, Canada). We combined porewater DOC concentrations as well as CDOM absorbance- and fluorescence-derived indices (S-R, SUVA(254), FI and BIX) to explore the ground-water -borne DOM transformations along the groundwater flow path to the outflow face of the beach. Based on these optical indices and multivariate analysis, results reveal a highly complex environment where biogeochemical processes and water-rock interaction alter molecular composition of DOM. Marine and groundwater end members exhibited significantly different optical derived indices. Along the STE, however, DOC and CDOM showed non-conservative behaviour with the production of both "new" high molecular weight (MW) and lignin -derived compounds as well as microbially-derived CDOM. There is no significant relationship between DOC and CDOM optical properties because of the complex and dynamic system. A redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed a relationship between redox conditions and DOM pool signature. The RDA results highlighted a negative correlation between DOC and dissolved Fe, particularly in the suboxic zone of the STE where Fe-oxides are reduced. The RDA showed that the increase of SR and SUVA254, (i.e., from high MW CDOM compounds with low aromaticity to low MW CDOM compounds with high aromaticity) is inversely correlated to dissolved metals, particularly total dissolved Mn. Whatever the processes involved in the carbon behaviour, our results showed the dominance of terrestrial DOM pool all along the STE. Despite the fact that marine-derived particulate solutes are considered as the primary source of DOC in tidal sands, our study illustrated how groundwater-borne solutes may affect reaction in STE and opens questions about the terrestrial DOM export to a coastal bay.

J	Ylostalo, P; Seppala, J; Kaitala, S; Maunula, P; Simis, S				Ylostalo, Pasi; Seppala, Jukka; Kaitala, Seppo; Maunula, Petri; Simis, Stefan			Loadings of dissolved organic matter and nutrients from the Neva River into the Gulf of Finland - Biogeochemical composition and spatial distribution within the salinity gradient	MARINE CHEMISTRY												We studied the loadings of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nutrients from the Neva River into the Eastern Gulf of Finland, as well as their distribution within the salinity gradient. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 390 to 840 mu M, and were related to absorption of colored DOM (CDOM) at 350 nm, a(CDOM)(350), ranging from 2.70 to 17.8 m(-1). With increasing salinity both DOC and a(CDOM) decreased, whereas the slope of a(CDOM) spectra, S-CDOM(300-700), ranging from 14.3 to 21.2 mu m(-1), increased with salinity. Deviations of these properties from conservative mixing models were occasionally observed within the salinity range of approximately 1-4, corresponding to the region between 27 and 29 degrees E. These patterns are suggested to mostly reflect seasonal changes in properties of river end-member and hydrodynamics of the estuary, rather than non-conservative processes. On the other hand, observed nonlinear relationships observed between a(CDOM)*(350) and S-CDOM(275-295) emphasized the importance of photochemistry among various transformation processes of DOM. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen was effectively transformed in the estuary into particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), of which DON was mostly exported from the estuary, enhancing productivity in nitrogen limited parts of the Gulf of Finland. DON concentrations ranged from 12.4 to 23.5 mu M and its estuarine dynamics were clearly uncoupled from DOC. In contrast to DOC, estuarine DON dynamics suggest that its production exceeds losses in the estuary. Total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) loadings from the Neva River and St. Petersburg were estimated as 73.5 Gg N yr(-1) and 4.2 Gg P yr(-1), respectively. Approximately 59% of TN and 53% of TP loads were in organic forms. DOC and DON loadings were estimated as 741.4 Gg C yr(-1) and 19.0 Gg N yr(-1), respectively. Our estimate for DOC loading was evaluated against a previously published carbon budget of the Baltic Sea. According to the updated model, the Baltic Sea could be identified as a weak source of carbon into the atmosphere. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Optical characterization of dissolved organic matter in the Amazon River plume and the Adjacent Ocean: Examining the relative role of mixing, photochemistry, and microbial alterations	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The Amazon River is a major source of terrestrially-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the Atlantic Ocean. Measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) were made in the water within and adjacent to the Amazon River plume during two cruises conducted at periods of low (September-October/2011) and high (July/2012) river discharges. Four fluorescent components were resolved by excitation emission matrix fluoresces combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) as two terrestrial humic-like components, one marine humic-like component, and one autochthonous protein-like component. The distribution and dynamics of optically active fraction of DOM were largely controlled by physical mixing along the Amazon River-ocean continuum, with the exception of the protein-like cornponent whose distribution was driven by factors other than dilution. Principal component analysis (PCA) enabled differentiation of water samples following gradient of terrestrial signatures and distinction of source materials associated with different fluorescent components. On board water incubation experiments with photochemical and microbial alterations revealed that photochemistry was primarily responsible for the removal of optically active fraction of DOM whereas the contribution of microbial transformation to this fraction was minor. Results from this work will provide a better understanding of DOM compositions and transformations in a globally significant river plume-ocean continuum. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lee, BS; Lajtha, K				Lee, Baek Soo; Lajtha, Kate			Hydrologic and forest management controls on dissolved organic matter characteristics in headwater streams of old-growth forests in the Oregon Cascades	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component of the carbon cycle linking terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although many factors have been identified as influencing DOM fluxes and biochemical quality in rivers with varying land cover types, controls on DOM composition in forested headwater catchments of the western U.S. are poorly understood. This study examined the effect of hydrologic patterns and forest management history on stream DOM chemistry at watersheds located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest of the Oregon Cascades. Specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), generally indicative of aromaticity, increased in streams during storms with increasing surficial soil horizon and litter DOM inputs. Fluorescence excitation and emission matrices (EEMs) with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) identified a protein-like DOM fluorescent component as well as several other components associated with terrestrial plant material. Correlation analysis between the protein-like DOM component and hydrologic patterns, SUVA(254), and DOC concentrations suggest that DOM during dry seasons represents more microbially-processed sources, such as protein-rich, deeper soil or DOM with greater in-stream microbial processing, compared to more plant-like surface soil sources observed during high flow. The base flow index (the proportion of base flow to total flow) showed a high correlation with the relative proportion of protein-like DOM indicating that deep soil water is a source of the protein-like signal. The relative proportions of the protein-like DOM and humic DOM were also influenced by the abundance of coarse woody debris (CWD), but not live tree biomass, with the proportions of protein like DOM highest in harvested watersheds with low surficial CWD. This study shows UV and fluorescent spectroscopy is a viable finger printing method to elucidate DOM sources in pristine headwater streams at the western Cascades of Oregon.

J	Phong, DD; Hur, J				Diep Dinh Phong; Hur, Jin			Non-catalytic and catalytic degradation of effluent dissolved organic matter under UVA-and UVC-irradiation tracked by advanced spectroscopic tools	WATER RESEARCH												Non-catalytic and catalytic photodegradation of effluent dissolved organic matter (EfDOM) was examined under two different light sources (UVA and UVC). The degradation behavior was tracked by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance, and different fluorescent components. Catalytic UV irradiation resulted in much higher degradation rates than those without photocatalysts (TiO2 and ZnO) regardless of the tracking variables. For non-catalytic degradation, the highest removal rates of UV absorbance were found at wavelengths close to the irradiation of either UVC or UVA, while the photo catalytic degradation rates were consistently higher at longer wavelengths. The pseudo first-order rates of UV absorbance individually calculated at several representative wavelengths were very consistent with the sequential orders interpreted from two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS). Excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) identified one tryptophan-like (C1) and two humic-like (C2 and C3) components from EfDOM samples. Among those, Cl exhibited the lowest adsorption extent and the highest degradation rates for both photocatalysts, suggesting that the photocatalysis is mainly governed by hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solution. All observed degradation behaviors were well explained by the irradiation wavelengths, the extent of adsorption onto catalysts, and the presumed structure of the tracked component. Our study demonstrated that EEM-PARAFAC and 2D-COS could provide further insights into both non-catalytic and catalytic degradation of EfDOM upon UV irradiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was carried out in a small area of the Schwingbach catchment, an anthropogenic-influenced landscape in central Germany. We investigated 30 different soil water samples from 4 sites and different depths (managed meadow (0-5 cm, 40-50 cm), deciduous forest (0-5 cm), mixed-coniferous forest (0-5 cm) and agricultural land (0-5 cm, 40-50 cm)) and 8 stream samples. 6194 molecular formulae and their magnitude-weighted parameters ((O/C)(w), (H/C)(w), (N/C)(w), (AI-mod)(w), (DBE/C)(w), (DBE/O)(w), (DBE-O)(w), (C#)(w), (MW)(w)) were used to describe the molecular composition of the samples. The samples can be roughly divided in three groups. Group 1 contains samples from managed meadow 40-50 cm and stream water, which are characterized by high saturation compared to samples from group 2 including agricultural samples and samples from the surface meadow (0-5 cm), which held more nitrogen containing and aromatic compounds. Samples from both forested sites (group 3) are characterized by higher molecular weight and O/C ratio. Environmental parameters vary between sites and among these parameters pH and nitrate significantly affect chemical composition of DOM. Results indicate that most DOM in streams is of terrestrial origin. However, 120 molecular formulae were detected only in streams and not in any of the soil samples. These compounds share molecular formulae with peptides, unsaturated aliphatics and saturated FA-CHO/FA-CHOX. Compounds only found in soil samples are much more aromatic, have more double bonds and a much lower H/C ratio but higher oxygen content, which indicates the availability of fresh plant material and less microbial processed material compared to stream samples.

J	Guarch-Ribot, A; Butturini, A				Guarch-Ribot, Alba; Butturini, Andrea			Hydrological conditions regulate dissolved organic matter quality in an intermittent headwater stream. From drought to storm analysis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Storms and droughts are an essential driver for the dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration in headwater streams. However, the relationship between DOM quality and discharge (Q) has not been addressed in depth and the impact of other hydro-climatic or biogeochetnical drivers has not been explored. In this study DOM quality variability was explored at seasonal and storm event scales during an intensive 2.5-year-long sampling in a Mediterranean stream characterized by a severe summer drought. DOM quality was described in terms of absorbance and fluorescence properties. Most of the DOM properties were strongly related to discharge revealing the input of allochthonous, degraded, aromatic, humic and increased-molecular-size DOM under high flow conditions. However, these relationships disappeared or reversed during drying and rewetting periods. Each DOM response at the storm event scale (DOM-Qhysteresis) was outlined with two descriptors that summarised its trend (dilution/flushing/chemostasis) and shape (linear/nonlinear response). Multiple linear regression and commonality analysis showed that, in addition to the magnitude of storm episodes, antecedent hydrological conditions, namely pre-event basal flow and the magnitude of the previous storm event, played a significant role in regulating the trends and shapes of DOM-Q hysteresis.

DOM was mainly recovered in the hydrophobic acidic and hydrophobic neutral sub-fractions (45 and 35%, respectively) while most metals were found in the acidic sub-fractions (46-93%) except for V, Fe and As, which were predominant in the basic sub-fractions (74-93%) and Cd in the neutral ones (50%). DOM exhibited a broad MWD in groundwaters, usually from 5 to 200 kDa and was dominated by high molecular weight hydrophobic acids, low molecular weight hydrophilic acids and hydrophilic neutral compounds. Most of the studied metals (Fe, Cr, Co, Sn, Ba, Hg) were associated with the high molecular weight DOM fraction (ca. 40-100 kDa). Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and Ni interacted with a broad range of DOM size fractions but were still most abundant in the high molecular weight fraction. Few metal/metalloids (As, V and Cr in some cases) presented a very weak affinity for DOM and presumably existed predominantly as "free" inorganic ions in solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the deterioration of water quality has intensified at river estuary and aquaculture area. Meanwhile, these regions dominated by plants had relatively low dissolved oxygen concentrations. UV-vis spectra showed lower humification degree and simpler molecular structure in the DOM collected from the pollutant-receiving region. The analysis of PCA combined with synchronous fluorescence spectra yielded two principal components (PCs) that account for 99.44% of the variance. PC1 showed a dominant protein-like fluorophore at 279nm and PC2 was characterized by dominated fulvic-like fluorophores (325 and 331 nm). The results of PCA indicated that DOM collected from the river estuary, the aquaculture region, and the eutrophication area exhibited a higher protein-like fluorophore, and higher PC1 and lower PC2 loadings (PC1>0.7, PC2<0.4). Meanwhile, a higher fulvic-like fluorophore existed in the DOM samples collected from a clean region (PC1<0.4, PC2>0.7). HCA identified four clusters that accorded with the PCA results. This study suggested that water quality and the sources, and spectral characteristics of DOM were influenced mainly by human activities (agriculture, industrial, and domestic wastewater from upstream, food and excrement from aquaculture) and natural processes (aquatic-plant and microorganism activities).																	1863-0650	1863-0669				NOV	2016	44	11								10.1002/clen.201500887						WOS:000387806200002		
J	Oh, S; Shin, WS; Kim, HT				Oh, Sanghwa; Shin, Won Sik; Kim, Hong Tae			Effects of pH, dissolved organic matter, and salinity on ibuprofen sorption on sediment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Ibuprofen is well known as one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in rivers. However, sorption of ibuprofen onto sediment has not been considered in spite of its high K (ow) (3.5). In this study, the effects of various environmental conditions such as pH (4, 5.3, and 7), the concentrations of dissolved organic matters (0 to 1.0 mM citrate and urea), salinity (0, 10, 20, and 30 part per thousand), and presence of other PPCP (salicylic acid) on ibuprofen sorption were investigated. Linear model mainly fitted the experimental data for analysis. The distribution coefficient (K (d)) in the linear model decreased from 6.76 at pH 4 to near zero at pH 7, indicating that neutral form of ibuprofen at pH below pKa (5.2) was easily sorbed onto the sediment whereas the sorption of anionic form at pH over pKa was not favorable. To investigate the effect of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) on ibuprofen sorption, citrate and urea were used as DOMs. As citrate concentration increased, the K (d) value decreased but urea did not interrupt the ibuprofen sorption. Citrate has three carboxyl functional groups which can attach easily ibuprofen and hinder its sorption onto sediment. Salinity also affected ibuprofen sorption due to decrease of the solubility of ibuprofen as salinity increased. In competitive sorption experiment, the addition of salicylic acid also led to enhance ibuprofen sorption. Conclusively, ibuprofen can be more easily sorbed onto the acidified sediments of river downstream, especially estuaries or near-shore environment with low DOM concentration.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2016	23	22					22882	22889		10.1007/s11356-016-7503-6						WOS:000387602800057	27572692

Understanding marine dissolved organic matter production: Compositional insights from axenic cultures of Thalassiosira pseudonana	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a key source of carbon and nutrients to microbial life in the oceans, but rapid biological utilization of labile DOM confounds its compositional characterization. In order to characterize potentially bioavailable DOM produced by phytoplankton, DOM from axenic cultures of Thalassiosira pseudonana cultivated in phosphorus (P) replete and low P conditions was extracted using high-recovery electrodialysis (ED) techniques, which resulted in an average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recovery of 76%+/- 7% from all cultures. Low P concentrations resulted in greater cell-normalized production of DOC relative to P replete culture controls at the same growth phase. Despite the different nutrient conditions, DOC composition and DOM molar ratios of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) were similar in all cultures. In contrast, low P concentrations influenced DOM molar carbon to phosphorus (C:P) ratios and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) composition. Under P replete and low P conditions, DOM C:P ratios were 130 (+/- 22) and 2446 (+/- 519), respectively. P-31 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy identified P esters (> 90% of DOP) as the dominant P species in DOM produced under P replete conditions, with small or negligible contributions from phosphonates or glycerol P and polyphosphates. However, based on direct fluorometric analysis, DOP from low P cultures was greater than 8 times enriched in dissolved polyphosphate compared to DOP from replete cultures, which is consistent with the growing evidence that polyphosphate is a dynamic component of total P in low P ocean regions.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2016	61	6					2222	2233		10.1002/lno.10367						WOS:000387749500019

This paper reports the first DOC, CDOM and FDOM data for this area together with an evaluation of fluorescence as a fast and inexpensive tool for early oil spill detection in marine waters. The samples collected in the oil spill showed a fluorescence intensity markedly higher (similar to 5 fold) than all the other samples. The excitation-emission matrixes, coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), allowed for the identification in the FDOM pool of a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, humic-like and protein-like fluorophores.

J	He, XS; Fan, QD				He, Xiao-Song; Fan, Qin-Dong			Investigating the effect of landfill leachates on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter in groundwater using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra coupled with fluorescence regional integration and self-organizing map	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												For the purpose of investigating the effect of landfill leachate on the characteristics of organic matter in groundwater, groundwater samples were collected near and in a landfill site, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted from the groundwater samples and characterized by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra combined with fluorescence regional integration (FRI) and self-organizing map (SOM). The results showed that the groundwater DOM comprised humic-, fulvic-, and protein-like substances. The concentration of humic-like matter showed no obvious variation for all groundwater except the sample collected in the landfill site. Fulvic-like substance content decreased when the groundwater was polluted by landfill leachates. There were two kinds of protein-like matter in the groundwater. One kind was bound to humic-like substances, and its content did not change along with groundwater pollution. However, the other kind was present as "free" molecules or else bound in proteins, and its concentration increased significantly when the groundwater was polluted by landfill leachates. The FRI and SOM methods both can characterize the composition and evolution of DOM in the groundwater. However, the SOM analysis can identify whether protein-like moieties was bound to humic-like matter.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2016	23	21					21229	21237		10.1007/s11356-016-7308-7						WOS:000387599600010	27491518

The electrolytic reactor used a doped Ti anode and a graphite cathode. Under acidic conditions the oxidants and dissolved organic matter significantly promoted 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol's degradation, but under alkaline conditions the effect was slight. The peroxomonosulfate was found to be more effective than the peroxodisulfate, which was more effective than hydrogen peroxide. Up to 90% removal of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol was achieved when humic acid was present at 0.5 mg C.L-1. The degradation rate was reduced obviously as the concentration of humic or fulvic acid increased. The concentration of HO center dot was significantly higher in acidic conditions, which is in line with the degradation performance. HO center dot rather than SO4 center dot- was shown to make the main contribution to the electrochemical degradation. Under acidic conditions, this electrochemical technique has good potential technique for the removal of steroid estrogens from water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in DOM could drastically affect carbon fluxes, and the toxicity and distribution of pollutants. This study reports DOM characterization and comparison by ultra-high resolution and accuracy Fourier transformed ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) of samples from an estuarine, a marine, a riverine and a lacustrine system of southeastern Brazil (SE Brazil). The MS screening of DOM showed ions corresponding to several classes of constituents such as synthetic surfactants, lignins, lipids and sulfur polyoxygenated (CHOS) constituents. The CHOS constituents and the synthetic surfactants displayed higher abundance for riverine and lacustrine samples which have higher human impact than the marine and estuarine samples. We hypothesized that these CHOS compounds are formed in situ by the addition of inorganic sulfur anions such as sulfide or bisulfide to lignin derived compounds via Kraft reactions.

Selenium-rich dissolved organic matter determines selenium uptake in wheat grown on Low-selenium arable land soils	PLANT AND SOIL												The study aimed to find soil parameters that are best related to Se plant uptake for low Se soils with predominantly organic Se, and to explore the mechanisms that control Se bioavailability in the soils under study. A pot experiment using nineteen soil samples taken from different fields of arable land (potato fields) in the Netherlands was conducted on summer wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Selenium in wheat shoots and soil parameters, including basic soil properties, C:N ratio, inorganic selenite content, and Se and organic C in different soil extractions (0.01 M CaCl2, 0.43 M HNO3, hot water, ammonium oxalate, aqua regia) were analysed. Regression analysis was performed to identify soil parameters that determine Se content in wheat shoots. The regression model shows that Se:DOC ratio in 0.01 M CaCl2 soil extraction explained about 88 % of the variability of Se uptake in wheat shoots. Selenium uptake increased with Se:DOC ratio in CaCl2 extraction, which can be interpreted as a measure of the content of soluble Se-rich organic molecules. Selenium:DOC ratio in CaCl2 extraction and Se uptake increased towards higher soil pH and lower soil C:N ratio. The soil C:N ratio is also negatively correlated to Se:organic C ratio in other extractions (0.43 M HNO3, hot water, ammonium oxalate, aqua regia), indicating that at low soil C:N ratio soil organic matter is richer in Se. Contrarily, the soil pH is positively and strongly correlated to Se:organic C ratio in CaCl2 and hot water extractions, but only weakly correlated to Se:organic C ratio in other extractions. Selenium-rich dissolved organic matter is the source of bioavailable Se in low Se soils with predominantly organic Se. The soil pH and quality of soil organic matter (i.e. soil C:N ratio) are the main soil properties determining Se bioavailability in these soil types.																	0032-079X	1573-5036				NOV	2016	408	1-2					73	94		10.1007/s11104-016-2900-7						WOS:000386787000006

However, activated sludge is inevitably exposed to NaClO during this cleaning process. In spite of the broad applications of on-line chemical cleaning in MBR such as chemical cleaning-in place (CIP) and chemical enhanced backwash (CEB), little information is currently available for the release of emerging dissolved organic matter (DOM) and byproducts from this prevalent practice. Therefore, in this study, activated sludge suspended in a phosphate buffered saline solution was exposed to different doses of NaClO in order to determine the generation of potential DOM and byproducts. The results showed the occurrence of significant DOM release (up to 24.7 mg/L as dissolved organic carbon) after exposure to NaClO for 30 min. The dominant components of the released DOM were characterized to be humic acid-like as well as protein-like substances by using an excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectrophotometer. Furthermore, after the contact of activated sludge with NaClO, 19 kinds of chlorinated and brominated byproducts were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, eight of which were confirmed and characterized with standard compounds. Many byproducts were found to be halogenated aromatic compounds, including halopyrroles and halo(hydro)benzoquinones, which had been reported to be significantly more toxic than the halogenated aliphatic ones. Consequently, this study offers new insights into the practice of on-line chemical cleaning, and opens up a window to re-examine the current operation of MBR by looking into the generation of micropollutants.

A study of drainage water could lead to a better understanding of the distribution and fate of terrestrial DOM in the freshwater systems. We have applied the voltammetric techniques which were developed by our group for the characterization of organic matter in the natural waters in general. Studied samples were collected in the experimental amelioration fields in the Sava river valley (45(A degrees) 33' 52aEuro(3) N/16A degrees 31' 33aEuro(3) E, 100 m above sea level), in the hydroameliorated agricultural areas in Croatia. The rough characterization of the type, nature and reactivity of DOM was done through the study of surface activity (SA) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), copper complexing capacity (CuCC) and apperent stability constants, and measurements of organic and inorganic reduced sulfur species (RSS) fractions. The results confirm that the electrochemical approach gives a valuable and comprehensive insight into physicochemical characteristics of DOM in the drainage water and could be successfully applied to temporal studies in different terrestrial ecosystem.																	1432-8488	1433-0768				NOV	2016	20	11			SI		3097	3105		10.1007/s10008-016-3245-0						WOS:000386343800018

The influence of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and light illumination on the reduction efficiency of anthraquinone-2-disulfonate (AQS) was investigated using 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as the target species. The optimum reduction conditions were found to be in the dark under anaerobic conditions at pH 8.0 and 30 degrees C. Quinone-reducing bacteria can use the quinone structure of DOM components as a terminal electron acceptor coupling with microbial growth to promote biodegradation. Compared with other DOM models, AQS best stimulated E2 biodegradation and the mediating effect was improved as the AQS concentration increased from 0 to 0.5 mM. However, further increase had an inhibiting effect. Natural DOM containing lake humic acid (LHA) and lake fulvic acid (LFA) had a very important accelerating effect on the degradation of E2, the action mechanism of which was consistent with that defined using DOM models. The natural DOM contained more aromatic compounds, demonstrating their greater electron-accepting capacity and generally more effective support for microorganism growth and E2 oxidation than Aldrich humic acid (HA). These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of microbial degradation of steroid estrogens in anaerobic environments and confirm DOM as an important terminal electron acceptor in pollutant transformation.

Using network analysis to discern compositional patterns in ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry data of dissolved organic matter	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY												RATIONALE: Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) has long been recognized as a large and dynamic component of the global carbon cycle. Yet, DOM is chemically varied and complex and these attributes present challenges to researchers interested in addressing questions about the role of DOM in global biogeochemical cycles. METHODS: Organic matter extracts from seawater were analyzed by direct infusion with electrospray ionization into a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Network analysis was used to quantify the number of chemical transformations between mass-to-charge values in each sample. The network of chemical transformations was calculated using the MetaNetter plug-in within Cytoscape. The chemical transformations serve as markers for the shared structural characteristics of compounds within complex DOM. RESULTS: Network analysis revealed that transformations involving selected sulfur-containing moieties and isomers of amino acids were more prevalent in the deep sea than in the surface ocean. Common chemical transformations were not significantly different between the deep sea and surface ocean. Network analysis complements existing computational tools used to analyze ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry data. CONCLUSIONS: This combination of ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry with novel computational tools has identified new potential building blocks of organic compounds in the deep sea, including the unexpected importance of dissolved organic sulfur components. The method described here can be readily applied by researchers to analyze heterogeneous and complex DOM.

M.; Bradley, Chris; Hannah, David; Krause, Stefan			Real-time monitoring of nutrients and dissolved organic matter in rivers: Capturing event dynamics, technological opportunities and future directions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Excessive riverine nutrient concentrations threaten aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning and can pose substantial risks to human health. Robust monitoring strategies are therefore required to generate reliable estimates of river nutrient loads and to improve understanding of the catchment processes that drive nutrient fluxes. Furthermore, these data are vital for prediction of future trends under changing environmental conditions and thus the development of appropriate mitigation measures. In recent years, technological developments have led loan increase in the use of in-situ nutrient analysers, which enable measurements at far higher temporal resolutions than can be achieved with discrete sampling and subsequent laboratory analysis. In this paper, we review the principles underlying the key techniques used for in-situ nutrient monitoring and highlight both the advantages, opportunities and challenges associated with high-resolution sampling programs. We then suggest how adaptive monitoring strategies, comprising several different temporal sample frequencies, controlled by one or more 'trigger variables' (e.g. river stage, turbidity, or nutrient concentration), can advance our understanding of catchment nutrient dynamics while simultaneously overcoming many of the practical and economic challenges encountered in typical in-situ river nutrient monitoring applications. We present examples of short-term variability in river nutrient dynamics, driven by complex catchment behaviour, which support our case for the development of monitoring systems that can adapt in real-time to rapid changes in environmental conditions. Finally, we suggest future research directions based on emerging technologies in this field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessing the drivers of dissolved organic matter export from two contrasting lowland catchments, U.K	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Two lowland lowland catchments in the U.K. were sampled throughout 2010-11 to investigate the dominant controls on dissolved organic matter quantity and composition. The catchments had marked differences in terms of nutrient status, land cover and contrasting lithologies resulting in differences in the dominant flow pathways (groundwater vs. surface water dominated). The Upper Wylye is a chalk stream with a baseflow index of 0.98, draining a catchment dominated by intensive agricultural production. Millersford Brook is a lowland peat catchment with a baseflow index of 0.43, chaining a semi-natural catchment. with heather moorland and coniferous forest Samples were collected weekly between October 2010 and September 2011 from eleven sampling locations. Samples were analysed to determine dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus fractions with DOM composition evaluated via the DOC:DON ratio, DOC:DOP ratio, specific UV absorption a1254 nm, absorbance ratio (a(250):a(365)) and the spectral slope parameter between 350 and 400 nm (S350-400). Significant differences were observed in all determinands between the catchments, over time, and spatially along nutrient enrichment and geoclimaLic gradients. Seasonal variation in preferential flow pathways mobil ising groundwater-derived DOM were identified as likely controls on the delivery of DOM in the permeable chalk dominated catchment. Steeper S350-400 values and elevated 0250:03 5 ratios in this catchment suggest material of a lower bulk aromatic C content and molecular weight delivered during the winter months when compared to the summer. DOC:DON ratios were markedly lower in the chalk catchment than the peatland catchment, reflecting the paucity of organic matter within the mineral soils of the chalk landscape, and higher fertiliser application rates. This manuscript highlights that DOM composition varies according to catchment landscape character and hydrological function. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present study was performed to select a probe molecule that is suitable to measure these antagonistic properties of DOM. Out of nine studied nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds, 4-cyanoaniline, N,N-dimethyl-4-cyanoaniline (DMABN), sotalol (a beta-blocker) and sulfadiazine (a sulfonamide antibiotic) exhibited a marked photosensitized transformation that could be substantially inhibited by addition of phenol as a model antioxidant. The photosensitized transformation of DMABN, the selected probe compound, was characterized in detail under UV-A and visible irradiation (lambda > 320 nm) to avoid direct phototransformation. Low reactivity of DMABN with singlet oxygen was found (second-order rate constant <2 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1)). Typically at least 85% of the reactivity of DMABN could be inhibited by DOM or the model antioxidant phenol. The photosensitized transformation of DMABN mainly proceeded (>72%) through demethylation yielding N-methyl-4-cyanoaniline and formaldehyde as primary products. In solutions of standard DOM extracts and their mixtures the phototransformation rate constant of DMABN was shown to vary nonlinearly with the DOM concentration. Model equations describing the dependence of such rate constants on DOM and model antioxidant concentrations were successfully used to fit experimental data.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 18	2016	50	20					10997	11007		10.1021/acs.est.6b02868						WOS:000385907200026		
J	Zhang, Y; Blough, NV				Zhang, Yi; Blough, Neil V.			Photoproduction of One-Electron Reducing Intermediates by Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM): Relation to O-2(-) and H2O2 Photoproduction and CDOM Photooxidation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A molecular probe, 3-amino-2,2,5,5,-tetramethy-1-pyrrolydinyloxy (3ap), was employed to determine the formation rates of one-electron reducing intermediates generated photochemically from both untreated and borohydride-reduced Suwanee River fulvic and humic acids (SRFA and SRHA, respectively). This stable nitroxyl radical reacts rapidly with reducing radicals and other one-electron reductants to produce a relatively stable product, the hydroxylamine, which can be derivatized with fluorescamine, separated by HPLC and quantified fluorimetrically. We provide evidence that O-2 and 3ap compete for the same pool(s) of photoproduced reducing intermediates, and that under appropriate experimental conditions, the initial rate of hydroxylamine formation (R-H) can provide an estimate of the initial rate of superoxide (O-2(-)) formation. However, comparison of the initial rates of H2O2 formation (R-H2O2) to that of R-H show far larger ratios of R-H/R-H2O2 (similar to 6-13) than be accounted for by simple O-2(-) dismutation (R-H/R-H2O2 = 2), implying a significant oxidative sink of O-2(-) (similar to 67-85%). Because of their high reactivity with O-2(-) and their likely importance in the photochemistry of CDOM, we suggest that coproduced phenoxy radicals could represent a viable oxidative sink. Because O-2(-)/phenoxy radical reactions can lead to more highly oxidized products, O-2(-) could be playing a far more significant role in the photooxidation of CDOM than has been previously recognized.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 18	2016	50	20					11008	11015		10.1021/acs.est.6b02919						WOS:000385907200027

This metal oxide nanoparticle (NP) plays a key role in determining lead pollution in drinking water and receiving water bodies. This study uses nPbO(2(s)) and medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) as surrogates to investigate the aqueous fate and,toxicological risk of metal oxide NPs associated with water matrices. The larvae of medaka were treated with solutions containing nPbO(2(s)) or Pb(II)(aq) in different water matrices for 7-14 days to investigate the in vivo toxic effects of NPs. Ionic strength enhanced aggregation and sedimentation of nPbO(2(s)) in water, leading to increased lead contents in fish bodies. However, the presence of dissolved organic matter in water enhanced particle stability and accelerated the lead dissolution, thus changing the bioavailability processes (bioaccessibility) of particles. Oxidative stress response and neurotoxicity in exposed fish was greater for nPbO(2(s)) solution with increased salinity than dissolved organic matter. We predict the bioavailability processes and toxicity of nPbO(2(s)) in medaka from the aqueous particle behavior under environmentally relevant exposure conditions. Our investigation suggests a toxicological risk of metal oxide NP pollution in the aquatic environment.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 18	2016	50	20					11292	11301		10.1021/acs.est.6b02072						WOS:000385907200059

Collected samples consisted of main stream and tributary waters impacted to a moderate and minor extent by anthropogenic activities, respectively, and treated effluents from adjacent municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs: as representative anthropogenic point source). Nanomolar Fe(II) oxidation was measured in air-saturated waters using luminol chemiluminescence in the dark at 25 degrees C. Second-order rate constant for Fe(II) oxidation (with respect to Fe(II) and O-2 concentrations) showed spatial and temporal variation. Annual average of the rate constant was highest for MWWTP effluents, followed by reservoir and river waters, with tributary waters showing the lowest oxidation rate. Manipulation experiments indicated that, in addition to pH (7.8-8.4), DOM characteristics are important explanatory variable for the Fe(II) oxidation. For example, the addition of MWWTP-derived humic-type DOM to anthropogenically less-influenced tributary water resulted in substantial increase in the oxidation rate. Significant negative correlation observed between the specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) and Fe(II) oxidation rate constant (pH 8.0) suggests a potential effect of humic-type DOM with low SUVA(254) (high aliphatic content) on Fe(II) oxidation in natural and engineered waters.

Within the next 50 to 100 years, alpine lake catchments are expected to develop increased vegetation cover similar to that of sub-alpine lake catchments which currently exist below the tree line. Such changes in vegetation could trigger increased allochthonous DOM inputs to alpine lakes. To understand the fate of allochthonous DOM in alpine lakes impacted by climate change, the photochemical reactivity of DOM in sub-alpine Lake Tiancai (located 200 m below the tree line) was investigated by excitation emission matrix fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) and UV-Vis spectra analysis. With photo-exposure, a decrease in apparent DOM molecular weight was observed and 32% DOM was photomineralized to CO2. Interestingly, the aromaticity of DOM increased after photodegradation, as evidenced by increases in both the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) and the humification index (HIX). Five ELM-PARAFAC components were identified, including four terrestrially-derived substances (C1, C2, C3 and C4; allochthonous) and one tryptophan-like substance (C5; autochthonous), Generally, allochthonous DOM represented by C2 and C3 exhibited greater photoreactivity than autochthonous DOM represented by C5. C4 was identified as a possible photoproduct with relatively high aromaticity and photorefractive tendencies and contributed to the observed increase in SUVA(254) and HIX. UV light facilitated the photodegradation of DOM and had the greatest effect on the removal of C3. This study provides information on the transformation of EEM-PARAFAC components in a sub-alpine lake, which is important in understanding the fate of increased allochthonous DOM inputs to alpine lakes impacted by climate change.

However, limited information is available concerning the relationship between DIC and different constituents of dissolved organic matter (DOM), such as fluorescent compounds. This study investigates the dynamics of DOM and their implications for carbon and nutrient cycling in the east Taiwan Strait, using DOC, absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). The study area was dominated by the waters from the South China Sea during the sampling period in summer 2013. The dynamics of DOM were influenced strongly by microbial activities, as indicated by the close correlations (the absolute value of r: 0.75-0.97, p < 0.001) between apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and DOM parameters, including DOC, the absorption coefficient at 280 nm, the fluorescence intensity of protein-like component C3, and the humification index HIX. The contribution of DOC degradation to the net increase in DIC was approximately 15% and 21% in the north and the south of the east Taiwan Strait, respectively. The DIC was correlated negatively with protein-like fluorescence, revealing the production of DIC by the microbial degradation of labile components. The DIC was correlated positively with humic-like fluorescence and HIX, suggesting that the storage of carbon by produced refractory humic substances could not compensate for the release of DIC in the deeper waters. The correlations of nutrients with DOM parameters were similar to those of DIC, further indicating the profound impacts of the dynamics of labile DOM on nutrient cycling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Molecular evidence for abiotic sulfurization of dissolved organic matter in marine shallow hydrothermal systems	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Shallow submarine hydrothermal systems are extreme environments with strong redox gradients at the interface of hot, reduced fluids and cold, oxygenated seawater. Hydrothermal fluids are often depleted in sulfate when compared to surrounding seawater and can contain high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). It is well known that sulfur in its various oxidation states plays an important role in processing and transformation of organic matter. However, the formation and the reactivity of dissolved organic sulfur (DOS) in the water column at hydrothermal systems are so far not well understood. We investigated DOS dynamics and its relation to the physicochemical environment by studying the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in three contrasting shallow hydrothermal systems off Milos (Eastern Mediterranean), Dominica (Caribbean Sea) and Iceland (North Atlantic). We used ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to characterize the DOM on a molecular level. The molecular information was complemented with general geochemical data, quantitative dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DOS analyses as well as isotopic measurements (delta H-2, delta O-18 and (FC)-C-14). In contrast to the predominantly meteoric fluids from Dominica and Iceland, hydrothermal fluids from Milos were mainly fed by recirculating seawater. The hydrothermal fluids from Milos were enriched in H2S and DOS, as indicated by high DOS/DOC ratios and by the fact that >90% of all assigned DOM formulas that were exclusively present in the fluids contained sulfur. In all three systems, DOS from hydrothermal fluids had on average lower O/C ratios (0.26-0.34) than surrounding surface seawater DOS (0.45-0.52), suggesting shallow hydrothermal systems as a source of reduced DOS, which will likely get oxidized upon contact with oxygenated seawater. Evaluation of hypothetical sulfurization reactions suggests DOM reduction and sulfurization during seawater recirculation in Milos seafloor. The four most effective potential sulfurization reactions were those exchanging an O atom by one S atom in the formula or the equivalent + H2S reaction, correspondingly exchanging H2O, H-2 and/or O-2 by a H2S molecule. Our study reveals novel insights into DOS dynamics in marine hydrothermal environments and provides a conceptual framework for molecular-scale mechanisms in organic sulfur geochemistry.

The effect of iron on the biodegradation of natural dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Iron (Fe) may alter the biodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), by interacting with DOM, phosphorus (P), and microbes. We isolated DOM and a bacterial community from boreal lake water and examined bacterial growth on DOM in laboratory experiments. Fe was introduced either together with DOM (DOM-Fe) or into bacterial suspension, which led to the formation of insoluble Fe precipitates on bacterial surfaces (Fe coating). In the latter case, the density of planktonic bacteria was an order of magnitude lower than that in the corresponding treatment without introduced Fe. The association of Fe with DOM decreased bacterial growth, respiration, and growth efficiency compared with DOM alone at the ambient concentration of dissolved P (0.16 mu molL(-1)), indicating that DOM-associated Fe limited the bioavailability of P. Under a high concentration (21 mu molL(-1)) of P, bacterial biomass and respiration were similar or several times higher in the treatment where DOM was associated with Fe than in a corresponding treatment without Fe. Based on the next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, Caulobacter dominated bacterial communities grown on DOM-Fe. This study demonstrated that association of Fe with a bacterial surface or P reduces bacterial growth and the consumption of DOM. In contrast, DOM-Fe is bioavailable and bound Fe can even stimulate bacterial growth on DOM when P is not limiting.																	2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2016	121	10					2544	2561		10.1002/2016JG003394						WOS:000387774900003

To estimate the relationship between molecular size distribution and the DOC concentration of seawater DOM, seawater was desalinated with an electric dialyzer. The recent technological advancements of desalination make us possible to recover a high percentage of seawater DOM. Surface coastal seawater samples were collected from three locations in Japan: Tokyo Bay, Kashima Port, and Cape Inubo. Samples were evaluated by a chromatography system coupled with ultraviolet (UV) absorbance, fluorescence, and non-dispersive infrared total organic carbon detectors in series. Two peaks, 1 (1.24 x 10(5)-1.54 x 10(5) Da) and 2 (9.48 x 10(2)-1.81 x 10(3) Da), were detected in all sample chromatograms. Peak 1 showed little fluorescence and UV absorption in all samples. It has been shown that carbohydrates, one of the main components of seawater DOM, exhibit almost no fluorescence or UV absorption; thus, Peak 1 could mainly consist of carbohydrates which are usually labile DOM. Total DOC concentrations of the Tokyo Bay, Kashima Port, and Cape Inubo were 1.38, 0.92, and 0.80 mg C L-1, respectively. Peak 2 accounted for 75-80% of the total DOC and showed a substantial humic-like fluorescence and UV absorption in all samples. These results indicate that the photochemical characteristics of seawater DOM significantly differ depending on its molecular size. Thus, analysis of molecular size with our HPSEC provides a new approach for quantitative and qualitative characterization of seawater DOM.																	1541-5856					OCT	2016	14	10					637	648		10.1002/lom3.10118						WOS:000386966700002

Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and citrate iron (FeCit) were used as electron donor and electron acceptor to measure electron donating capacity, electron accepting capacity and electron shuttling capacity, respectively. Afterwards, the influenced factors of electron transfer capacity were studied by spectral analysis. The results showed that protein-like components and humic-like components were able to transfer electrons, and they also accepted electrons from microorganisms. Electron donating capacity and electron accepting capacity increased firstly and then decreased. However, electron shuttling capacity increased persistently during the landfill process. Protein-like components were the main components of dissolved organic matter during the initial landfill stage, and it was mainly responsible for the electron donoring capacity and electron accepting capacity of DOM. Electron shuttling capacity resulted from humic-like components during the cyclic redox process. Electron shuttling capacity persistently increased during the landfill process based on humic-like components generated during the stage.																	0253-3820	1872-2040				OCT	2016	44	10					1568	1573		10.1016/S1872-2040(16)60964-7						WOS:000385829900006

The complexation between CBZ and DOM was demonstrated by the increase in hydrogen bonding and the disappearance of the C=O stretch obtained from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. The results indicated that two protein-like substances (component 2 and component3) and two humic-like substances (component 1 and 4) were identified in the DOM from the Yangtze Estuary. The fluorescence quenching curves of each component with the addition of CBZ and the Ryan and Weber model calculation results both demonstrated that the different components exhibited different complexation activities with CBZ. The protein-like components had a stronger affinity with CBZ than did the humic-like substances. On the other hand, the autochthonous tyrosine-like C2 played an important role in the complexation with DOM from the river channel and coastal areas, while C3 influenced by anthropogenic activities showed an obvious effect in the nearshore area. DOMs from the river channel have the highest binding capacity for CBZ, which may ascribe to the relatively high phenol content group in the DOM.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2016	23	19					19887	19896		10.1007/s11356-016-7203-2						WOS:000384555200086	27424202

We tried to provide the basis for real-time monitoring of water quality mutation by using CDOM absorption characteristics. The average values of CDOM absorption coefficients [a (280), a (350), a (440)] were (12. 90 +/- 1. 17), (3. 11 +/- 0. 40) and (0. 65 +/- 0. 09) m(-1). a(440) had linear relationships with total nitrogen (p<0. 01), total phosphorus (p<0. 001), dissolved organic carbon (p<0. 001), chemical oxygen demand (p<0. 001), Chlorophyll a (p<0. 001), which can be used to estimate the water quality parameters. The results showed that CDOM absorption coefficient reflects the nutritional status of Lake Dongping, which is close to eutrophication level. There was an obvious decrease of CDOM absorption coefficients from river mouth of Dawen River to lake center and then to the outlets of lake. This illustrated that terrestrial input is the main source of nutrients and pollutants in Lake Dongping.																	1000-0593					OCT	2016	36	10					3232	3236		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)10-3232-05						WOS:000385475500028

Peatland vascular plant functional types affect dissolved organic matter chemistry	PLANT AND SOIL												Northern peatlands are large repositories of carbon. Peatland vascular plant community composition has been functionally associated to a set of biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling. Yet, we do not fully understand to what extent vascular plant functional types (PFTs) affect the quality of dissolved organic matter, and if there is any feedback on soil microbial activity. Using a longer-term plant removal experiment in a boreo-nemoral peatland in Southern Sweden, we relate the dominance of different vascular plant functional types (i.e. ericoids and graminoids) to the chemistry of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microbial enzymatic activities (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, FDA). Our results show that PFTs modifies the composition of DOM moieties, with a decrease of low molecular weight organic compounds after vascular plant removal. The decrease of enzymatic activity by up to 68 % in the plant removal plots suggests a reduction in DOM mineralization in the absence of vascular plants. Our results show that plant-derived low molecular organic compounds enhance peatland microbial activity, and suggest that an increase of vascular plant cover in response to climate change can potentially destabilize the OM in peatlands, leading to increased carbon losses.

The characteristics and fate of dissolved organic matter in the Johannesburg-Sulfur autotrophic denitrification (JHB-SAD) system were investigated using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with a parallel factor analysis. Three components were identified including tryptophan-like (component C-1), tyrosine-like (component C-2), and fulvic-like (component C-3) materials. The tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like materials, which were more abundant than fulvic-like materials, were the dominant components of the raw municipal wastewater in Shenyang North Wastewater Treatment Plant. In the JHB-SAD system, the tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like materials were more efficiently removed than the fulvic-like materials, and the removal efficiencies of the three components were 80.8% (tryptophan-like materials), 72.5% (tyrosine-like materials), and 33.4% (fulvic-like materials), respectively. Furthermore, the removal performance of the three components varied in the different zones of the JHB-SAD system. The tryptophan-like and fulvic-like materials were removed in the pre-anoxic, anaerobic, and aerobic zones. The tyrosine-like materials were mainly degraded in the anoxic and aerobic zones; then, they were released by the bacteria in the SAD reactor. In addition, the tryptophan-like materials had a very significant positive linear correlation with the concentrations of soluble chemical oxygen demand.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2016	57	50					23622	23632		10.1080/19443994.2015.1137496						WOS:000384675100015

Water samples were collected from Baitapuhe River along human impact gradient, i.e., the rural, town, and urban regions. DOM in Baitapuhe River was composed of protein-like, microbial humic-like, fulvic-like, and humic-like fluorescent components. The protein-like was the dominant component, which consisted of tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like components. In the rural region, the variation of the microbial humic-like was higher than that of the protein-like according to the band changing order of 335 -> 281 nm, and both components changed in the same direction. In the town region, the variation of the microbial humic-like was the highest followed by the protein-like and fulvic-like on the basis of the changing band order of 335 -> 281 -> 369 nm, and these components varied in the same trend too. In the urban region, the variation of the protein-like was the highest, followed by the microbial humic-like, fulvic-like, and humic-like based on the changing band order of 282 -> 335 -> 369 -> 470 nm, and the protein-like variation was opposite to the other components. The SFS combined with PCA and two-dimensional correlation can be used as a powerful tool in investigating fluorescent components of DOM and revealing spatial variations of these fluorescent components.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2016	188	10							579	10.1007/s10661-016-5580-0						WOS:000384330800037	27660210

Microbial recycling of dissolved organic matter confines plant nitrogen uptake to inorganic forms in a semi-arid ecosystem	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Plant uptake of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) has been proposed to explain inconsistency in the ecosystem N balance of semi-arid systems. Nevertheless, direct evidence for an ecologically important role of DON in plant nutrition in these systems remains elusive under field conditions. Here, natural abundance N-15 signatures of NO3-, NH4+, DON and whole plants from a semi-arid model forest were analyzed to provide robust estimates of plant N source partitioning and relative N cycling rates under in situ conditions. Concurrently, architectural and symbiotic root traits were determined to assess their relationship to plant N acquisition strategies. Bayesian isotope mixing models indicated an insignificant contribution of DON to ecosystem plant N nutrition. Nitrate was the dominant plant N source in this ecosystem, while the contribution of NH4+ to plant nutrition varied between herbaceous (26%) and woody plants (8%). The low C:N ratio of the dissolved organic matter pool - ranging from 12.7 to 4.9 within the soil profile indicated microbial C-limitation in this ecosystem. Dissolved organic N was significantly enriched in N-15 relative to NH4+ and NO3-, corroborating the importance of dissolved organic matter recycling as a cost-effective pathway that simultaneously supplies C and nutrients for microbial metabolism. Plants exclusively depend on inorganic N forms made available through microbial N mineralization and free-living atmospheric N-2 fixation, followed by autotrophic nitrification.

Spatiotemporal patterns in the export of dissolved organic carbon and chromophoric dissolved organic matter from a coastal, blackwater river	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We examined seasonal and spatial patterns in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Chowan River watershed, North Carolina, a blackwater river which discharges into the second largest estuary in the United States, the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System. From April 2008 to May 2010, DOC concentration did not significantly vary across seasons (range 7.69-30.39 mg L-1); however, CDOM molecular size and aromaticity increased throughout the spring, decreased during the summer and fall, and remained relatively low in the winter. Spectral slope ratios suggested microbial processing of CDOM in the spring and photodegradation of CDOM in the summer and fall. Spatially, DOC and CDOM concentrations were similar in the mainstem and at the mouths of two tributaries, Bennetts Creek and Wiccacon River, but were significantly higher upstream on the tributaries. DOC concentration was positively correlated with CDOM absorbance coefficients at 254 and 350 nm; however, these optical proxies explained only similar to 60 % of the variance. DOC and CDOM absorption loads to the Albemarle Sound ranged from 2.63 x 10(10) g year(-1) and 9.84 x 10(10) m(2) year(-1), respectively, in a dry year and 7.9 x 10(10) g year(-1) and 2.2 x 10(11) m(2) year(-1), respectively, in a wet year, which are comparable to non-blackwater rivers with larger watersheds. Blackwater rivers may therefore represent "hotspots" in coastal carbon chemistry, with seasonal variations in the quality and quantity of DOC and CDOM influencing estuarine food web dynamics and net ecosystem metabolism.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2016	78	4					823	836		10.1007/s00027-016-0474-3						WOS:000382681000016		
J	Maqbool, T; Hur, J				Maqbool, Tahir; Hur, Jin			Changes in fluorescent dissolved organic matter upon interaction with anionic surfactant as revealed by EEM-PARAFAC and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy	CHEMOSPHERE												Surfactants are present in significant amounts in both domestic and industrial wastewater, which may interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM). The present study investigated the interactions of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with three different DOM solutions, including bovine serum albumin (BSA), humic acid (HA), and the mixture of the two (BSA-HA), based on two advanced spectroscopic tools: excitation emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS). The responses of two protein-like components to the addition of SDS differed depending the presence and the absence of HA. A decreasing and an increasing trend was observed for tryptophan-like (C1) and tyrosine-like (C2) components, respectively, in the BSA solution, while the BSA-HA mixture exhibited increasing fluorescence trends for both protein-like components. The conflicting results suggest that HA plays a secondary role in the protein-SDS interactions. No interaction between the SDS and humic-like component was found. 2D-COS combined with fluorescence spectra demonstrated that the protein-SDS interaction occurred on the order of C2 > Cl for the BSA solution but C1 > C2 for the BSA-HA mixture. Analyses of Scatchard plots confirmed the sequential order interpreted from 2D-COS, showing consistent trends in the binding constants. However, the presence of HA affected the protein-SDS interactions in different manners for Cl and C2, enhancing and reducing the binding constants, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra confirmed the occurrence of conformational changes in BSA with SDS. EEM-PARAFAC and 2D-COS successfully explained different interactions of surfactant with protein-like components in the presence of HA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is fed by five rivers and connects to the Yangtze River. The area of the lake fluctuates dramatically between drawdown and flood periods with large areas of wetlands. In order to understand the CH4 production capacity and factors that influence CH4 production in the wetland, a static closed chamber combined with a gas chromatograph technique was used to investigate the influence of substrates and electron acceptors on methanogenesis. The results showed that CH4 production capacity of sediments from the Poyang Lake was and it was stimulated by trimethylamine (TMA) to a great extent. Incubation temperature played a vital role on CH4 production in sediments and the optimum temperature for methanogenesis was 35 degrees C. Minimum CH4 production capacity occurred with the addition of FeCl3, and the inhibitory effects of electron acceptors decreased in the sequence: FeCl3>MnO2>DOM>Fe2O3. In this study, DOM was demonstrated as one of the inhibitors to methanogenesis and TMA was the main substrate of methanogens in the sediments of the Poyang Lake whose pH value is 7.83.																	0959-3330	1479-487X				OCT	2016	37	20					2545	2554		10.1080/09593330.2016.1155649						WOS:000381030200001	26895174

Shift in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in the Congo River network	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The processing of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) during downstream transport in fluvial networks is poorly understood. Here, we report a dataset of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM composition (stable carbon isotope ratios, absorption and fluorescence properties) acquired along a 1700 km transect in the middle reach of the Congo River basin. Samples were collected in the mainstem and its tributaries during high-water (HW) and falling-water (FW) periods. DOC concentrations and DOM composition along the mainstem were found to differ between the two periods because of a reduced lateral mixing between the central water masses of the Congo River and DOM-rich waters from tributaries and also likely because of a greater photodegradation during FW as water residence time (WRT) increased. Although the Cuvette Centrale wetland (one of the world's largest flooded forests) continuously releases highly aromatic DOM in streams and rivers of the Congo Basin, the downstream transport of DOM was found to result in an along-stream gradient from aromatic to aliphatic compounds. The characterization of DOM through parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) suggests that this transition results from (1) the losses of aromatic compounds by photodegradation and (2) the production of aliphatic compounds by biological reworking of terrestrial DOM. Finally, this study highlights the critical importance of the river-floodplain connectivity in tropical rivers in controlling DOM biogeochemistry at a large spatial scale and suggests that the degree of DOM processing during downstream transport is a function of landscape characteristics and WRT.

Using fluorescent dissolved organic matter to trace and distinguish the origin of Arctic surface waters	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Climate change affects the Arctic with regards to permafrost thaw, sea-ice melt, alterations to the freshwater budget and increased export of terrestrial material to the Arctic Ocean. The Fram and Davis Straits represent the major gateways connecting the Arctic and Atlantic. Oceanographic surveys were performed in the Fram and Davis Straits, and on the east Greenland Shelf (EGS), in late summer 2012/2013. Meteoric (f(mw)), sea-ice melt, Atlantic and Pacific water fractions were determined and the fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (FDOM) were characterized. In Fram Strait and EGS, a robust correlation between visible wavelength fluorescence and f(mw) was apparent, suggesting it as a reliable tracer of polar waters. However, a pattern was observed which linked the organic matter characteristics to the origin of polar waters. At depth in Davis Strait, visible wavelength FDOM was correlated to apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and traced deep-water DOM turnover. In surface waters FDOM characteristics could distinguish between surface waters from eastern (Atlantic + modified polar waters) and western (Canada-basin polar waters) Arctic sectors. The findings highlight the potential of designing in situ multi-channel DOM fluorometers to trace the freshwater origins and decipher water mass mixing dynamics in the region without laborious samples analyses.

Six sets of bench-scale ozonation kinetic experiments incorporated with three different water matrices and 14 TOrCs of different reactivity (group I similar to V) were conducted. Calibrated by tryptophan and humic substances standards and verified by the lab benchtop spectroscopy, the newly developed portable/online LED sensor, which measures the UV280 absorbance, protein-like and humic-like fluorescence simultaneously, was feasible to monitor chromophores and fluorophores with good sensitivity and accuracy. The liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector combined with 2D synchronous correlation analysis further demonstrated how the DOM components of large molecular weight were transformed into small moieties as a function of the decrease of humic-like fluorescence. For TOrCs, their removal rates were well correlated with the decrease of the LED UV/fluorescence signals, and their elimination patterns were mainly determined by their reactivity with O-3 and hydroxyl radicals. At approximately 50% reduction of humic-like fluorescence almost complete oxidation of TOrCs of group I and II was reached, a similar removal percentage (25-75%) of TOrCs of group III and IV, and a poor removal percentage (<25%) of group V. This study might contribute to the smart control of advanced oxidation processes for the water and wastewater treatment in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The coupling of an ion exchange mixed bed (IEXMB) with reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration was the main hypothesis. IEXMB removed charged species, while the neutral molecules were isolated in the demineralised water and then concentrated by RO without any osmotic pressure or fouling limits. Neutrals isolation and unlimited concentration, gives this paper its originality. The nanofiltration (NF) step allows for the isolation of the LMWN. The studied reservoir water NDOM and LMWN represented respectively 35% of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) and 34% of the NDOM. Aromatic compounds were found in both fractions. The UV254 absorbance measured before and after the IEXMB evidenced the water quality signature'. IEX has never been studied as fractionation method of DOM. This IEXMB approach is thus quite novel.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				SEP-DEC	2016	30	3-4					261	270		10.1111/wej.12187						WOS:000388624500011

Knowledge of CDOM optical properties and spatial discrepancy based on the relationship between water quality and spectral parameters in the Yinma River watershed with in situ data collected from highly polluted waters are exhibited in this study. Based on the comprehensive index method, the riverine waters showed serious contamination; especially the chemical oxygen demand (COD), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were out of range of the contamination warning. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total suspended matter (TSM) with prominent non-homogenizing were significantly high in the riverine waters, but chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was the opposite. The ternary phase diagram showed that non-algal particle absorption played an important role in total non-water light absorption (>50%) in most sampling locations, and mean contributions of CDOM were 13% and 22% in the summer and autumn, respectively. The analysis of the ratio of absorption at 250-365 nm (E-250:365) and the spectral slope (S275-295) indicated that CDOM had higher aromaticity and molecular weight in autumn than in summer, which is consistent with the results of water quality and the CDOM relative contribution rate. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the environmental variables OSM (Organic suspended matter) had a strong correlation with CDOM absorption, followed by heavy metals, e.g., Mn, Hg and Cr6+. However, for the specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), the seasonal values showed opposite results compared with the reported literature. The potential reasons were that more UDOM (uncolored dissolved organic matter) from human sources (wastewater effluent) existed in the waters. Terrigenous inputs simultaneously are in relation to the a(CDOM)(440)-DOC relationship with the correlation coefficient of 0.90 in the summer (two-tailed, p < 0.01), and 0.58 in the autumn (two-tailed, p < 0.05). Spatial distribution of the CDOM parameters exhibited that the downstream regions focused on dry land have high CDOM molecular weight and aromatic hydrocarbon. Partial sampling locations around the cities or countries generally showed abnormal values due to terrigenous inputs. As a bio-optical model parameter, the spectral characteristic of CDOM is helpful in adjusting the derived algorithms in highly polluted environments. The study on organic carbon and pollutants in highly polluted waters had an important contribution to global carbon balance estimation and water environment protection.																	2073-4441					SEP	2016	8	9							399	10.3390/w8090399						WOS:000385482400039		
J	Xue, S; Chen, J; Tie, M				Xue, Shuang; Chen, Jing; Tie, Mei			Release of dissolved organic matter from melting ice	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY												The elution behavior of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from melting ice, as well as the effect of freezing and thawing temperatures on the elution behavior of DOM from melting ice, was evaluated. DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The bulk DOM and its five fractions, as well as ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing substances, trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetronitrile (HAA) precursors, and fluorescent materials in DOM exhibited a first flush behavior during ice melting, i.e., preferential elution with the early melt water fractions; the first flush behavior of DOM was stronger at higher freezing temperatures and/or at lower thawing temperatures, whereas DOM was eluted from the ice more uniformly at lower freezing temperatures and/or at higher thawing temperatures. The higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in ice was, the higher degree of enrichments of DOM within the first melt water fraction was. HAA precursors were more strongly enriched in the early melt water samples than THM precursors during ice melting. The fluorescent materials were released more uniformly over the entire melt period, as compared with the bulk DOM.

Currently, more attention was paid on contaminants behaviors of adsorption, transformation, accumulation and detoxification than DOM derived from Rhizosphere soil. The chemical speciation of lead/cadmium and growth efficiency related variations were revealed in the growth process of Calendula officinalis seedlings, and the spectral characteristics of DOM in Rhizosphere loess were discussed with UV, FT-IR and 3D-EEMs spectra. The results showed: the dominant contents of lead/cadmium are in residual and exchangeable speciation, and the exchangeable contents increase greatly after the growth of Calendula of ficinalis seedlings. It causes negative effects on the height and emergency rate of Calendula officinalis seedlings with lead/cadmium, and the Calendula officinalis is able to positively improve loess characteristics. The root of Calendula officinalis appears to be longer, thinner and flexuous. The maximum absorption band of DOM in UV spectra locates in 200 similar to 240 nm, and the sharper and greater intensity of peaks can be detected under lead/cadmium,stress. The absorption peaks in FT-IR spectra move from 3 444 and 1 637 to 3 440 and 1 645 cm(-1), respectively, indicating the combination effects between metal ions and functional groups of-OH and C=O. The dominant fluorescence peaks of DOM are found to be around lambda(ex/em) =240/430, described as fulvic-acid like components, and metals in loess affect more on peaks intensity than locations. The characteristics of DOM in Rhizosphere loess of Calendula officinalis seedlings contain much micro-eco-environmental information, and the spectral approaches are efficient to reveal the relationship between DOM and chemical speciation of lead/cadmium.																	1000-0593					SEP	2016	36	9					2852	2857		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)09-2852-06						WOS:000383306800024		
J	Fan, CH; Chang, M; Zhang, YC				Fan Chun-hui; Chang Min; Zhang Ying-chao			Spectral Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) Derived from Water and Sediment in Normal Flow Period of the Intersection Zone of Jing River and Wei River	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												As the representative component for eco-environmental researchers, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is playing a significant role for the indication effect on environmental quality and efficiency assessment on remediation approaches. Nowadays, it lacks related investigation on DOM derived from rivers and sediments, and the advanced discussion is in urgent need because of the dynamic variations of experimental target, such as spatial-temporal condition, hydrological condition, environmental condition and research dimension. The spectral approaches, including elemental analysis, ultraviolet spectra (UV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectra (Raman), three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEMs) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to reveal the characteristics of DOM derived from water and sediment samples in the intersection zone of Jing River and Wei River (Gaoling District, Xi' an City, Shaanxi Province). The results showed: the ratios of H/C and N/C for DOM in sediment are higher than that of DOM in water, suggesting the saturation degree in DOM from sediment are higher with more content of nitrogen. The UV absorbance of DOM decreases with the increasing of wave length, and obvious absorption region (240 similar to 310 nm) appears in DOM from sediment. The functional groups of -OH, C=C and C-O could be found in DOM from FTIR spectra, and the characteristics might be more complicated in sediment for various peak shapes and intensities. The Raman spectra of DOM in water are similar to that of the sediment. The fluorescence peaks of DOM in water are regarded as visible tryptophane-like and UV fulvic-like components, mainly from terrestrial source; while fluorescence peaks of DOM in sediment belong to UV fulvic-like fluorescence without protein-like fluorescence peaks being detected. The principal carbon chains are similar in DOM samples from water and sediment, and the aliphatic characteristics are more obvious for the latter, which contains more carbohydrate-binding hydrogen than aromatic-binding hydrogen and gamma-H. It proves that DOM in water mainly comes from terrestrial source, and DOM in sediment is more complicated and fresher. The achievements are significant to reveal the microscopic characteristics and environmental behavior of DOM in representative systems.																	1000-0593					SEP	2016	36	9					2863	2869		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)09-2863-07						WOS:000383306800026

In this study, the variation of DOM from the secondary effluent of pulp and paper mill wastewater before and after coagulation was investigated based on hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, apparent molecular weight (MW) and fluorescence. DOM fractions of the secondary effluent were all with the apparent MW <20 kDa. Particularly, the hydrophobic acids (HOA) fraction, mainly composed of humic-like materials, was the major component, and it also had the highest color and SUVA(254) (UV254 to dissolved organic carbon ratio). Hydrophilic bases (HIB) and hydrophilic neutrals (HIN) fractions were the other important parts besides HOA. Coagulation can remove all DOM fractions to different extent, and it was more effective for organic compounds with MW >5 kDa. The removal efficiencies of humic-like, fulvic-like and soluble microbial by-product-like constituents in HOA and HIB fractions were much higher than in other fractions. Even so, the coagulation effluent still contained large amounts of contaminants with complicated fluorophores and apparent MW <5 kDa, and HOA and HIN fractions were also the major parts in the coagulation effluent.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2016	74	6					1346	1353		10.2166/wst.2016.311						WOS:000384222200009		
J	Chen, ML; Jaffe, R				Chen, Meilian; Jaffe, Rudolf			Quantitative assessment of photo- and bio-reactivity of chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter from biomass and soil leachates and from surface waters in a subtropical wetland	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) reactivity plays a central role in ecosystem function and the global carbon cycle. In this study, a suite of biomass and soil leachates together with surface water samples from the Florida coastal Everglades (FCE) were investigated to quantitatively assess the photo- and bio-reactivity of DOM via dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet-visible absorbance (UV-Vis) measurements, and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The decomposition patterns observed were diverse, but dominated by first order decay for most of the samples studied. The reactivity rate constants obtained based on a first order multi-pool kinetic model, suggest that the DOM in the Everglades is largely refractory on time scales relevant to this ecosystem (2 months). The relative reactivity of different fluorescent DOM pools determined as labile, semi-labile and refractory were in the order of biomass leachate > soil leachate > surface water. Photo-reactivity was found to be a more important process in controlling the fate of FDOM in this system, while FDOM was mainly refractory to bio-degradation. Degradation patterns and rate constants for samples of different origin displayed vast differences for the same PARAFAC component, suggesting a complex and heterogeneous composition of fluorophores for each component, most likely the result of different structures, speciation and conformation, and molecular weight distribution. In addition, a terrestrial humic-like and two protein-like components were found to have the potential to serve as indicators of photo-degradable and bioavailable DOM.																	0168-2563	1573-515X				SEP	2016	129	3					273	289		10.1007/s10533-016-0231-7						WOS:000383104700002

Excitation emission matrix data of fluorescence was obtained using spectrophotometric analysis and parallel factor (PARAFAC) model was used to characterize FDOM. The spatiotemporal variation and effect on FDOM were studied using an exploratory analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). According to the spatial and seasonal characteristics, we used post hoc analysis to identify significantly different sites and season. The PARAFAC results identified three most important PARAFAC components explaining 95.32% of total variance of original data-set. Seasons and sites had a significant effect on PARAFAC Components I and II (p0.05), whereas season had a significant effect on Component III (p0.05). There was no significant interaction between seasons and sites for all the three PARAFAC components (p>0.05). For Components I and II, summer season was significantly different from other seasons (p0.05), whereas for Component III, the fall season was significantly different from winter and summer seasons (p0.05). These results indicate that ANOVA and post hoc analysis in our study not only confirmed the results of previous studies, but also revealed differences in seasons and sites for identified FDOMs as a new information. The methodology proposed in this paper can be a useful tool for finding sources and sinks of FDOMs in a riverine system influenced by natural organic matter impairment.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				SEP	2016	57	43					20199	20209		10.1080/19443994.2015.1112978						WOS:000382817300008

However, there is no consensus on the protocols for elucidating DOM fluorescence spectra from protein-like (young DOM) to humic-like (old DOM) types, which are associated with the intrinsic fluorescence properties involved in the excitation/emission and detection of DOM. The central objective of this study was to evaluate the excitation-emissions matrices (EEMs)-average area of fluorescence intensity response using DOM fluorescence spectra collected on six different DOM surrogates using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography techniques. We evaluated criteria and protocols of a new Y fluorescence index (YFI) for comparison with McKnight fluorescence index (MFI), in which 280nm excitation coincides with independent inferences with response to emission wavelengths from 350 to 450nm. Our results demonstrate that YFI had sufficient distinguishing power to evaluate the characteristics of organic matter, including protein- and humic-type substances under various solution conditions. In addition, the YFI has good selectivity by showing its distinct signatures at better resolution of fluorescence intensity and little variation in different solutions including wastewater effluent-derived surface water. Although MFI has the advantage of fulvic acid-oriented correction, it revealed with a narrow spectral overlap range of 0.84-2.14 for DOM characterization of Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA), neomycin trisulphate salt hydrate (NTH), and bovine serum albumin (BSA). This narrow range of FI for DOM surrogate was improved with YFI, implying that all NOM substances fluoresce with considerable proportional ranges of 0.30-6.41. Our results suggest that the YFI values of the DOM surrogate data-set of fluorescence EEMs are likely proportionally lower FI of pahokee peat HA and leonardite HA relative to elliott soil HA, SRHA, and SRFA, while those of NTH, Streptomycin sesquisulfate hydrate, L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, and BSA are higher FI.

In this study, selected DOM from various sources were tested to elucidate the differences between before and after the SPE utilizing multiple analytical tools including fluorescence spectroscopy, FT-ICR-MS, and size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detector (SEC-OCD). The changes of specific UV absorbance indicated the decrease of aromaticity after the SPE, suggesting a preferential exclusion of aromatic DOM structures, which was also confirmed by the substantial reduction of fluorescent DOM (FDOM). Furthermore, SEC-OCD results exhibited very low recoveries (1-9 %) for the biopolymer fraction, implying that PPL needs to be used cautiously in SPE sorbent materials for treating high molecular weight compounds (i.e., polysaccharides, proteins, and amino sugars). A careful examination via FT-ICR-MS revealed that the formulas lost by the SPE might be all DOM source-dependent. Nevertheless, the dominant missing compound groups were identified to be the tannins group with high O/C ratios (> 0.7), lignins/carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), aliphatics with high H/C > 1.5, and heteroatomic formulas, all of which were prevailed by pseudo-analogous molecular formula families with different methylene (-CH2) units. Our findings shed new light on potential changes in the compound composition and the molecular weight of DOM upon the SPE, implying precautions needed for data interpretation.																	1618-2642	1618-2650				SEP	2016	408	23					6249	6258		10.1007/s00216-016-9728-0						WOS:000382681900003	27387996

It is important and necessary to characterize the CDOM in stormwater runoff, which is useful to clarify the relationship between CDOM with the other coexisting organic and/or inorganic components. In this study, 30 stormwater runoff samples were collected from three different stormwater events in a typical residential area in Beijing, and CDOM in the samples was characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy to investigate its compositions, structures, and sources. Being compared to the previous studies on wet precipitation, average molecular weight of CDOM in this study was much larger, implying the presence of more aromatic components with carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl and unsaturated carbon atoms functional groups. Furthermore, both allochthonous and autochthonous sources contributed to the local CDOM, and their chemical properties were influenced by anthropogenic and biogenic factors. Thus, the CDOM in stormwater runoff is a compositionally different matrix than that discovered in wet precipitation.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				SEP	2016	57	42					19727	19740		10.1080/19443994.2015.1106345						WOS:000382746100014

These changes occur over distances of tens of meters (m) implying rapid removal kinetics of the chromophoric DOM that imparts color to groundwater. A one-compartment input-outputmodel was used to derive a differential equation describing the removal of DOM from the dissolved phase due to the combined effects of biodegradation and sorption. The general solution to the equation was parameterized using a 2-year record of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration changes in groundwater at a long-term observation well. Estimated rates of DOC loss were rapid and ranged from 0.093 to 0.21 micromoles per liter per day (mu M d(-1)), and rate constants for DOC removal ranged from 0.0021 to 0.011 per day (d(-1)). Applying these removal rate constants to an advective-dispersion model illustrates substantial depletion of DOC over flow-path distances of 200 m or less and in timeframes of 2 years or less. These results explain the low to moderate DOC concentrations (20-75 mu M; 0.26-1 mg L-1) and ultraviolet absorption coefficient values (a(254)< 5 m(-1)) observed in groundwater produced from 59 wells tapping eight different aquifer systems of the United States. The nearly uniform optical clarity of groundwater, therefore, results from similarly rapid DOM-removal kinetics exhibited by geologically and hydrologically dissimilar aquifers.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2016	24	6					1413	1422		10.1007/s10040-016-1406-y						WOS:000382049400007

The significant differences in the locations of EEM peaks indicated that there were differences in the molecular structures of the MW >5 kDa fraction and the other fractions. FRI indicated that the degree of humification increased with increasing MW for all of the MW fractions, except for the MW >5 kDa fraction, suggesting that FRI was not suitable for analyzing MW fractions with differences in their molecular structures. PARAFAC modeling resulted in three components for the MW >5 kDa fraction and two components for the other MW fractions. Red-shifting occurred in components 1 (Microbial Humic-like) and 2 (Terrestrial Humic-like) as the MW increased. And component 3 was categorized as a protein-like substance. PARAFAC modeling of the MW fractions can isolate more components and resolve more fluorophores than can DOM analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The variation of the partitioning coefficients (K-DOC) of pyrene at different pH levels was examined by florescence quenching titration. Results show that, relative to the more polar acidic DOM-fractions, the hydrophobic neutral fraction exhibits a higher sorption ability to pyrene. Generally, the sorption of pyrene to the three hydrophobic fractions is strongly pH-dependent. The K-DOC values of pyrene generally increase with decreasing pH levels, which is especially obvious in the sorption of pyrene to the fulvic acid fractions, suggesting that the binding is controlled by hydrophobic interactions. The mechanisms underlying the binding of pyrene to the hydrophobic fractions were also discussed. Our data are beneficial to further understanding the binding of HOCs to DOM and how it has been affected, which may result in more accurate predictions of K-DOC.																	2096-0956	2365-7499				SEP	2016	35	3					288	293		10.1007/s11631-016-0094-6						WOS:000381223000008

This study collected groundwater samples from a 20 m deep well throughout 2014 and separated each into three subsamples by ultrafiltration: high molecular weight-DOM (HDOM, 0.45 mu m-10 kDa), medium molecular weight-DOM (MDOM, 10-1 kDa), and low molecular weight-DOM (LDOM, <1 kDa) solutions. The fractional DOM was measured with a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) via fluorescence spectroscopy. A fluorescence quenching method was used to calculate the apparent stability constant (K-s) between arsenic and the fractional DOM. Based on the EEM records, three fluorescence indicators were further calculated to characterize the DOM sources, including the fluorescence index (FI), the biological index (BI), and the humification index (HI). The experimental results indicated that arsenic in the groundwater was mainly partitioned into the MDOM and LDOM fractions. All fractional DOMs contained humic acid-like substances and were considered as microbial sources. LDOM had the highest humification degree and aromaticity, followed by MDOM and HDOM. The As and DOM association could be formed by a Fe-bridge, which was demonstrated by the K-s values and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the DOM. The formation of As-Fe-DOM complex was only significant in the MDOM and LDOM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), colored DOM, and humic-like DOM decreased with increasing salinity (r(2) = 0.70-0.84). Removal of DOM was noticeable at low to mid salinity range, likely due to degradation and/or adsorption to particles. DOM photobleaching rates (i.e., decrease in DOM signal resulting from exposure to solar radiation) ranged from 0.005 to 0.030 h(-1), corresponding to half-lives of 4.9-9.9 days. Dissolved organic matter from the Nelson and Hayes Rivers was more photoreactive than from the estuary where the photodegradation of terrestrial DOM decreased with increasing salinity. Coincident with the loss of CDOM absorption was an increase in spectral slope S, suggesting a decrease in DOM molecular weight Marked differences in photoreactivity of protein-and humic-like DOM were observed with highly humidified material being the most photosensitive. Information generated by our study will provide a valuable data set for better understanding the impacts of future hydroelectric development and climate change on DOM biogeochemical dynamics in the Nelson/Hayes estuary and coastal domain. This study will constitute a reference on terrestrial DOM fate prior to building additional generating capacity on the Nelson River. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To date, few studies have been carried out to investigate how the composition and dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in drinking water lakes are influenced by inflow rate. Such CDOM can lead to unpleasant taste and odor of the water and produce undesirable disinfection byproducts during drinking water treatment. We studied the drinking water Lake Qiandao, China, and found that the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the lake increased significantly with inflow rate (p < 0.001). Similarly, close relationships between inflow rate and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm a(350) and with terrestrial humic-like fluorescence C3 and a negative relationship between inflow rate and the first principal component (PC1) scores, which, in turn, were negatively related to the concentrations and relative molecular size of CDOM (p < 0.001), i.e. the concentration and molecular size of CDOM entering the lake increased proportionately with inflow rate. Furthermore, stable isotopes (delta D and delta O-18) were depleted in the upstream river mouth relative to downstream remaining lake regions, substantiating that riverine CDOM entering the lake was probably driven by inflow rate. This was further underpinned by remarkably higher mean chlorophyll-a and in situ measured terrestrial CDOM fluorescence (365/480 nm) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and notably lower mean PC1 and CDOM spectral slope (S275-295) recorded in the upstream river mouth than in the downstream main lake area. Strong negative correlations between inflow rate and a(250):a(365), S275-295, and the spectral slope ratio (S-R) implied that CDOM input to the lake in rainy period was dominated by larger organic molecules with a more humic-like character. Rainy period, especially rainstorm events, therefore poses a risk to drinking water safety and requires higher removal efficiency of CDOM during drinking water treatment processes.

In this study, the transformation and changes in composition of low molecular weight DOM in water reclamation processes, where secondary effluent of the municipal wastewater treatment plant was further treated by biofiltration, ozonation and chlorination, were investigated by "unknown" screening analysis using Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Orbitrap MS). The intense ions were detected over an m/z range from 100 to 450. In total, 2412 formulae with various heteroatoms were assigned, and formulae with carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) only and C, H, O and sulfur (S) were the most abundant species. During biofiltration, CHO-only compounds with relatively high hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio or with saturated structure were preferentially removed, while CHOS compounds were mostly removed. Ozonation induced the greatest changes in DOM composition. CHOS compounds were mostly decreased after ozonation while ozone selectively removed CHO compounds with relatively unsaturated structure and produced compounds that were more saturated and with a higher degree of oxidation. After chlorination, 168 chlorine-containing formulae, chlorinated disinfection by-products (DBPs), were additionally detected. Candidate DBP precursors were determined by tracking chlorinated DBPs formed via electrophilic substitution, half of which were generated during the ozonation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Two mesocosms experiments were conducted in winter 2010 and summer 2011 to examine how increased pCO(2) and/or nutrient concentrations potentially perturbate dissolved organic matter dynamics in natural microbial assemblages. The fluorescence signals of protein-and humic-like compounds were used as a proxy for labile and non-labile material, respectively, while the evolution of bacterial populations, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were used as a proxy for biological activity. For both seasons, the presence of elevated pCO(2) did not cause any significant change in the DOC dynamics (p-value < 0.05). The conditions that showed the greatest changes in prokaryote abundances and Chl a content were those amended with nutrients, regardless of the change in pH. The temporal evolution of fluorophores and optical indices revealed that the degree of humification of the organic molecules and their molecular weight changed significantly in the nutrient-amended treatment. The generation of protein-like compounds was paired to increases in the prokaryote abundance, being higher in the nutrient-amended tanks than in the control. Different patterns in the magnitude and direction of the generation of humic-like molecules suggested that these changes depended on initial microbial populations and the availability of extra nutrient inputs. Based on our results, it is expected that in the future projected coastal scenarios the eutrophication processes will favor the transformations of labile and recalcitrant carbon regardless of changes in pCO(2).

Nevertheless, water samples are regularly frozen for sample preservation. In this study we tested the effect of different freezing methods (standard freezing at -18 degrees C and fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen) on DOM concentrations measured as organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and on spectroscopic properties of DOM from different terrestrial ecosystems (forest and grassland). Fresh and differently frozen throughfall, stemflow, litter leachate and soil solution samples were analyzed for DOC concentrations, UV-vis absorption and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen prevented a significant decrease of DOC concentrations observed after freezing at -18 degrees C. Nonetheless, the share of PARAFAC components 1 (EXmax < 250 nm (340 nm), EXmax: 480 nm) and 2 (EXmax: 335 nm, EXmax: 408 nm) to total fluorescence and the humification index (HIX) decreased after both freezing treatments, while the shares of component 3 (EXmax: < 250 nm (305 nm), EXmax: 438 nm) as well as SUVA(254) increased. The contribution of PARAFAC component 4 (EXmax: 280 nm, EXmax: 328 nm) to total fluorescence was not affected by freezing. We recommend fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen for preservation of bulk DOC concentrations of samples from terrestrial sources, whereas immediate measuring is preferable to preserve spectroscopic properties of DOM.																	1726-4170	1726-4189				AUG 22	2016	13	16					4697	4705		10.5194/bg-13-4697-2016						WOS:000383791800002

The combination of a UV short-pulse laser (355 nm, 6 ns) for fluorescence excitation with a 10-100 ns short-time synchronous detection using a gated image-intensified multi-channel CCD of the fluorescence made the LIFS lidar operation possible even in daytime. The LIFS lidar with this construction demonstrated the potential of natural river/lake water quality monitoring at the Tenryu River/Lake Suwa. Three main components in the fluorescence data of the water, dissolved organic matter, phycocyanin, and chlorophyll, were extracted by spectral analysis using the standard spectral functions of these components. Their concentrations were estimated by adapting experimentally calibrated data. Results of long-term field observations using our LIFS lidar from 2010 to 2012 show the necessity of simultaneous multi-component detection to understand the natural water environment.

Elemental composition and optical properties reveal changes in dissolved organic matter along a permafrost thaw chronosequence in a subarctic peatland	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The fate of carbon stored in permafrost-zone peatlands represents a significant uncertainty in global climate modeling. Given that the breakdown of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often a major pathway for decomposition in peatlands, knowledge of DOM reactivity under different permafrost regimes is critical for determining future climate feedbacks. To explore the effects of permafrost thaw and resultant plant succession on DOM reactivity, we used a combination of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), UV/Vis absorbance, and excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) to examine the DOM elemental composition and optical properties of 27 pore water samples gathered from various sites along a permafrost thaw sequence in Stordalen Mire, a thawing subarctic peatland in northern Sweden. The presence of dense Sphagnum moss, a feature that is dominant in the intermediate thaw stages, appeared to be the main driver of variation in DOM elemental composition and optical properties at Stordalen. Specifically, DOM from sites with Sphagnum had greater aromaticity, higher average molecular weights, and greater O/C, consistent with a higher abundance of phenolic compounds that likely inhibit decomposition. These compounds are released by Sphagnum and may accumulate due to inhibition of phenol oxidase activity by the acidic pH at these sites. In contrast, sites without Sphagnum, specifically fully-thawed rich fens, had more saturated, more reduced compounds, which were high in N and S. Optical properties at rich fens indicated the presence of microbially-derived DOM, consistent with the higher decomposition rates previously measured at these sites. These results indicate that Sphagnum acts as an inhibitor of rapid decomposition and CH4 release in thawing subarctic peatlands, consistent with lower rates of CO2 and CH4 production previously observed at these sites. However, this inhibitory effect may disappear if Sphagnum-dominated bogs transition to more waterlogged rich fens that contain very little to no living Sphagnum. Release of this inhibition allows for higher levels of microbial activity and potentially greater CH4 release, as has been observed in these fen sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hawkes, JA; Dittmar, T; Patriarca, C; Tranvik, L; Bergquist, J				Hawkes, Jeffrey A.; Dittmar, Thorsten; Patriarca, Claudia; Tranvik, Lars; Bergquist, Jonas			Evaluation of the Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer for the Molecular Fingerprinting Analysis of Natural Dissolved Organic Matter	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												We investigated the application of the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Velos Pro, Thermo Fisher) for resolving complex mixtures of natural aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) and compared this technique to the more established state-of-the-art technique, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS, Bruker Daltonics), in terms of the distribution of molecular masses detected and the reproducibility of the results collected. The Orbitrap was capable of excellent reproducibility: Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between duplicate measurements was 2.85 +/- 0.42% (mean +/- standard deviation). The Orbitrap was also capable of the detection of most major ionizable organic molecules in typical aquatic mixtures, with the exception of most sulfur and phosphorus containing masses. This result signifies that the Orbitrap is an appropriate technique for the investigation of very subtle biogeochemical processing of bulk DOM. The lower costs (purchase and maintenance) and wider availability of Orbitrap mass spectrometers in university departments means that the tools necessary for research into DOM processing at the molecular level should be accessible to a much wider group of scientists than before. The main disadvantage of the technique is that substantially fewer molecular formulas can be resolved from a complex mixture (roughly one third as many), meaning some loss of information. In balance, most biogeochemical studies that aim at molecularly fingerprinting the source of natural DOM could be satisfactorily carried out with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. For more targeted metabolomic studies where individual compounds are traced through natural systems, FTICR-MS remains advantageous.

Growing Algae Alter Spectroscopic Characteristics and Chlorine Reactivity of Dissolved Organic Matter from Thermally-Altered Forest Litters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Previous studies demonstrated that wildfires alter spectroscopic characteristics of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) and increase specific disinfection byproduct formation potential (SDBP-FP). However, it is unclear whether characteristicg.of thermally altered DOM (TA-DOM) are altered by biogeochemical processes (e.g., transformed by growing algae) before entering water treatment facilities. The freshwater green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and blue-green algae Microcystis aeruginosa were separately incubated in the.mixture of cultural medium and pine (Pinus palustris) litter-derived TA-DOMs (50 degrees C, 250 degrees C, and 400 degrees C) over 7 days to demonstrate the effects of algal growth on alterations in SDBP-FP. TA-DOM optical characteristics and SDBP-FP were quantified by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and chlorination-based DBP-FP experiments. After the inoculation with P. subcapitata, TA-DOM aromaticity (indicated by SUVA(254)) increased from 1.19 to 1.90 L/mg/m for 50 degrees C-extract but decreased from 4.95 to 3.75 L/mg/m for 400 degrees C-extract. The fraction of tyrosine-like components decreased from 25.9 to 9.3% for 50 degrees C-extract but increased from 0.9 to 1.3% for 400 degrees C-extract. Same patterns were also observed for M aeruginosa. Growing algae generally increased chlorine reactivities and formations of trihalornethanes, haloacetonitriles, chloral hydrate, and haloketones. Our data suggest that the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon in TA-DOM decreases as fire intensity (i.e., temperature) increases. Postfire algal blooms can increase chlorine reactivity of fire-affected terrestrial DOM for DBP formation.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 2	2016	50	15					7991	8000		10.1021/acs.est.6b01578						WOS:000381063200007	27366813

Investigation of the Coupled Effects of Molecular Weight and Charge-Transfer Interactions on the Optical and Photochemical Properties of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We studied the formation of photochemically produced reactive intermediates (RI) from dissolved organic matter (DOM). Specifically, we focused on the effects of variable molecular weight and chemical reduction on the optical properties of DOM (absorbance and fluorescence) and the formation of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), DOM triplet excited states ((DOM)-D-3*), and the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot). The data are largely evaluated in terms of a charge-transfer (CT) model, but deficiencies in the model to explain the data are pointed out when evident. A total of two sets of samples were studied that were subjected to different treatments; the first set included secondary-treated wastewaters and a wastewater-impacted stream, and the second was a DOM isolate. Treatments included size fractionation and chemical reduction using sodium borohydride. Taken as a whole, the results demonstrate that decreasing molecular weight and borohydride reduction work in opposition regarding quantum efficiencies for O-1(2) and (DOM)-D-3* production but in concert for fluorescence and (OH)-O-center dot production. The optical and photochemical data provide evidence for a limited role of CT interactions occurring in lower molecular -weight DOM molecules. In addition, the data suggest that the observed optical and photochemical properties of DOM are a result of multiple populations of chroinophores and that their relative contribution is changed by molecular-weight fractionation and borohydride reduction.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 2	2016	50	15					8093	8102		10.1021/acs.est.6b02109						WOS:000381063200018	27377760

Microbial metabolism mediates interactions between dissolved organic matter and clay minerals in streamwater	Scientific Reports												Sorption of organic molecules to mineral surfaces is an important control upon the aquatic carbon (C) cycle. Organo-mineral interactions are known to regulate the transport and burial of C within inland waters, yet the mechanisms that underlie these processes are poorly constrained. Streamwater contains a complex and dynamic mix of dissolved organic compounds that coexists with a range of organic and inorganic particles and microorganisms. To test how microbial metabolism and organo-mineral complexation alter amino acid and organic carbon fluxes we experimented with C-13-labelled amino acids and two common clay minerals (kaolinite and montmorillonite). The addition of C-13-labelled amino acids stimulated increased microbial activity. Amino acids were preferentially mineralized by the microbial community, concomitant with the leaching of other (non-labelled) dissolved organic molecules that were removed from solution by clay-mediated processes. We propose that microbial processes mediate the formation of organo-mineral particles in streamwater, with potential implications for the biochemical composition of organic matter transported through and buried within fluvial environments.

Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as a tracer of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) becomes more valuable in elucidating the source and compositions of DOM. Although measurements of DOM in the Arctic Ocean have been widely reported, characteristics of high molecular weight colloids are still poorly understood. In this study, the bulk absorbance and size fractograms of CDOM were measured in the Chukchi Seas using an asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled online with UV-vis detectors. Both CDOM a(254), absorption coefficient at 254 nm, and the integrated UV254 (from AF4 UV-vis detector) of three colloidal fractions (1-10, 10-100, and >100 kDa) significantly correlated with the fraction of meteoric water (f(mw)) calculated from delta O-18 in seawater, which indicates that the CDOM was mainly derived from terrestrial input and a(254) is a potential tracer of tDOM in the Chukchi Sea. Compared with the larger colloidal fractions (10-100 and > 100 kDa), the smaller colloidal fraction (1-10 kDa) showed a stronger correlation with the fmw, suggesting the smaller colloids were of mostly terrigenous origin. Values of field measured spectral slope at 275-295 nm (s(275-295)), a tDOM proxy, were significantly lower than the model-estimated s(275-295) calculated from the MODIS Aqu satellite remote sensing data, which indicated that terrestrial input of CDOM derived from model calculation was likely underestimated in the Chukchi Sea.

Characterization of bulk and chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Laurentian Great Lakes during summer 2013	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Laurentian Great Lakes contain similar to 21% of the Earth's surface freshwater and are experiencing dramatic decadal-scale changes to their water quality, biogeochemistry and ecosystem functions We report here the first data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (DOM), including UV-visible absorbance and derived optical properties and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), for open-lakesurface waters from each of the Great Lakes. Concentrations of DOC ranged from 86 to 240 mu mol/L and the absorption coefficient at 254 nm (a(254)) varied from 2.67 to 10.47 m(-1) in Great Lakes waters. UV-visible and fluorescence characterization indicated that the DOM in open-lake waters in all the Great Lakes was primarily autochthonous. Both DOC and a(254) increased from Lake Superior to Lakes Erie and Ontario where aromaticity, molecular weight and humification degree of DOM were also higher. These variations are consistent with both the water transport pathway and the trend of increasing human population and relative watershed drainage area along the Great Lakes. Parallel factor analysis on fluorescence-EEM data revealed three terrestrial humic-likeDOM components (C1, C2 and C4) and one protein-likeDOM component (C3). Open Lake Huron had the highest protein-like/humic-like DOM ratio (C3/C1), while sites in Lakes Erie and Ontario had lower C3/C1 ratios, indicating a greater proportional influence of terrestrial DOM. Changes in DOM composition along the water transport pathway in the Great Lakes indicate varying impacts from terrestrial inputs and human activities in the different lake systems.

The potential role of sea ice melt in the distribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in sea ice and the underlying water column in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Pacific Arctic region and its relationship with both physical and biogeochemical parameters. Sea ice, water and melt pond samples were collected as sea ice melted in June-July 2010 and 2011. CDOM absorption was found to be significantly lower in sea ice compared to under-ice waters. In particular, the average CDOM absorption coefficient at 254 rim was approximately four times greater in the underlying water column than in the overlying ice. This indicates that melting sea ice did not contribute to net CDOM at this point in the melt season, but rather diluted CDOM in the under-ice water column. In the 2011 under-ice water column samples, the average CDOM absorption coefficients at 440 nm were twice as high along a transect associated with high phytoplankton biomass, which may have been contributed through subsequent microbial generation of CDOM. Less extensive sea ice cover with melt ponds may also have increased the presence of CDOM owing to increases in light transmission, leading to under-ice phytoplankton blooms and associated microbial production. However, oxygen isotope analysis of these waters with high under-ice phytoplankton biomass also indicates the presence of prior sea ice melt, including potentially sea ice algae and microbes, which could have also contributed to this anomalously high CDOM. These observations suggest that while melting sea ice may not necessarily contribute to increased CDOM concentrations, there are circumstances where CDOM in underlying waters may be higher than expected, either due to enhanced light transmission and higher under-ice production, and/or prior ice melt that provided significant contributions to under-ice CDOM.

J	Yao, YL; Zhao, WH; Miao, H				Yao Yi-liang; Zhao Wei-hong; Miao Hui			Studied on Colored Dissolved Organic Matter of Spring in North Yellow Sea with Three-Dimensional Fluorescence Spectroscopy Combined with Parallel Factor Analysis	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												This paper conducted fluorescent spectra of dissolved organic matter of Spring China North Yellow Sea by using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (EEMs) combined with parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC). The results showed that the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) of North Yellow Sea could be resolved to four components. Two components, cl (260,315/425) and c2 (295,355/490) were identified as humic-like fluorescence components while c3 (275/310) and c4 (230, 290/345) were protein-like components. The different linear correlations showed different degrees of similarities in the source or the chemical constitution, the relationship of the humic-like fluorescence components were most closely, followed by protein-like components. Four fluorescent components and total fluorescence intensity (TFI) in the horizontal and vertical directions had a higher intensity in coastal area than that of the area far away from the coast. Additionally, besides terrestrial input, the seawater mass movement also affects the distribution of CDOM in North Yellow Sea. Cluster analysis not only further illustrated the TFI characteristics of different areas of the North Yellow Sea, but also reflects the overall uniformity of the CDOM. Fluorescence Index (FI), Humification Index (HIX) and Biological Index (BIX) at some extent indicated the source of North Yellow Sea CDOM and the conclusion was that the near shore side gets greater influence from terrigenous sources while the sea side is more impacted by biological activity, which matched with the prior distribution patterns of fluorescence components.																	1000-0593					AUG	2016	36	8					2532	2537		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)08-2532-06						WOS:000382096600029

Response of sediment bacterial communities to temporal variation in the dissolved organic matter pool of an agriculturally impacted stream	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Changes in biotic and abiotic variables in streams can drive shifts in microbial community composition and function. In this study, we uncovered temporal patterns in bacterial OTU richness and enzyme activities in the sediment of an agriculturally impacted stream that were driven by seasonal changes in stream discharge, nitrogen (N) availability, fractions of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool, and algal biomass, using molecular techniques and enzymatic assays (substrate analogues linked to fluorescent molecules). Overall, DOM composition (especially labile DOC) was strongly influenced by high algal growth in June and August, which was driven by high discharge and N availability in April and June. These factors resulted in increased bacterial abundances in both stream water and sediment in June and August. However, periods of high activities (June) of the enzymes a-glucosidase (AG), beta-glucosidase (BG), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and leucine amino peptidase (LAMP) in stream sediments did not coincide with high OTU richness, since this was lowest in June. Bacterial community structure and the measured activities of these four enzymes appeared unrelated perhaps because various organisms (bacteria, fungi, algae) produce enzymes. However, enzyme changes reflect resource availability and presumably may be related to bacterial communities indirectly. Consistent with this idea, high laccase activity and OTU richness co-occurred in September and were attributed to increasing humic DOC fractions (as algal biomass decreases and labile DOC was exhausted). Overall, our results suggest that microbe-mediated nitrogen and carbon transformations by sediment microbial communities of an agriculturally impacted stream are heavily impacted by seasonal variations in biotic (algal biomass) and abiotic (discharge, N input) factors that characterize such streams.																	1863-9135					AUG	2016	188	3					171	185		10.1127/fal/2016/0911						WOS:000381324600001

The influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on sodium regulation and nitrogenous waste excretion in the zebrafish (Danio rerio)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is both ubiquitous and diverse in composition in natural waters, but its effects on the branchial physiology of aquatic organisms have received little attention relative to other variables (e.g. pH, hardness, salinity, alkalinity). Here, we investigated the effects of four chemically distinct DOM isolates (three natural, one commercial, ranging from autochthonous to highly allochthonous, all at similar to 6 mg C l(-1)) on the physiology of gill ionoregulation and nitrogenous waste excretion in zebrafish acclimated to either circumneutral (7.0-8.0) or acidic pH (5.0). Overall, lower pH tended to increase net branchial ammonia excretion, net K+ loss and [H-3] PEG-4000 clearance rates (indicators of transcellular and paracellular permeability, respectively). However, unidirectional Na+ efflux, urea excretion and drinking rates were unaffected. DOM sources tended to stimulate unidirectional Na+ influx rate and exerted subtle effects on the concentration-dependent kinetics of Na+ uptake, increasing maximum transport capacity. All DOM sources reduced passive Na+ efflux rates regardless of pH, but exerted negligible effects on nitrogenous waste excretion, drinking rate, net K+ loss or [H-3] PEG-4000 clearance, so the mechanism of Na+ loss reduction remains unclear. Overall, these actions appear beneficial to ionoregulatory homeostasis in zebrafish, and some may be related to physicochemical properties of the DOM sources. They are very different from those seen in a recent parallel study on Daphnia magna using the same DOM isolates, indicating that DOM actions may be both species and DOM specific.				Smith, D.

Alluvial ground water influences dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry of pools within intermittent dryland streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry of intermittent rivers is affected by periods of disconnection and drying after cessation of surface flow, with a pronounced concentration of solutes as pools evaporate and contract. However, inputs of alluvial ground water to stream pools may offset the effects of evaporation and influence the quantity and composition of DOM. We used O-18 and H-2 values of surface water and alluvial ground water (AW) together with DOM fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy to investigate changes in DOM biogeochemistry of pools from four intermittent streams in semi-arid north-west Australia. Our objective was to determine whether the fluorescence characteristics of DOM in pools are driven by their connectivity to alluvial ground water. Pool water O-18 values ranged from -8 to 13.1 and showed progressive enrichment as pools became disconnected from AW and subsequently evaporated. Parallel factor analysis of DOM fluorescence revealed that DOM in pools was generally dominated by humic-like components, with lesser contributions from tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like components. DOC concentrations were higher in more evaporated pools. Humic-like and tryptophan-like DOM were also highest in pools isolated from AW, suggesting that inputs of AW had a dilution effect while also moderating evaporative concentration of solutes. In contrast, tyrosine-like DOM was only weakly correlated with the hydrological status of pools. The proportion that each component contributed to total DOM fluorescence remained mostly consistent across both AW-connected and evaporating pools. However, some pools with AW throughflow had higher contributions from tyrosine-like fluorescence and lower contributions from humic-like fluorescence. Disconnection from AW and subsequent evaporative concentration of solutes is an importantcontrol on DOM fluorescence characteristics in these intermittent streams. However, production and removal of DOM were only rarely influenced by AW connectivity, likely reflecting the high hydrological variability of intermittent rivers, even following cessation of surface flow.

J	Kim, J; Kim, G				Kim, Jeonghyun; Kim, Guebuem			Significant anaerobic production of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the deep East Sea (Sea of Japan)	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The distribution of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) was examined by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Humic-like FDOM (FDOMH) increased with depth and was significantly correlated with Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU), indicating that FDOMH in the deep water is mainly produced by oxidation of organic matter. In addition, a surprisingly large excess of FDOMH relative to that expected from the observed AOU was found from 1000m to the bottom (up to 3500m). Based on the high-resolution geographical distribution and characteristics of FDOM in the East Sea, we conclude that this excess likely originates from anaerobic FDOMH production in subsurface bottom sediments. This FDOMH flux accounts for 8-15% of the total FDOM production in the water column. Our results suggest that anaerobic activities in subsurface sediments are an important hidden source of FDOM in the ocean.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				JUL 28	2016	43	14					7609	7616		10.1002/2016GL069335						WOS:000383290200039

Our study compares analyses of Hg species in highly Hg-contaminated groundwater (Hg-tot: 0.02-4 mu mol.L-1) at three sites with predictions of Hg speciation obtained from three geochemical codes (WHAM, Visual MINTEQ, PHREEQC) with and without implementstion of Hg complexation by dissolved organic matter (DOM). Samples were analyzed for chemical composition, elemental, inorganic, and DOM-bound Hg (Hg(0), Hg-morg, Hg-DOM). Hg-DOM complexation was modeled using three approaches: binding to humic/fulvic acids, binding to thiol-groups, or a combination of both. Results of Hg(0) modeling were poor in all scenarios. Prediction accuracy for Hg-morg and Hg-DOM strongly depended on the assumed DOM composition. Best results were achieved when weaker binding sites, simulated by WHAMs DOM submodel, were combined with strongly binding thiol groups. Indications were found that thiol-DOM ratios in groundwater are likely to be lower than in surface water, highlighting the need for analytical thiol quantification in groundwater DOM. This study shows that DOM quality is a crucial parameter for prediction of Hg speciation in groundwater by means of geochemical modeling.

Suwannee River water was selected to systematically study the effects of critical SPE variables such as loading mass, concentration, flow rate, and up-scaling on the extraction selectivity of the PPL sorbent. High-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy were performed to interpret the DOM chemical space of eluates, as well as permeates and-wash liquids with molecular resolution. Up to 89% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recovery was obtained with a DOC/PPL mass ratio of 1:800 at a DOC concentration of 20 mg/L. With the 0 application of larger loading volumes, low proportions of highly oxygenated compounds were retained on the PPL sorbent. The effects of the flow rate on the extraction selectivity of the sorbent were marginal. Up-scaling had a limited effect on the extraction selectivity with the exception of increased self-esterification with a methanol solvent, resulting in methyl ester groups. Furthermore, the SPE/PPL extract exhibited highly authentic characteristics in comparison with original water and reverse osmosis samples. These findings will be useful for reproducibly isolating DOM with representative molecular compositions from various sources and concentrations and minimizing potential inconsistencies among interlaboratory comparative studies.

J	Sulzberger, B; Arey, JS				Sulzberger, Barbara; Arey, J. Samuel			Impacts of Polar Changes on the UV-induced Mineralization of Terrigenous Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Local climates in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere are influenced by Arctic Amplification and by interactions of the Antarctic ozone hole with climate change, respectively. Polar changes may affect hydroclimatic conditions in temperate regions, for example, by increasing the length and intensity of precipitation events at Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Additionally, global warming has led to the thawing of ancient permafrost soils, particularly in Arctic regions, due to Arctic Amplification. Both heavy precipitation events and thawing of permafrost are increasing the net transfer of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) from land to surface waters. In aquatic ecosystems, UV-induced oxidation of terrigenous DOM (tDOM) produces atmospheric CO2 and this process is one of several mechanisms by which natural organic matter in aquatic and soil environments may play an important role in climate feedbacks. The Arctic is particularly affected by these processes: for example, melting of Arctic sea ice allows solar UV radiation to penetrate into the ice-free Arctic Ocean and to cause photochemical reactions that result in bleaching and mineralization of tDOM. Open questions, in addition to those shown in the Graphical Abstract, remain regarding the resulting contributions of tDOM photomineralization to CO2 production and global warming.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 5	2016	50	13			SI		6621	6631		10.1021/acs.est.5b05994						WOS:000379366300007	27110903

The reduction of As(V) (10-13%) and Fe(III) (12-17%) were partly in response to biochar abiotically causing desorption and reduction effect, but were predominantly (87-90% and 83-88% for As(V) and Fe(III)) attributed to biochar stimulating biological reduction. The level of As(III) released from sediment upon biochar amendment (656.35 +/- 89.25 mu g L-1) was significantly higher than the level released without biochar amendment (98.06 +/- 19.38 mu g L-1) after 49 days incubation. Although a low level of Fe(II) (0.81 +/- 0.07 mg L-1) was determined in the solution when amending with biochar, most of released Fe(II) (166.25 +/- 40.25 mg L-1) was formed as biochar-Fe(II)minerals composite. More importantly, biochar stimulated the DOM bioavailability in association with bacterial activities mediating As(V) and Fe(III) reduction. High-throughput sequencing results indicated biochar application shifted the soil microbial community and increased the relative abundance of As(V)-/Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, mostly Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Desulfosporosinus and Pedobacter. The discovery of biochar-bacteria-DOM consortium may broaden new understanding into speciation and mobilization of metals, which arouses attention to exploit feasible bioremediation for metal-contaminated sediment.

J	Shen, Y; Fichot, CG; Liang, SK; Benner, R				Shen, Yuan; Fichot, Cedric G.; Liang, Sheng-Kang; Benner, Ronald			Biological hot spots and the accumulation of marine dissolved organic matter in a highly productive ocean margin	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and major biochemicals (amino acids and carbohydrates) were measured during five cruises (2009-2010) to the Louisiana margin in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Concentrations of amino acids and carbohydrates were elevated at mid-salinities and were indicative of plankton production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters. Hot spots of two compositionally distinct types of labile DOM were identified based on the relative abundances of amino acids and carbohydrates. Amino acid-rich hot spots occurred sporadically in regions of high phytoplankton biomass and were mostly observed between dusk and dawn, reflecting a grazing source. In contrast, carbohydrate-rich hot spots were more widespread and were often found in nutrient-poor waters, indicating the production of carbon-rich DOM associated with nutrient limitation. Major biochemical indicators and bioassay experiments indicated labile DOM comprised a relatively small fraction of the DOC. Most DOM was degraded and had a semi-labile nature. Substantial accumulations of marine (plankton-derived) DOC were observed in surface waters, particularly at mid-salinities during the summer. Microbial alteration of marine DOC and nutrient limitation of microbial utilization of carbon-rich DOM appeared largely responsible for the accumulation of DOC. The reservoir of accumulated marine DOC in the shelf surface mixed layer ranged from 0.11 Tg C to 0.23 Tg C, with the lowest and highest values occurring during winter and summer. Substantial cross-shelf export of semi-labile marine DOM occurred during the summer and provided a major carbon and energy subsidy to microbial food webs in offshore waters.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2016	61	4					1287	1300		10.1002/lno.10290						WOS:000383622900011

Sediment microbial communities rely on different dissolved organic matter sources along a Mediterranean river continuum	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Heterotrophic bacteria play a key role in the degradation of organic matter and carbon cycling in river sediments. These bacterial communities are directly influenced by environmental variables that differ spatially and temporally in rivers. Here, we studied the longitudinal patterns of sediment bacterial community composition and dissolved organic matter utilization under base flow and drought conditions in a Mediterranean river. Our results indicated that sediment microbial communities were affected by dissolved organic matter quality and origin along the river continuum. In headwaters the potential degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose was greater (i.e., higher beta-glucosidase and beta-xylosidase activities), suggesting higher microbial utilization of allochthonous detritus from terrestrial origin. Conversely, the accumulation and transport of more recalcitrant compounds (i.e., decrease in the recalcitrant index) became potentially relevant downstream. Furthermore, discharge fluctuations had clear effects on bacterial community composition and dissolved organic matter use. The hydrological fragmentation of the river continuum during drought period generated sediment microhabitats dominated by gamma and delta-Proteobacteria, with a greater potential capacity to degrade a wide range of compounds, particularly nitrogen containing moieties. During base flow conditions, we observed a higher occurrence of alpha-Proteobacteria and a greater potential use of more recalcitrant carbon compounds, mostly of terrestrial origin. Overall, our findings suggest an upstream-downstream longitudinal transition of sediment microbial communities that rely on allochthonous to autochthonous dissolved organic matter, and a shift toward autochthonous dissolved organic matter reliance during drought.

Effects of compositional changes on reactivity continuum and decomposition kinetics of lake dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												To address the link between the composition and decomposition of freshwater dissolved organic matter (DOM), we manipulated the DOM from three boreal lakes using preincubations with UV light to cleave large aromatic molecules and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to remove colored phenolic compounds. Subsequently, we monitored the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss over 4months of microbial degradation in the dark to assess how compositional changes in DOM affected different aspects of the reactivity continuum, including the distribution of the apparent decay coefficients. We observed profound effects on decomposition kinetics, with pronounced shifts in the relative share of rapidly and more slowly decomposing fractions of the DOM. In the UV-exposed treatment initial apparent decay coefficient k(0) was almost threefold higher than in the control. Significantly higher relative DOC loss in the UV-exposed treatment was sustained for 2months of incubation, after which decay coefficients converged with those in the control. The PVP removed compounds with absorbance and fluorescence characteristics representative of aromatic compounds, which led to slower decomposition, compared to that in the control. Our results demonstrate the reactivity continuum underlying the decomposition of DOM in freshwaters and highlight the importance of intrinsic properties of DOM in determining its decomposition kinetics.																	2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2016	121	7					1733	1746		10.1002/2016JG003359						WOS:000382581900002

Impact of seasonality and anthropogenic impoundments on dissolved organic matter dynamics in the Klamath River (Oregon/California, USA)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Rivers play a major role in the transport and processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Disturbances that impact DOM dynamics, such as river impoundments and flow regulation, have consequences for biogeochemical cycling and aquatic ecosystems. In this study we examined how river impoundments and hydrologic regulation impact DOM quantity and quality by tracking spatial and seasonal patterns of DOM in a large, regulated river (Klamath River, USA). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased downstream and longitudinal patterns in DOC load varied by season. Export of DOM (as DOC) was largely driven by river flow, while DOM composition was strongly influenced by impoundments. Seasonal algal blooms in upstream lentic reaches provided a steady source of algal DOM that was processed in downstream reaches. DOM at upstream sites had an average spectral slope ratio (S-R)>1, indicating algal-derived material, but decreased downstream to an average S-R<1, more indicative of terrestrial-derived material. The increasingly terrestrial nature of DOM exported from reservoirs likely reflects degraded algal material that becomes increasingly more recalcitrant with distance from upstream source and additional processing. As a result, DOM delivered to free-flowing river reaches below impoundments was less variable in composition. Downstream of impoundments, tributary influences resulted in increasing contributions of terrestrial DOM from the surrounding watershed. Removal of the four lower dams on the Klamath River is scheduled to proceed in the next decade. These results suggest that management should consider the role of impoundments on altering DOM dynamics, particularly in the context of dam removal.																	2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2016	121	7					1946	1958		10.1002/2016JG003497						WOS:000382581900017

The present study examined the effects of DOM derived from commercial organic fertilizers (COF), cow manure (COM) and chicken manure (CHM), on uptake and translocation of lead (Pb) in Brassica chinensis in a pot experiment. The results indicate that DOM derived from CHM (DOMCHM) significantly increased Pb concentrations in roots of B. chinensis (p < 0.05). By contrast, there was no significant increase in shoot Pb concentration for all the DOM treatments except the high DOMCHM treatment in the soil with 800 mg.k(-1) Pb. Consistent with the Pb concentrations in shoots, translocation factor of Pb from soil to shoot and specific lead uptake (SLU) by B. chinensis were significantly increased for the high DOMCHM treatment in the high Pb soil, but not for other DOM treatments. Based on the results of this study, the application of DOM to the soil with 800 mg.k(-1) Pb could result in an increase in total Pb annually ingested by the inhabitants of Nanjing City in the range of 2018-9640 kg, with the highest estimates resulting from the high DOMCHM treatment. This study suggests the risk may rise under some conditions as indicated in the high DOMCHM treatment and high Pb pollution level.																	1660-4601					JUL	2016	13	7							687	10.3390/ijerph13070687						WOS:000380759800063

In this work, water samples collected from Chenjiang, Liuyang, and Xiangjiang River, the most heavily As-contaminated rivers in China, were investigated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), as well as three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). By EEM-PARAFAC modeling, all EEM peaks could be decomposed into a five-component model including: one fulvic acid-like component, one tryptophan-like component, and three humic-like components. Using SEC-ICP-MS, arsenite, arsenate, arsenobetaine, and DOM-bound As were eluted and detected according to different molecular weights, and the co-elution of Fe-56 and DOM-bound As under the same elution condition indicated the complexation between DOM and As through Fe ions. Furthermore, obvious quenching effects of fluorescent DOM components in the presence of As(III) were observed, suggesting that strong complexation or adsorption occurred between As(III) and different DOM components. Among five DOM components identified by PARAFAC, the humic-like components played a key role in forming complexes with As(III), thus leading to the changes of As species in natural water. The results exhibited considerable implications for the role of DOM components on the mobilization and speciation of As, which could be applied to the As removal in natural water and act as an indicator to evaluate the capacity of As complexation or adsorption in the environment.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				JUL	2016	44	7					818	828		10.1002/clen.201500610						WOS:000379942400010

Here, we examined the community response of free-living heterotrophic bacteria, with respect to cellular nucleic acid levels, to the DOMP lysates derived from three phytoplankton strains in the open tropical Pacific. The free amino acid (FAA) composition of each DOMP lysate differed among the microalgal strains. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism analyses with 16S rRNA genes revealed that the community shifts of high nucleic acid (HNA) and low nucleic acid (LNA) bacteria varied significantly with the different DOMP lysate treatments. Furthermore, the FAA composition in DOMP lysates significantly affected the bacterial community shifts in HNA and LNA. Similarity percentage analysis using 16S rRNA gene deep-sequencing revealed that the DOMP lysates from the pelagophyte Pelagomonas calceolata caused relatively large community shifts with Alcaligenes predominating in the HNA fraction. In contrast, the DOMP lysate from the diatom Thalassiosira oceanica induced a community shift in the LNA fraction with a predominance of uncultured Actinobacteria. Thus, the data indicate that the DOMP lysates from different microalgae constitute a primary factor altering the dominant bacterial groups in the open ocean.																	0168-6496	1574-6941				JUL	2016	92	7							fiw099	10.1093/femsec/fiw099						WOS:000379693700010

Fresh algae and leaf litter extracts DOM, one riverine DOM, and one upstream lacustrine DOM were selected for the comparison. C18 sorbent was generally found to extract more diverse molecular formula, relatively higher molecular weight, and more heteroatomic DOM compounds within the studied mass range than PPL sorbent except for the leaf litter extract. Even with the same sorbent, the main molecular features of the two end member DOM were distributed on different sides of the axes of a multivariate ordination, indicating the source-dependent characteristics of the recoverable compounds by the sorbents. In addition, further examination of the molecular formula uniquely present in the two end members and the upstream lake DOM suggested that proteinaceous, tannin-like, and heteroatomic DOM constituents might be potential compound groups which are labile and easily degraded during their mobilization into downstream watershed. This study provides new insights into the sorbent selectivity of DOM from diverse sources and potential lability of various compound groups.																	1618-2642	1618-2650				JUL	2016	408	17					4809	4819		10.1007/s00216-016-9569-x						WOS:000378725200029	27117255

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationships between the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) of microorganisms in swine effluent. For all samples examined, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) were decreased by an average of 58.2 +/- 30.4 and 49.2 +/- 38.7 %, whereas total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) exhibited an average final accumulation of 141.5 +/- 43.0 %. In the original samples, ammonium nitrogen accounted for 88.9 +/- 4.9 % of the TDN, which was reduced to a final average of 83.9 +/- 9.6 %. Two protein-like (tyrosine and tryptophan) and two humic-like (fulvic acids and humic acids) components were identified using a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix. With the increase in incubation time, the relative concentrations of two protein-like components in effluent were reduced by an average of 83.2 +/- 24.7 %. BIOLOG((TM)) ECO plates were used to determine the metabolic fingerprint of the bacterial community, and a shift in the utilization patterns of substrates was observed over the study period. Additionally, the Shannon-Wiener index of CLPP was ultimately reduced by an average of 43.5 +/- 8.5 %, corresponding to the metabolic diversity of the bacterial community. The redundancy analysis identified significant relationships between environmental parameters and the CLPP of microorganisms. To a certain degree, the DOM compositions were linked with the substrate utilization patterns of the bacterial community during the degradation of organic matter in swine effluent.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2016	23	13					13498	13507		10.1007/s11356-016-6536-1						WOS:000378817300084	27030235	
J	Fu, QL; He, JZ; Blaney, L; Zhou, DM				Fu, Qing-Long; He, Jian-Zhou; Blaney, Lee; Zhou, Dong-Mei			Roxarsone binding to soil-derived dissolved organic matter: Insights from multi-spectroscopic techniques	CHEMOSPHERE												The fate and transport of roxarsone (ROX), a widely used organoarsenic feed additive, in soil is significantly influenced by the ubiquitous presence of soil-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, fluorescence quenching titration and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) were employed to study ROX binding to DOM. Binding mechanisms were revealed by fluorescence lifetime measurement and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Humic-and protein-like fluorophores were identified in the excitation-emission matrix and synchronous fluorescence spectra of DOM. The conditional stability constant (log K-c) for ROX binding to DOM was found to be 5.06, indicating that ROX was strongly bound to DOM. The binding order of ROX to DOM fluorophores revealed by 2D-COS followed the sequence of protein-like fluorophore approximate to the longer wavelength excited humic-like (L-humic-like) fluorophore > the shorter wavelength excited humic-like (S-humic-like) fluorophore. 2D-COS resolved issues with peak overlapping and allowed further exploration of the interaction between ROX and DOM. Results of fluorescence lifetime and FTIR spectra demonstrated that ROX interacted with DOM through the hydroxyl, amide II, carboxyl, aliphatic CH, and -NO2 groups, yielding stable DOM-ROX complexes. The strong interaction between ROX and DOM implies that DOM plays an important role in the environmental fate of ROX in soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Combining parallel factor analysis and machine learning for the classification of dissolved organic matter according to source using fluorescence signatures	CHEMOSPHERE												Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence has facilitated a surge of investigation into its biogeochemical cycling. However, rigorous, PARAFAC-based methods for holistically distinguishing DOM sources are lacking. This study classified 1029 PARAFAC-analyzed excitation emission matrices (EEMs) measured using DOM isolated from 24 different leaf leachates, rivers, and organic matter standards using four machine learning methods (MLM). EEMs were also divided into subsets to assess the impact of experimental treatments (i.e. whole EEMs, size fractionation, mixtures, quenching) and dataset properties (i.e. different numbers of EEMs from each leachate/river) on classification. A split-half validated, 10-component PARAFAC model was extended to 12 components to remove consistent peaks evident in model residuals. The 12-component model performed better than the 10 component model, correctly classifying up to 80 additional EEM5, when the dataset included size fractionated DOM or several different sources (i.e. many leaf species and rivers); however, the 10 component model performed better for whole-sample EEMs when comparing leaf leachates to rivers. The MLM correctly classified whole EEMs of riverine DOM by source with up to 87.0% accuracy, leachates with up to 92.5% accuracy, and distinguished leachates from rivers with 97.2% accuracy. A difference of up to 17.3% in classification accuracy was observed depending on the MLM method used with the following order: multilayer perceptron = support vector machine > k-nearest neighbours >> decision tree; however, performances differed widely depending on the data subset. Classification accuracy for whole and size-fractionated rivers compared to whole and size-fractionated leachates using N-way partial least-squares discriminant analysis (NPLS-DA; 97.7%) was similar to that achieved using MLM. Combining MLM with PARAFAC is an effective method for classifying DOM based on its fluorescence signature because PARAFAC can isolate meaningful fluorescent species and unlike PLSDA, MLM constructs a single model which simultaneously classifies EEM5 as belonging to one of several categories. A complete accounting of carbon flows through ecosystems should include the processes and sources that contribute to the disparate fluorescence signatures of riverine and leached DOM.

Herein, we report the effects of two natural organic matter (NOM) sources, Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA), on BDE-153 photolysis in water. The rate constant (k) and half-life of BDE-153 was 2.26 x 10(-2) min(-1) and 30.72 min under UV-Vis irradiation (direct photolysis at) lambda > 290 nm). The k value for BDE-153 decreased markedly in the presence of NOM with a larger decrease in the presence of PLFA than SRFA. Electron spin resonance (ESR) demonstrated generation of free radicals in the photolytic process that mainly involved 102 and center dot OH. The biomolecular k values for reaction of O-1(2) and center dot OH with BDE-153 were 3.65 x 10(6) and 7.70 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The contribution of center dot OH (28.7-31.0%) to the indirect photolysis of BDE-153 was higher than for O-1(2) (12.9-14.9%). The photolytic rate of BDE-153 in oxygen-rich (aerated) solution was much slower than in oxygen-poor (nitrogensparged) conditions, demonstrating that (NOM)-N-3* is a more effective reagent for degradation of BDE-153 than O-1(2). Addition of sorbic acid (a (NOM)-N-3* quencher) significantly reduced the photolytic rate of BDE-153 confirming the important role of (NOM)-N-3* in indirect photolysis. In the presence of NOM, BDE-153 indirect photolysis was facilitated mainly by reaction with (NOM)-N-3* and center dot OH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive investigation of indirect photolysis of BDE-153 in water containing NOM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Stutter, MI; Cains, J				Stutter, Marc I.; Cains, Jonathan			The mineralisation of dissolved organic matter recovered from temperate waterbodies during summer	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) has many forms in freshwaters, controlling C availability for heterotrophic respiration and ecosystem functions in headwaters and downstream ecosystems. This study aimed to examine the respiration of DOM recovered using reverse osmosis (RO) during extended summer baseflow from a parkland Pond (DOMPond) and three headwater rivers: moorland (DOMMoor), mixed agriculture (DOMAgr) and predominantly moorland system with mixed riparian forest (DOMForest), and compared to glucose and soil-derived fulvic acid. Batch decomposition tests at time points up to 379 h were completed in a replicated 96-well micro-plate system (MicroResp) spiking river sediments carrying a standardised microbial inoculum with C sources at two concentrations (1513 and 30 A mu gC/g sediment dry matter). Respiration rates were greatest initially and declined over time with an exponential form. Total C respired (38-80 %, following subtraction of basal respiration controls) for the high C treatment followed: DOMForest > DOMAgr > DOMMoor > DOMPond > Fulvic acid. A similar order occurred at the low C treatment but BDOC > 100 % was evidence that added DOM primed respiration of the sediment C above that of basal controls. Despite issues of high background salt concentrations in the DOM matrix caused by the RO procedure results show that even under summer baseflow conditions DOM can be highly labile. Labile C generated especially from agricultural catchments and those with riparian forests may be conveyed downstream to fresh and estuarine waters to control ecological processes at critical times of the year.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2016	78	3					447	462		10.1007/s00027-015-0446-z						WOS:000377360200004

Reactivity of dissolved organic matter in response to acid deposition	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fluvial export of organic matter from the terrestrial catchment to the aquatic system is a large and increasing carbon flux. The successful reduction in sulfuric acid deposition since the 1980s has been shown to enhance the mobility of organic matter in the soil, with more terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) reaching aquatic systems. Changes in soil acidity also affect the quality of the DOM. In this study we explore the consequences this may have on the reactivity and turnover of the terrestrially derived DOM as it reaches the aquatic system. DOM of different quality (estimated by absorbance, fluorescence and size exclusion chromatography) was produced through extraction of boreal forest O-horizon soils from podzol at two sulfuric acid concentrations corresponding to natural throughfall in spruce forest in Southern Sweden around 1980 and today. Extraction was done using two different methods, i.e. field leaching and laboratory extraction. The DOM extracts were used to assess if differences in acidity generate DOM of different reactivity. Three reactivity experiments were performed: photodegradation by UV exposure, biodegradation by bacteria, and biodegradation after UV exposure. Reactivity was assessed by measuring loss of dissolved organic carbon and absorbance, change in fluorescence and molecular weight, and bacterial production. DOM extracted at lower sulfuric acid concentration was more susceptible to photooxidation, and less susceptible to bacterial degradation, than DOM extracted at a higher sulfuric acid concentration. Thus the relative importance of these two turnover processes may be altered with changes in acid deposition.

Bacterial production, abundance and cell properties in boreal estuaries: relation to dissolved organic matter quantity and quality	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Estuarine bacteria are key modifiers of allochthonous matter entering the sea, and thereby control major biogeochemical processes such as nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation. In a highly dynamic estuarine environment, bacterial growth and activity are regulated by multiple factors including the availability of organic carbon, inorganic nutrient concentrations, salinity and temperature. The variability of estuarine bacterial communities in relation to environmental factors and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality was studied in three Baltic Sea estuaries with different catchment characteristics, flow and mixing regimes. The work was conducted during six consecutive seasons over 2 years. Bacterial activity, biomass and cytometric cell population characteristics were studied against an suite of environmental parameters and DOM quality and quantity (Salinity, DOC, DON and DIN concentration, SUVA(254), UV Slope(275-295), Fluoresecence peaks A and T, and Apparent mean molecular weight). Environmental variables and DOM quality varied significantly between rivers, indicating influence of catchment characteristics. Bacterial biomass varied significantly between the sampling seasons, and bacterial production also varied between the rivers, indicating an influence of DOM quality on bacterial activity. Based on cytometric grouping into low- and high- nucleic acid bacterial populations (LNA and HNA, respectively) salinity-dependent and salinity-independent clusters of bacterial variables were identified. The results suggest that the LNA clusters were not directly dependent on salinity, but possibly linked to humic substance degradation, whereas the HNA clusters were linked to salinity-correlated environmental variables reflecting DOM quality. Mixed-effects regression modeling of bacterial biomass turnover time suggests DOM fluorescence properties to be useful proxies of bioavailability. Our study shows that growth and community dynamics of estuarine bacteria may be partially regulated by quality of riverine DOM, and cytometric sub-populations of estuarine bacteria have differing regulative factors.

J	Shi, YX; Mangal, V; Gueguen, C				Shi, Yong Xiang; Mangal, Vaughn; Gueguen, Celine			Influence of dissolved organic matter on dissolved vanadium speciation in the Churchill River estuary (Manitoba, Canada)	CHEMOSPHERE												Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) devices were used to investigate the temporal and spatial changes in vanadium (V) speciation in the Churchill estuary system (Manitoba). Thirty-six DGT sets and 95 discrete water samples were collected at 8 river and 3 estuary sites during spring freshet and summer base flow. Dissolved V concentration in the Churchill River at summer base flow was approximately 5 times higher than those during the spring high flow (27.3 +/- 18.9 nM vs 4.8 +/- 3.5 nM). DGT-labile V showed an opposite trend with greater values found during the spring high flow (2.6 +/- 1.8 nM vs 1.4 +/- 03 nM). Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) conducted on 95 excitation-emission matrix spectra validated four humic-like (C1-C4) and one protein-like (C5) fluorescent components. Significant positive relationship was found between protein-like DOM and DGT-labile V (r = 0.53, p < 0.05), indicating that protein-like DOM possibly affected the DGT-labile V concentration in Churchill River. Sediment leachates were enriched in DGT-labile V and protein-like DOM, which can be readily released when river sediment began to thaw during spring freshet. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) decreased (OH)-O-center dot generation by TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3, with FA inhibiting (OH)-O-center dot generation more than HA. The generated (OH)-O-center dot in NPs/DOM mixtures was higher than the measured concentrations because DOM consumes (OH)-O-center dot faster than its molecular probe. None of NPs/FA mixtures produced O-2(center dot-). The generated O-2(center dot-) concentrations in NPs/HA mixtures (except Fe2O3/HA) were higher than the sum of O-2(center dot-) concentrations that produced as NPs and HA were presented by themselves. Synergistic O-2(center dot-) generation in NPs/HA mixtures resulted from O-2 reduction by electron transferred from photoionized HA to NPs. DOM increased O-1(2) generation by TiO2, CuO, CeO2, and SiO2, and FA promoted O-1(2) generation more than HA. Enhanced O-1(2) generation resulted from DOM sensitization of NPs. HA did not increase O-1(2) generation by ZnO and Fe2O3 primarily because released ions quenched O-1(2) precursor ((3)HA*). Linear correlation was developed between total ROS concentrations generated by NPs/DOM mixtures and bacterial survival rates (R-2 >= 0.80). The results implied the necessity of considering DOM when investigating the photoreactivity of NPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rossel, PE; Bienhold, C; Boetius, A; Dittmar, T				Rossel, Pamela E.; Bienhold, Christina; Boetius, Antje; Dittmar, Thorsten			Dissolved organic matter in pore water of Arctic Ocean sediments: Environmental influence on molecular composition	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Marine organic matter (OM) sinks from surface water to the seafloor via the biological pump. Benthic communities, which use this sedimented OM as an energy and carbon source, produce dissolved OM (DOM) in the process of degradation, enriching the sediment pore water with fresh DOM compounds. In the oligotrophic deep Arctic basin, particle flux is low but highly seasonal. We hypothesized that the molecular signal of freshly deposited, primary produced OM would be detectable in surface sediment pore water, which should differ in DOM composition from bottom water and deeper sediment pore water. The study focused on (i) the molecular composition of the DOM in sediment pore water of the deep Eurasian Arctic basins, (ii) the signal of marine vs. terrigenous DOM represented by different compounds preserved in the pore water and (iii) the relationship between Arctic Ocean ice cover and DOM composition. Composition based on mass spectrometric information, obtained via 15 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, was correlated with environmental parameters with partial least square analysis. The fresh marine detrital OM signal from surface water was limited to pore water from <5 cm sediment depth. The productive ice margin stations showed a higher abundance of peptide, unsaturated aliphatic and saturated fatty acid molecular formulae, indicative of recent phytodetritus deposition, than the multiyear ice-covered stations, which had a stronger aromatic signal. The study contributes to the understanding of the coupling between Arctic Ocean productivity and its depositional regime, and how it may be altered in response to sea ice retreat and increasing river runoff.

J	Chon, K; Cho, J				Chon, Kangmin; Cho, Jaeweon			Fouling behavior of dissolved organic matter in nanofiltration membranes from a pilot-scale drinking water treatment plant: An autopsy study	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												This study investigated the fouling behavior and mechanisms of nariofiltration (NF) membranes fed with surface water pre-treated using a combined coagulation and microfiltration (CC-MF) process in a pilot scale drinking water treatment plant through membrane autopsies and characterization of the desorbed foulants. The CC-MF process removed hydrophobic DOM components preferentially and mitigated biofouling of the NF membranes efficiently. This clearly shows that the fouling characteristics of the NF membranes can be influenced by the CC-MF process. The fouling formation of the NF membranes was dominated by chemically removable DOM components primarily consisting of hydrophilic fractions and inorganic scaling. However, the surfaces of the fouled NF membrane (contact angle = 65) were more hydrophobic than those of the virgin NF membrane (contact angle = 57). This is attributed to the differences in the fouling behavior of hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOM components in relation to the surface features of the NF membranes (i.e., surface zeta potential and contact angle). The initial formation of organic fouling layers on the NF membranes surfaces was caused by deposition of hydrophilic DOM components, which can decrease electrostatic repulsive forces between humic substances and the negatively charged NF membrane surfaces by reducing the negative surface zeta potential. Therefore, hydrophobic DOM components accumulated more readily onto the NF membrane surfaces. The covering hydrophilic organic fouling layers with hydrophobic fractions may intensify the subsequent adsorption of hydrophobic DOM components on the NF membrane surfaces by increasing the contact angle.

Effects of filamentous bulking on the characteristics and trihalomethane (THM) formation reactivity of MBR effluent dissolved organic matter (EfOM) were investigated. Filamentous sludge bulking had no significant influence on the regulated MBR effluent water quality except NO2-N and NO3-N. NS-MBR effluent had more low molecular weight (LMW) (<5 kDa) EfOM (92.43%) than BS-MBR (75.18%). About two-thirds of EfOM from BS-MBR were hydrophilic substances. On the contrary, EfOM from NS-MBR exhibited higher hydrophobicity. The ratio of polysaccharides and proteins in MBR effluents increased after filamentous bulking. There were more protein-like materials, fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like in BS-MBR EfOM. The THM formation reactivity of BS-MBR EfOM was 30.15% of NS-MBR EfOM, whereas BS-MBR EfOM exhibited higher formation reactivity of bromine containing species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its importance, a full assessment of Cys abiotic transformation kinetics, products and pathways under environmental conditions has not been conducted. This study is a mechanistic evaluation of the photochemical and nonphotochemical (dark) transformations of Cys in solutions containing chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The results show that Cys underwent abiotic transformations under both dark and irradiated conditions. Under dark conditions, the transformation rates of Cys were moderate and were highly pH- and temperature-dependent. Under UVA or natural sunlight irradiations, Cys transformation rates were enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to rates under dark conditions. Product analysis indicated cystine and cysteine sulfmic acid were the major photooxidation products. In addition, this study provides an assessment of the contributions of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and triplet dissolved organic matter to the CDOM-sensitized photochemical oxidation of Cys. The results suggest that another unknown pathway was dominant in the CDOM-sensitized photo degradation of Cys, which will require further study to identify.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 21	2016	50	12					6363	6373		10.1021/acs.est.6b01291						WOS:000378469900030	27172378	
J	Walpen, N; Schroth, MH; Sander, M				Walpen, Nicolas; Schroth, Martin H.; Sander, Michael			Quantification of Phenolic Antioxidant Moieties in Dissolved Organic Matter by Flow-Injection Analysis with Electrochemical Detection	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Phenolic moieties in dissolved organic matter (DOM) play important roles as antioxidants in oxidation processes in natural and engineered systems. This work presents an automated and highly sensitive flow injection analysis (FIA) system coupled to both spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection to quantify electron-donating phenolic moieties in DOM by determining the number of electrons that these moieties transfer to an added chemical oxidant, the radical cation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(center dot+)). The FIA system was successfully validated using Trolox as a redox standard. Highest method sensitivity was attained when combining the FIA with chronoamperometric detection, resulting in limits of quantification of picomolar amounts of Trolox and nanogram amounts of DOM (corresponding to solutions with <1 mg carbon per liter). The analysis of DOM isolates showed a strong linear correlation between the number of electrons donated and their titrated phenol contents, supporting oxidation of phenols by ABTS(center dot+). The broad application spectrum of the FIA system to dilute natural DOM samples was illustrated by analyzing water samples collected from northern peatlands and by monitoring the oxidation of phenols in one peat sample upon incubation with a phenol oxidase. The superior analytical capability of the FIA system allows quantifying phenols and monitoring phenol dynamics in dilute DOM samples.

In the present study, a hybrid model is presented along with empirical methods to remotely determine the amount and type of CDOM in coastal and inland water environments. A large set of in-situ data collected on several oceanographic cruises and field campaigns from different regional waters was used to develop empirical methods for studying the distribution and dynamics of CDOM, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and salinity. Our validation analyses demonstrated that the hybrid model is a better descriptor of CDOM absorption spectra compared to the existing models. Additional spectral slope parameters included in the present model to differentiate between terrestrially derived and marine CDOM pools make a substantial improvement over those existing models. Empirical algorithms to derive CDOM, DOC and salinity from remote sensing reflectance data demonstrated success in retrieval of these products with significantly low mean relative percent differences from large in-situ measurements. The performance of these algorithms was further assessed using three hyperspectral HICO images acquired simultaneously with our field measurements in productive coastal and lagoon waters on the southeast part of India. The validation match-ups of CDOM and salinity showed good agreement between HICO retrievals and field observations. Further analyses of these data showed significant temporal changes in CDOM and phytoplankton absorption coefficients with a distinct phase shift between these two products. Healthy phytoplanlcton cells and macrophytes were recognized to directly contribute to the autochthonous production of colored humic-like substances in variable amounts within the lagoon system, despite CDOM content being partly derived through river run-off and wetland discharges as well as from conservative mixing of different water masses. Spatial and temporal maps of CDOM, DOC and salinity products provided an interesting insight into these CDOM dynamics and conservative behavior within the lagoon and its extension in coastal and offshore waters of the Bay of Bengal. The hybrid model and empirical algorithms presented here can be useful to assess CDOM, DOC and salinity fields and their changes in response to increasing runoff of nutrient pollution, anthropogenic activities, hydrographic variations and climate oscillations.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from dead plant material and surface soil leaches into water bodies when snow melts. In our study, water samples from nine sampling sites along the Heilongjiang watershed were collected in February and June 2014 during which period snowmelt occurred. The goal of this study was to characterize changes in DOM and bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) associated with snowmelt, the effects of DOM, environmental and geographical factors on the distribution of BCC and interactions of aquatic bacterioplankton populations with different sources of DOM in the Heilongjiang watershed. BCC was measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DOM was measured by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Bacterioplankton exhibited a distinct seasonal change in community composition due to snowmelt at all sampling points except for EG. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that BCC was more closely related to DOM (Components 1 and 4, dissolved organic carbon, biochemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll a) and environmental factors (water temperature and nitrate nitrogen) than geographical factors. Furthermore, DOM had a greater impact on BCC than environmental factors (29.80 vs. 15.90% of the variation). Overall, spring snowmelt played an important role in altering the quality and quantity of DOM and BCC in the Heilongjiang watershed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To date, research has been focused almost exclusively on the contaminants, but detailed insights of the interaction of contaminant biodegradation, dominant redox processes, and interactions with natural DOM are missing. This study linked on-site high resolution spatial sampling of groundwater with high resolution molecular characterization of DOM and its relation to groundwater geochemistry across a petroleum hydrocarbon plume cross-section. Electrospray- and atmospheric pressure photoionization (ESI, APPI) ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) revealed a strong interaction between DOM and reactive sulfur species linked to microbial sulfate reduction, i.e., the key redox process involved in contaminant biodegradation. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) modeling attributed DOM samples to specific contamination traits. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy evaluated the aromatic compounds and their degradation products in samples influenced by the petroleum contamination and its biodegradation. Our orthogonal high resolution analytical approach enabled a comprehensive molecular level understanding of the DOM with respect to in situ petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation and microbial sulfate reduction. The role of natural DOM as potential cosubstrate and detoxification reactant may improve future bioremediation strategies.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER PRESENT IN THE WATER OF THE BIO-BIO RIVER, VIII REGION OF CHILE. CARACTERIZACION DE LA MATERIA ORGANICA DISUELTA PRESENTE EN LAS AGUAS DEL RIO BIO BIO, VIII REGION DE CHILE	JOURNAL OF THE CHILEAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The dissolved organic matter in rivers has different origin and its composition can vary both by natural conditions and the anthropic activity that takes place near rivers. This mobile fraction of the organic matter is composed of sub-fractions of different molecular weight and polarity, which confer different complexing capacity for the pollutants and thus a different impact on the environment. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the organic matter dissolved in a representative basin of a temperate zone in South America, such as Bio Bio River located in the VIII region of Chile. The material was characterized chemically and spectroscopically after fractionating by molecular weight and polarity. It is concluded that the dissolved organic matter of the Rucalhue sector has a terrestrial origin, with a high aromatic carbon content, in contrast with that from Laja and Concepcion, which has a greater anthropic impact. The dissolved organic matters from the sectors with high anthropic activity have larger molecular size and higher organic carbon content and conductivity.																	0717-9707					JUN	2016	61	2					2890	2894								WOS:000389063200008

Dissolved organic matter transport reflects hillslope to stream connectivity during snowmelt in a montane catchment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport is a key biogeochemical linkage across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in headwater catchments, and quantifying the biological and hydrological controls on DOM composition provides insight into DOM cycling at the catchment scale. We evaluated the mobility of DOM components during snowmelt in a montane, semiarid catchment. DOM composition was evaluated on a near-daily basis within the soil and the stream during snowmelt, and was compared to groundwater samples using a site-specific parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model derived from soil extracts. The fluorescent component loadings in the interstitial soil water and in the groundwater were significantly different and did not temporally change during snowmelt. In the stream, a transition occurred during snowmelt from fluorescent DOM with higher contributions of amino acid-like components indicative of groundwater to higher humic-like contributions indicative of soil water. Furthermore, we identified a humic-like fluorescent component in the soil water and the stream that is typically only observed in extracted water soluble organic matter from soil which may suggest hillslope to stream connectivity over very short time scales. Qualitative interpretations of changes in stream fluorescent DOM were supported by two end-member mixing analyses of conservative tracers. After normalizing fluorescent DOM loadings for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, we found that the peak in DOC concentration in the stream was driven by the nonfluorescent fraction of DOM. This study demonstrated how PARAFAC analysis can be used to refine our conceptual models of runoff generation sources, as well as provide a more detailed understanding of stream chemistry dynamics.																	0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2016	52	6					4905	4923		10.1002/2015WR017878						WOS:000380100200037

We measured biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) via incubation assays and DOM composition using optical indices on 11 dates in three Lake Superior tributaries. Percent BDOC (%BDOC) and BDOC concentrations were seasonally synchronous across these watersheds, despite that they vary in size by orders of magnitude (1.7 to 3400km(2)). Relative to %BDOC, BDOC concentrations were more tightly constrained among sites on any given date. BDOC also varied within seasons; for example, %BDOC on two different dates in winter were among the highest (29% and 54%) and lowest (0%) values observed for each site (overall %BDOC range: 0 to 72%). DOM composition varied the most among tributaries during a summer storm event when BDOC (both as percent and concentration) was elevated but was remarkably similar among tributaries during fall, spring, and winter. Multivariate models identified humic-like and tryptophan-like fluorophores as predictors of %BDOC, but DOM composition only described 21% of the overall variation in %BDOC. Collectively, these three rivers exported similar to 18GgCyr(-1) as DOC and similar to 2GgCyr(-1) as BDOC, which corresponded to 9 to 17% of annual DOC exported in biodegradable form. Our results suggest much of the C exported from these northern temperate watersheds may be biodegradable within 28days and that large pulses of labile DOM can be exported during storm events and spring snowmelt.

High-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled with a multiple wavelength detector (200-280 nm) was employed to characterise DOM by molecular weight distribution, bacterial activity was analysed using flow cytometry, and a package of simple analytical tools, such as dissolved organic carbon, absorbance at 254 nm, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and total disinfectant residual were also applied and their applicability to indicate water quality changes in distribution systems were also evaluated. Results showed that multi-wavelength HPSEC analysis was useful to provide information about DOM character while changes in molecule weight profiles at wavelengths less than 230 nm were also able to be related to other water quality parameters. Correct selection of the UV wavelengths can be an important factor for providing appropriate indicators associated with different DOM compositions. DOM molecular weight in the range of 0.2-0.5 kDa measured at 210 nm correlated positively with oxidised nitrogen concentration (r = 0.99), and the concentrations of active bacterial cells in the distribution system (r = 0.85). Our study also showed that the changes of DOM character and bacterial cells were significant in those sampling points that had decreases in total disinfectant residual. HPSEC-UV measured at 210 nm and flow cytometry can detect the changes of low molecular weight of DOM and bacterial levels, respectively, when nitrification occurred within the chloraminated distribution system.

J	Engel, M; Chefetz, B				Engel, Maya; Chefetz, Benny			Adsorption and desorption of dissolved organic matter by carbon nanotubes: Effects of solution chemistry	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Increasing use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has led to their introduction into the environment where they can interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM). This study focuses on solution chemistry effects on DOM adsorption/desorption processes by single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Our data show that DOM adsorption is controlled by the attachment of DOM molecules to the SWCNTs, and that the initial adsorption rate is dependent on solution parameters. Adsorbed amount of DOM at high ionic strength was limited, possibly due to alterations in SWCNT bundling. Desorption of DOM performed at low pH resulted in additional DOM adsorption, whereas at high pH, adsorbed DOM amount decreased. The extent of desorption conducted at increased ionic strength was dependent on pre-adsorbed DOM concentration: low DOM loading stimulated additional adsorption of DOM, whereas high DOM loading facilitated release of adsorbed DOM. Elevated ionic strength and increased adsorbed amount of DOM reduced the oxidation temperature of the SWCNTs, suggesting that changes in the assembly of the SWCNTs had occurred. Moreover, DOM-coated SWCNTs at increased ionic strength provided fewer sites for atrazine adsorption. This study enhances our understanding of DOM SWCNT interactions in aqueous systems influenced by rapid changes in salinity, and facilitates potential use of SWCNTs in water purification technologies.

Influence of dissolved organic matter and manganese oxides on metal speciation in soil solution: A modelling approach	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Trace element (TE) speciation modelling in soil solution is controlled by the assumptions made about the soil solution composition. To evaluate this influence, different assumptions using Visual MINTEQ were tested and compared to measurements of free TE concentrations. The soil column Donnan membrane technique (SC-DMT) was used to estimate the free TB (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) concentrations in six acidic soil solutions. A batch technique using DAX-8 resin was used to fractionate the dissolved organic matter (DOM) into four fractions: humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), hydrophilic acids (Hy) and hydrophobic neutral organic matter (HON). To model TE speciation, particular attention was focused on the hydrous manganese oxides (HMO) and the Hy fraction, ligands not considered in most of the TE speciation modelling studies in soil solution. In this work, the model predictions of free ion activities agree with the experimental results. The knowledge of the FA fraction seems to be very useful, especially in the case of high DOM content, for more accurately representing experimental data. Finally, the role of the manganese oxides and of the Hy fraction on TE speciation was identified and, depending on the physicochemical conditions of the soil solution, should be considered in future studies.

The results showed that vermicomposting led to higher pH, TC, and available P but lower EC, TN, available N, and available K in the substrate residues compared with natural composting; the total or available Cu/Zn content in the substrate residues similarly increased after composting or vermicomposting, but Cu was easily enriched in earthworm bodies and its intestinal vermicompost while vermicomposting enhanced the formation of dissolved Zn in DOM; moreover, much more fulvic and humic acid-like materials and much greater aromaticity were exhibited in DOM obtained from vermicomposting residues compared with DOM from composting residues, which may contribute to the variations of Cu/Zn enrichment in earthworms and its migration to the vermicomposting residues or its DOM.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2016	23	12					12128	12139		10.1007/s11356-016-6364-3						WOS:000377476700065	26971511

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected from influent and effluent samples from the constructed wetland was investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy combined with fluorescence regional integration (FRI), parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS). This study evaluates the capability of these methods in detecting the spectral characteristics of fluorescent DOM fractions and their changes in constructed wetlands. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with FRI analysis showed that protein-like materials displayed a higher removal ratio compared to humic-like substances. The PARAFAC analysis of wastewater DOM indicated that six fluorescent components, i.e., two protein-like substances (C1 and C6), three humic-like substances (C2, C3 and C5), and one non-humic component (C4), could be identified. Tryptophan-like C1 was the dominant component in the influent DOM. The removal ratios of six fluorescent components (C1-C6) were 56.21, 32.05, 49.19, 39.90, 29.60, and 45.87 %, respectively, after the constructed wetland treatment. Furthermore, 2D-COS demonstrated that the sequencing of spectral changes for fluorescent DOM followed the order 298 nm -> 403 nm -> 283 nm (310-360 nm) in the constructed wetland, suggesting that the peak at 298 nm is associated with preferential tryptophan fluorescence removal. Variation of the fluorescence index (FI) and the ratio of fluorescence components indicated that the constructed wetland treatment resulted in the decrease of fluorescent organic pollutant with increasing the humification and chemical stability of the DOM.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2016	23	12					12237	12245		10.1007/s11356-016-6435-5						WOS:000377476700075	26976008

We conducted a field survey of DOM ultraviolet (UV) absorption and fluorescence in a large lake (Lake Biwa, Japan). We used an integrated analysis of their spectra, including their derivatives and apparent quantum yield. From this analysis we were able to identify the different DOM sources. Variations of dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the epilimnion were correlated with the first derivative of UV absorption at 285 nm and a protein-like peak in the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM). Both fingerprints were derived from living organisms. Although the variations of UV absorption over 300 nm and a humic-like peak in EEM in the lake water were affected by multiple sources and reactions, several complementary methods, including field studies and laboratory experiments, led to the conclusion that chromophoric DOM in the hypolimnion was intensively affected by microbial alteration. Our results indicate that an integrated analysis of UV absorption and fluorescence can improve the utility of DOM characterization in lake environments.

The leaves were exposed in the field for up to one year before leaching. The DOM leached from slash pine litter contained on average 10.4 mg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) per gram of dry weight; for S. superba the average was 37.2 mg-DOC/g-dry weight. Ultraviolet and visible light absorbance, fluorescence, and molecular weight analysis indicated that more aromatic/humic and higher molecular weight compounds are formed as leaf litter ages. A 4-component parallel factor analysis of the fluorescence data showed that the intensity of peaks related with protein-like components decreased gradually during biodegradation, while that of peaks attributed to humic-acid-like components increased continuously. Fresh slash pine leachates formed on average 40.0 mu g of trihalomethane (THM) per milligram of DOC, while S. superba leachates formed 45.6 mu g. THM formation showed peak values of 55.7 mu g/mg DOC for slash pine and 74.9 mu g/mg DOC for S. superba after 8 months of aging. The formation of haloacetonitrile (HAN) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) increased with increasing leaf age, while chloral hydrate (CH) formation did not show such a trend. Specific UV absorbance showed some positive correlation with DBPs, but humic-acid-like and protein-like absorbance peaks correlated with CH and TCNM yields in only some leaf samples.

The feasibility of biochar applications is depended on its physical and chemical properties and biochar-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics. This study was conducted to investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of biochar-derived DOM and its binding capacity of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs). DOM solutions were isolated from five different biochars prepared through pyrolysis and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents. The optical analysis with UV-visible absorption and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopes and DOC water distribution coefficient (K-DOC) were calculated in the presence of PAHs and DOM. The DOC contents and the estimated aromaticity (SUVA(254)) were different for selected biochars. The DOM derived from soybean straw biochar (SBBC) showed the highest DOC contents followed by rice straw biochar (RSBC). The SBBC and RSBC peak position in the fluorescence excitation/emission matrix at longer wavelength corresponded to the peak position of other three biochars indicating that SBBC and RSBC had relatively higher degree of humification. This was well correlated with the observed K-DOC values, suggesting that the K-DOC values dominant factor was the degree of biochar-derived DOM humification. The results of this study indicate that the optical analysis may provide valuable information regarding the characteristics of biochar-derived DOM and its application as environmental amendments for minimization of toxic organic compounds.

Three fluorescent groups were identified, including two protein-like (tryptophan-like C1 and tyrosine-like C2) and one microbial humic-like components (C3). In bEPS, protein-like components were consistently more dominant than C3 during the MBR operation, while their relative abundance in SMP depended on aeration intensities. C1 of bEPS exhibited a linear correlation (R-2 = 0.738; p < 0.01) with bEPS amounts in sludge, and C2 was closely related to the stability of sludge. The protein-like components were more greatly responsible for membrane fouling. Our study suggests that EEM-PARAFAC can be a promising monitoring tool to provide further insight into process evaluation and membrane fouling during MBR operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

They are composed of different mesoscale ecohydrological subunits, whose individual contributions to the water and carbon export of mire catchments are not well understood. The spring snowmelt period is the major hydrological event in the annual water cycle of the boreal regions and strongly influences the carbon flux between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. The aim of this study was (1) to provide a conceptual understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the surface water chemistry along a swamp forest-fen-bog gradient during the snowmelt period, (2) to quantify the exported dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the runoff and (3) to identify the ecohydrological landscape unit that contributes most to DOC export during the snowmelt period in a heterogeneous mire complex in Northwest Russia. The highest DOC concentrations were detected in the swamp forest, and the lowest concentrations were observed at the treeless bog by the end of the snowmelt period (swamp forest: 37-43 mg l(-1), bog: 13-17 mg l(-1)). During the spring snowmelt period, a significant amount (similar to 1.7 g Cm-2) of DOC was transferred by the similar to 74 mm of runoff from the catchment into the river. Variability in the thawing periods led to differences in the relative contributions of each ecohydrological zone to the carbon export measured at a stream channel draining the studied part of the mire complex. An increased understanding of the variation in DOC concentrations and contributions from the mesoscale ecohydrological subunits to carbon export can help to predict the potential regional loss of DOC based on land cover type under climate change.

J	Chen, Y; Yang, GP; Xia, QY; Wu, GW				Chen, Yan; Yang, Gui-Peng; Xia, Qing-Yan; Wu, Guan-Wei			Enrichment and characterization of dissolved organic matter in the surface microlayer and subsurface water of the South Yellow Sea	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved carbohydrates (TDCHO, including monosaccharides, MCHO and polysaccharides, PCHO), total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA, including dissolved free, DFAA and combined fraction, DCAA),and chlorophyll a were measured in the surface microlayer (SML) and subsurface water (SSW) of the South Yellow Sea (SYS) in May 2010. The concentrations of DOC, TDCHO, THAA and chlorophyll a in the SML were respectively correlated with their SSW concentrations, implying that transport from the SSW could be a major source of substances in the SML. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that concentrations of DOC, MCHO and DCAA were significantly higher in the SML than in the SSW. Major constituents of DCAA and DFAA present in the study area were glycine, serine, alanine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid. The enrichment factor (EF) of a compound is defined as the ratio of the concentration in the SML to that in the corresponding SSW. Carbohydrate species and amino acids were generally enriched in the SML, with mean EF values significantly greater than unity (t-test, P < 0.05). The TDCHO concentrations were positively correlated to the chlorophyll a concentrations in the SML, suggesting that in situ production from phytoplankton might be another important source for the microlayer TDCHO. Our data showed that no significant correlations were found between the EFs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and environmental parameters (e.g., wind speed, water depth, salinity, water temperature and distance from shore). TDCHO comprised on average 15.21% of DOC in the SML and 11.31% of DOC in the SSW, while THAA accounted for 9.03% of DOC in the SML and 7.76% of DOC in the SSW. The yields of TDCHO and THAA were consistently higher in the SML than in the SSW, whereas degradation index (DI) values in the SML were similar to those in the SSW. High yields of TDCHO and THAA in the SML probably suggested that samples in the SML were fresher than those in the SSW. The present study may have implications for the source, enrichment and bioavailability of DOM in the SML. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An EEMs PARAFAC modeling of samples collected within 16 km of the wellhead during the oil spill in May 2010, which included one typical subsurface sample with a PAH concentration of 1.09 mu g/L, identified two humic-like and two previously reported oil-like components. Compared to prespill levels, however, there were order-of-magnitude higher fluorescence intensities associated with these components that are consistent with an oil-spill source. The spectral decomposition of the EEMs data using individual and combined data sets from coastal and offshore waters impacted by the DwH spill further revealed the changing nature of fluorescent DOM composition. Although the PAHs concentrations were at prespill conditions after the spill in 2012 and 2013 near the DwH site, the variable and anomalous levels of fluorescence intensities and DOC concentrations three years after the spill suggest the potential long-term persistence of the oil in the DOC pool in the NGoM.

Linkages between the circulation and distribution of dissolved organic matter in the White Sea, Arctic Ocean	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The White Sea is a semi-enclosed Arctic marginal sea receiving a significant loading of freshwater (225-231 km(3) yr(-1) equaling an annual runoff yield of 2.5 m) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from river run-off. We report discharge weighed values of stable oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of -14.0 parts per thousand in Northern Dvina river for the period 10 May-12 October 2012. We found a significant linear relationship between salinity (S) and delta O-18 (delta O-18 = -17.66 +/- 0.58+0.52 +/- 0.02 x S; R-2=0.96, N=162), which indicates a dominant contribution of river water to the freshwater budget and little influence of sea ice formation or melt. No apparent brine additions from sea-ice formation is evident in the White Sea deep waters as seen from a joint analysis of temperature (T), S, delta O-18 and a(CDOM)(350) data, confirming previous suggestions about strong tidal induced vertical mixing in winter being the likely source of the deep waters. We investigated properties and distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the White Sea basin and coastal areas in summer. We found contrasting DOM properties in the inflowing Barents Sea waters and White Sea waters influenced by terrestrial runoff. Values of absorption by CDOM at 350 nm (a(CDOM)(350)) and DOC (exceeding 10 m(-1) and 550 mu mol l(-1), respectively) in surface waters of the White Sea basin are higher compared to other river-influenced coastal Arctic domains. Linear relationship between S and CDOM absorption, and S and DOC (DOC=959.21 +/- 52.99-25.80 +/- 1.79 x S; R-2=0.85; N=154) concentrations suggests conservative mixing of DOM in the White Sea. The strongest linear correlation between CDOM absorption and DOC was found in the ultraviolet (DOC=56.31 +/- 2.76+9.13 +/- 0.15 x a(CDOM)(254); R-2=0.99; N=155), which provides an easy and robust tool to trace DOC using CDOM absorption measurements as well as remote sensing algorithms. Deviations from this linear relationship in surface waters likely indicate contribution from different rivers along the coast of the White Sea. Characteristics of CDOM further indicate that there is limited removal or change in the DOM pool before it exits to the Barents Sea. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Analyses were performed on two major DOM fractions, the hydrophobic organic acid (HPOA) and transphilic organic acid (TPIA) fractions obtained using XAD resins. Together these two fractions comprised 64-74% of the total DOM. Carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) accounted for the majority of carbon atoms in the HPOA (63-77%) and TPIA (54-78%) samples, and more so in winter and summer than in spring samples. 2D and selective NMR data revealed association of abundant nonprotonated O-alkyl and quaternary alkyl C (OCnp, OCnpO and C-q, 13-17% of HPOA and 15-20% of TPIA) and isolated O-CH structures with CRAM, which were not recognized in previous studies. Spectral editing and 2D NMR allowed for the discrimination of carbohydrate-like O-alkyl C from non-carbohydrate O-alkyl C. Whereas two spring freshet TPIA samples contained carbohydrate clusters such as carboxylated carbohydrates (16% and 26%), TPIA samples from other seasons or HPOA samples mostly had small amounts (<8%) of sugar rings dispersed in a nonpolar alkyl environment. Though nonprotonated aromatic C represented the largest fraction of aromatic C in all HPOA/TPIA isolates, only a small fraction (similar to 5% in HPOA and 3% in TPIA) was possibly associated with dissolved black carbon. Our results imply a relatively stable portion of DOM exported by the Yukon River across different seasons, due to the predominance of CRAM and their associated nonprotonated C-O and O-C-O structures, and elevated reactivity (bio- and photo-lability) of spring DOM due to the presence of terrestrial inputs enriched in carbohydrates and aromatic structures.

Characterization of water dissolved organic matter under woody vegetation patches in semi-arid Mediterranean soils	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Woody patches in semiarid environments favor the establishment of other plants. Facilitation may be favored by an increase in soil fertility. Dissolved organic matter (DOM), is the most active fraction of soil organic matter and may contain compounds affecting plant establishment, as allelochemicals, hormone -like substances and metal carriers. However, information on DOM contents and composition in these environments is scarce. In this paper, we study the impact of woody patches on DOM in Stipa tenacissirna L steppes and discuss its implications for community dynamics. DOM under patch- and inter -patch areas, was analyzed for elemental composition, UV-Vis indices and organic acid content. Element concentration and composition in DOM, and organic acid concentration were similar in patch- and inter -patch areas. Yet, soils under patches were richer in DOC, aromatic species and organic acids (particularly fumaric acid) than soils in inter -patch areas. Dominant species affected organic matter concentration and quality in complex ways. Thus, patches dominated by Ephedra fragiii.s showed higher concentrations of TOC and aromatics than those dominated by other species. Rhamnus lycioides patches showed the highest accumulation of fumaric acid, which may contribute to its successful recruitment rate and expansion in the area. Our results show substantial differences in the amount and composition of DOM and specific compounds affecting soil functionality and plant dynamics. Further studies on the effects of such changes on seedling performance are needed to increase our understanding of plant plantinteractions in semiarid environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms and governing factors of these emissions are still largely unknown, especially concerning the effect of land use. We compared dissolved and gaseous carbon dynamics in streams bordered by contrasting types of land use, specifically agriculture and forest. Carbon dioxide and methane partial pressures (pCO(2) and pCH(4), respectively) in the water body and carbon emissions via both gases were studied for 24 h during four field expeditions. pCH(4) did not differ between the two system types. pCO(2) was constantly oversaturated in all streams and significantly higher in agricultural streams (annual mean 4282 ppm) compared to forest streams (annual mean 2189 ppm) during all seasons. However, emissions of CO2 were not significantly different between the stream types due to significantly higher gas transfer velocity in forest compared to agricultural streams. pCO(2) was significantly positively correlated to the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus in the water. Furthermore, pCO(2) was correlated to optical parameters of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, e.g., it increased with indicators of molecular size and an allochthonous fluorescent component identified by Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). This study demonstrates that different forms of land use may trigger a cascade of effects on the carbon production and emission of streams linked to changes in DOM quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The character of DOM further influences the formation of disinfection by products when precursor DOM present in drinking water reacts with chlorine during disinfection. Here we report the development of models that describe the formation potential of trihalomethanes (THMFP) dependent on the character of DOM in waters from discrete catchments with specific land-use and soil textures. DOM was characterized based on UV absorbance at 254 nm, apparent molecular weight and relative abundances of protein-like and humic-like compounds. DOM character and Br concentration (up to 0.5 mg/L) were used as variables in models (R-2 > 0.93) of THMFP, which ranged from 19 to 649 mu g/L. Chloroform concentration (12 594 mu g/L.) and relative abundance (27 - 99%) were first modeled (R-2 > 0.85) and from these, the abundances of bromodichloromethane and chlorodibromomethane estimated using power and exponential functions, respectively (R-2 > 0.98). From these, the abundance of bromoform is calculated. The proposed model may be used in risk assessment of catchment factors on formation of trihalomethanes in drinking water, in context of treatment efficiency for removal of organic matter.

A novel molecular approach for tracing terrigenous dissolved organic matter into the deep ocean	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains one of the largest exchangeable organic carbon pools on Earth. Riverine input represents an important source of DOM to the oceans, yet much remains to be learned about the fate of the DOM linking terrestrial to oceanic carbon cycles through rivers at the global scale. Here we use ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to identify 184 molecular formulae that are indicators of riverine inputs (referred to as t-Peaks) and to track their distribution in the deep North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. The t-Peaks were found to be enriched in the Amazon River, to be highly correlated with known tracers of terrigenous input, and to be observed in all samples from four different rivers characterized by vastly different landscapes and vegetation coverage spanning equatorial (Amazon and Congo), subtropical (Altamaha), and Arctic (Kolyma) regions. Their distribution reveals that terrigenous organic matter is injected into the deep ocean by the global meridional overturning circulation, indicating that a fraction of the terrigenous DOM introduced by rivers contributes to the DOM pool observed in the deep ocean and to the storage of terrigenous organic carbon. This novel molecular approach can be used to further constrain the transfer of DOM from land to sea, especially considering that Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer analysis is becoming increasingly frequent in studies characterizing the molecular composition of DOM in lakes, rivers, and the ocean.

Seawater with DOM from the sources was first either kept in the dark or exposed to sunlight (4 days), after which a bacterial inoculum was added and incubated for 4 additional days. Sunlight exposure reduced the coloured DOM and carbon signals, which was followed by a production of inorganic nutrients. Bacterial carbon cycling was higher in the dark compared with the light treatment in seawater and river samples, while higher levels were found in the sunlight-exposed eelgrass experiment. Sunlight pre-exposure stimulated the bacterial growth efficiency in the seawater experiments, while no impact was found in the other experiments. We suggest that these responses are connected to differences in substrate composition and the production of free radicals. The bacterial community that developed in the dark and sunlight pre-treated samples differed in the seawater and river experiments. Our findings suggest that impact of sunlight exposure on the bacterial carbon transfer and diversity depends on the DOM source and on the sunlight-induced production of inorganic nutrients.

Solar light serves as an important function in degrading pollutants during storage, and its effect on dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated in this study. Solar light significantly decreased the UV254 absorbance and fluorescence (FLU) intensity of reclaimed water. However, its effect on the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) value of reclaimed water was very limited. The decrease in the UV254 absorbance intensity and FLU excitation-emission matrix regional integration volume (FLU volume) of reclaimed water during solar light irradiation was fit with pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. The decrease of UV254 absorbance was much slower than that of the FLU volume. Ultraviolet light in solar light had a key role in decreasing the UV254 absorbance and FLU intensity during solar light irradiation. The light fluence-based removal kinetic constants of the UV254 and FLU intensity were independent of light intensity. The peaks of the UV254 absorbance and FLU intensity with an apparent molecular weight (AMW) of 100 Da to 2000 Da decreased after solar irradiation, whereas the DOC value of the major peaks did not significantly change.

Additionally, it is used as a measure of water quality. To investigate the source and composition of CDOM, we used chemical and fluorescent analyses to characterize CDOM in Heilongjiang. The composition of CDOM can be investigated by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). PARAFAC identified four individual components that were attributed to microbial humic-like (C1) and terrestrial humic-like (C2-4) in water samples collected from the Heilongjiang River. The relationships between the maximum fluorescence intensities of the four PARAFAC components and the water quality parameters indicate that the dynamic of the four components is related to nutrients in the Heilongjiang River. The relationships between the fluorescence component C3 and the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) indicates that component C3 makes a great contribution to BOD5 and it can be used as a carbon source for microbes in the Heilongjiang River. Furthermore, the relationships between component C3, the particulate organic carbon (POC), and the chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) show that component C3 and POC make great contributions to BOD5 and CODMn. The use of these indexes along with PARAFAC results would be of help to characterize the co-variation between the CDOM and water quality parameters in the Heilongjiang River.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2016	23	10					10058	10071		10.1007/s11356-016-6230-3						WOS:000376421400075	26865492

Optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM): Effects of biological and photolytic degradation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Advances in spectroscopic techniques have led to an increase in the use of optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) to assess dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and infer sources and processing. However, little information is available to assess the impact of biological and photolytic processing on the optical properties of original DOM source materials. Over a 3.5 month laboratory study, we measured changes in commonly used optical properties and indices in DOM leached from peat soil, plants, and algae following biological and photochemical degradation to determine whether they provide unique signatures that can be linked to original DOM source. Changes in individual optical parameters varied by source material and process, with biodegradation and photodegradation often causing values to shift in opposite directions. Although values for different source materials frequently overlapped, multivariate statistical analyses showed that unique optical signatures could be linked to original DOM source material, with 17 optical properties determined by discriminant analysis to be significant (p < 0.05) in distinguishing between DOM source and environmental processing. These results demonstrate that inferring source material from optical properties is possible when parameters are evaluated in combination even after extensive biological and photochemical alteration.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2016	61	3					1015	1032		10.1002/lno.10270						WOS:000375748400015

A four-component PARAFAC model was fit to the EEMs, which included two humic- (C1 and C2) and two amino acid-like (C3 and C4) components previously identified in ocean waters. Generalized-additive models (GAMs) were used to explore the environmental factors that drive the global distribution of these PARAFAC components. The explained variance for the humic-like components was substantially larger (> 70%) than for the amino acid-like components (< 35%). The environmental variables exhibiting the largest effect on the global distribution of C1 and C2 were apparent oxygen utilisation followed by chlorophyll a. Positive non-linear relationships between both predictor variables and the two humic-like PARAFAC components suggest that their distribution are biologically controlled. Compared with the dark ocean (> 200 m), the relationships of C1 and C2 with AOU indicate a higher C1/AOU and C2/AOU ratios of the humic-like substances in the dark ocean than in the surface ocean where a net effect of photobleaching is also detected. C3 (tryptophan-like) and C4 (tyrosine-like) variability was mostly dictated by salinity (S), by means of positive non-linear relationships, suggesting a primary physical control of their distributions at the global surface ocean scale that could be related to the changing evaporation-precipitation regime. Remarkably, bacterial biomass (BB) only contributed to explain a minor part of the variability of C1 and C4.

Here, we adopted spectrum fingerprint technologies to explore the related transformation mechanisms of DOM in compost by conducting field investigations in a full-scale housefly larvae composting farm. The 1-week composting with larvae significantly decreased DOM concentrations from 192.9 to 77.1 g kg(-1). The hydrolysis of proteins and lipids were enhanced during composting, as well as a build-up of aromatic substances, while contents of fulvic- and humic-like substances were augmented on Day 5 and Day 6 (ranged from 0.04 to 0.65 and 0.11 to 0.59 for F-max, respectively). Compared with traditional composting without the aid of larvae, the stronger biodegradation of DOM and the subsequent formation of humus in compost, led to a higher level of aromaticity and humification under housefly larvae bioconversion, generating a more stable bio-product for downstream utilisation.																	0734-242X	1096-3669				MAY	2016	34	5					465	473		10.1177/0734242X16636675						WOS:000375837000009	26987735

Assessing the oxidising effect of NaNO3 and NaNO2 from disposed Eurobitum bituminised radioactive waste on the dissolved organic matter in Boom Clay	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												In Belgium, compatibility studies are performed in view of the final disposal of nitrate-containing bituminised intermediate-level radioactive waste in Boom Clay, which is considered as a potential host formation. Due to the presence of large amounts of nitrate in the waste, a slow release of nitrate (and to a smaller extent also nitrite) into the Boom Clay is expected. Nitrate and/or nitrite reduction by redox-active components of the host rock may cause a geochemical perturbation of the clay and subsequently might affect its barrier function against the migration of radionuclides. This paper therefore addresses the possible oxidation of one of the main redox-active components of the Boom Clay, i.e. dissolved organic matter, by nitrate and nitrite. For this, abiotic and microbially mediated nitrate and nitrite reduction was studied during long-term batch tests (2-2.5 years) in Boom Clay pore water, containing 155 +/- 15 mg C/l present as humic and fulvic acids. Changes in the reducing capacity of the DOM due to oxidation were assessed successfully using two oxidants, namely ferricyanide and ferric citrate. The results of these experiments indicate that an abiotic reaction between DOM and nitrate does not occur or is characterised by very slow kinetics. On the other hand, a slow microbial nitrate reduction to nitrite was observed and the associated oxidation of DOM was confirmed by a decrease in the (partial) reducing capacity of DOM for ferric citrate. In contrast to nitrate, nitrite was shown to oxidise DOM both abiotically and mediated by microbes through (chemo) denitrification, although these reactions also seem to occur only at a rather slow rate. No significant change in the maximally obtainable reducing capacity of DOM (using ferricyanide) was detected during any of the observed reactions, suggesting that the impact of such a slow heterotrophic nitrate reduction is very limited.

Ninety-one water samples were collected from the three orders of receiving rivers in a typical combined polluted subcatchment (diffuse agricultural pollutants and domestic sewage) located in China. Then, the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) information for these samples was determined by the excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Consequently, two typical humic-like (C1 and C2) and other two protein-like (C3 and C4) components were separated. Their fluorescence peaks were located at lambda(ex/em) = 255(360)/455, <250(320)/395, 275/335, and <250/305 nm, which resembled the traditional peaks of A + C, A + M, T, and B, respectively. In addition, C1 and C2 accounted for the dominant contributions to FDOM (>60 %). Principal component analysis (PCA) further demonstrated that, except for the autochthonous produced C4, the allochthonous components (C1 and C2) had the same terrestrial origins, but C3 might possess the separate anthropogenic and biological sources. Moreover, the spatial heterogeneity of contamination levels was noticeable in multistage rivers, and the allochthonous FDOM was gradually homogenized along the migration directions. Interestingly, the average content of the first three PARAFAC components in secondary tributaries and source pollutants had significantly higher levels than that in subsequent receiving rivers, thus suggesting that the supervision and remediation for secondary tributaries would play a prominent role in watershed management works.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2016	23	9					8756	8769		10.1007/s11356-016-6110-x						WOS:000375412600059	26805924

The results showed that the bulk DOM and its fractions were comprised of tryosine-, tryptophan-, fulvic-, and humic-like substances. Tyrosine-like matter was dominant in the young leachate DOM and its fractions, while tryptophan-, fulvic-, and humic-like substances were the main components in the intermediate and old leachate DOMs and their fractions. Tryosine-, tryptophan-, fulvic-, and humic-like substances varied concurrently with the hydrophobicity and polarity. However, the change ratio of these substances was different for the three leachates. Tyrosine-like matter, humic-like materials, and fulvic-like substances were the most sensitive to the hydrophobicity and polarity in the young, intermediate, and old leachates, respectively. Such an integrated approach jointly enhances the characterization of the hydrophobicity- and polarity-dependent DOM fractions and provides a promising way to elucidate the environmental behaviors of different DOM species.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2016	23	9					9237	9244		10.1007/s11356-016-6173-8						WOS:000375412600101	26841775

Batch tests were conducted to investigate the influences of rainwater, major wastewater constituents of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and surfactant on the metals leaching from RDS. Results show that the rainwater solutions considerably enhanced the total amounts of Cu (319 +/- 46% of the total leaching amount by blank solutions) and Zn (617 +/- 130%) released from RDS compared with blank solutions. DOM enhanced the leaching of Cu from RDS at a neutral pH. By contrast, DOM had an adverse effect on the mobilization of Zn. In the absence of DOM, a higher concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) slightly increased the release of Cu from RDS than a lower concentration of SDS. However, the existence of SDS suppressed the release of Zn from RDS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, HY; Du, Y; Wu, QY; Zhao, X; Tang, X; Chen, Z				Hu, Hong-Ying; Du, Ye; Wu, Qian-Yuan; Zhao, Xin; Tang, Xin; Chen, Zhuo			Differences in dissolved organic matter between reclaimed water source and drinking water source	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) significantly affects the quality of reclaimed water and drinking water. Reclaimed water potable reuse is an effective way to augment drinking water source and de facto reuse exists worldwide. Hence, when reclaimed water source (namely secondary effluent) is blended with drinking water source, understanding the difference in DOM between drinking water source (dDOM) and reclaimed water source (rDOM) is essential. In this study, composition, transformation, and potential risk of dDOM from drinking water source and rDOM from secondary effluent were compared. Generally, the DOC concentration of rDOM and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content in reclaimed water source were higher but rDOM exhibited a lower aromaticity. Besides, rDOM comprises a higher proportion of hydrophilic fractions and more low-molecular weight compounds, which are difficult to be removed during coagulation. Although dDOM exhibited higher specific disinfection byproducts formation potential (SDBPFP), rDOM formed more total disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during chlorination including halomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) due to high DOC concentration. Likewise, in consideration of DOC basis, rDOM contained more absolute assimilable organic carbon (AOC) despite showing a lower specific AOC (normalized AOC per unit of DOC). Besides, rDOM exhibited higher biotoxicity including genotoxicity and endocrine disruption. Therefore, rDOM presents a greater potential risk than dDOM does. Reclaimed water source needs to be treated carefully when it is blended with drinking water source.

The differences in their binding capacities for individual fluorescent components with As/Sb were studied using fluorescence-quenching titrations combined with excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra. The results indicated that the particle size influenced the quality and quantity of extracted DOM. With increasing particle size, the extracted DOM content, value of UV280 and acidic functional group content of the DOM decreased. Three protein-like components (C2, C3 and C4) and one humic-like component (C1) were identified using the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model. Wherein, protein-like material dominated in DOM on different particle-size fractions and possessed a stronger complex capacity with As/Sb. A significant positive correlation between the complexation capacity of extracted DOM from samples, as well as with the acidic functional group content, was observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yan, MQ; Ma, J; Ji, GD				Yan, Mingquan; Ma, Jing; Ji, Guodong			Examination of effects of Cu(II) and Cr(III) on Al(III) binding by dissolved organic matter using absorbance spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												Effects of Cu(II) and Cr(III) ions on the binding of Al(III) onto Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) exemplified by Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) at pH 6.0 were quantified in this study using linear and log transformed SRHA absorbance spectra acquired at varying Al3+ concentrations and Cu2+ or Cr3+ levels. The competition between Al3+ and Cu2+/Cr3+ for the binding sites in DOM was ascertained by examining the intensity and shapes of the metal-specific differential spectra of DOM. The results indicated that the binding of Al3+ onto SRHA is little influenced in the cases of in presence of 1.0 and 10.0 mu M background Cr3+ and in presence of 1.0 sM background Cu2+, but it is significantly depressed in presence of 10.0 sM Cu2+. Changes of the spectral slope of the log-transformed absorbance spectra in the 350-400 nm wavelength range (S350-400) were unambiguously correlated with the total amount of DOM-bound metals. The concentrations of Me-DOM complexes were determined using the NICA-Donnan Model. The results demonstrate that differential absorbance measurements provide quantitatively interpretable information concerning the nature and mechanisms of metal-DOM interactions and effects of metal cations competition on these processes.

To acquire a better insight we studied the fouling of the DOM fractions humic acids (HAs) and fulvic acids (FAs), with and without Ca2+, on native and grafted ceramic NF membranes. Grafting with two methods and three different grafting groups allowed to create a range of membranes with a variety of surface chemistries, and a wide range of surface polarity, much broader than ever used in previous studies. A typical polymer (polyamide) NF membrane was included for comparison. All obtained results reveal that membrane fouling is not determined by membrane hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity as a general and sole criterion, but rather on the whole of the surface chemistry determining the amount and strength of the possible foulant membrane interactions. As a consequence the effect of inorganic ions on the fouling is also dependent on the surface chemistry. Important new insight in the DOM fouling mechanism was acquired, shedding new light on the state-of-the-art knowledge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Urbanization and agriculture increase exports and differentially alter elemental stoichiometry of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from tropical catchments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many tropical biomes are threatened by rapid land-use change, but its catchment-wide biogeochemical effects are poorly understood. The few previous studies on DOM in tropical catchments suggest that deforestation and subsequent land use increase stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, but consistent effects on DOM elemental stoichiometry have not yet been reported. Here, we studied stream water DOC concentrations, catchment DOC exports, and DOM elemental stoichiometry in 20 tropical catchments at the Corrado-Allan tic rainforest transition, dominated by natural vegetation, pasture, intensive agriculture, and urban land cover. Streams draining pasture could be distinguished from those draining natural catchments by their lower DOC concentrations, with lower DOM C:N and C:P ratios. Catchments with intensive agriculture had higher DOC exports and lower DOM C:P ratios than natural catchments. Finally, with the highest DOC concentrations and exports, as well as the highest. DOM C:P and N:P ratios, bid the lowest C:N ratios among all land-use types, urbanized catchments had the strongest effects on catchment DOM. Thus, urbanization may have alleviated N limitation of heterotrophic DOM decomposition, bud increased P limitation. Land use especially urbanization also affected the seasonality of catchment biogeochemistry. While natural catchments exhibited high DOC exports and concentrations, with high DOM C:P ratios in the rainy season only, urbanized catchments had high values in these variables throughout the year. Our results suggest that urbanization and pastoral land use exerted the strongest impacts on biogeochemistry in the investigated tropical catchments and should thus be important targets for management and mitigation efforts.

Complete and Partial Photo-oxidation of Dissolved Organic Matter Draining Permafrost Soils	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and partially oxidized compounds is an important component of the carbon cycle in the Arctic. Thawing permafrost soils will change the chemical composition of DOM exported to arctic surface waters, but the molecular controls on DOM photodegradation remain poorly understood, making it difficult to predict how inputs of thawing permafrost DOM may alter its photodegradation. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the susceptibility of DOM draining the shallow organic mat and the deeper permafrost layer of arctic soils to complete and partial photo oxidation and investigated changes in the chemical composition of each DOM source following sunlight exposure. Permafrost and organic mat DOM had similar lability to photomineralization despite substantial differences in initial chemical composition. Concurrent losses Of carboxyl moieties and shifts in chemical composition during photodegradation indicated that photodecarboxylation could account for 40-90% of DOM photomineralized to CO2. Permafrost DOM had a higher susceptibility to partial photo-Oxidation compared to organic mat DOM, potentially due to a lower abundance of phenolic moieties with antioxidant properties. These results suggest that photodegradation will likely continue to be an important control on DOM fate in arctic freshwaters as the climate warms and permafrost soils thaw.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 5	2016	50	7					3545	3553		10.1021/acs.est.5b05354						WOS:000373655800030	26910810	
J	Armanious, A; Munch, M; Kohn, T; Sander, M				Armanious, Antonius; Muench, Melanie; Kohn, Tamar; Sander, Michael			Competitive Coadsorption Dynamics of Viruses and Dissolved Organic Matter to Positively Charged Sorbent Surfaces	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Adsorption onto solid water interfaces is a key process governing the fate and transport of waterborne viruses. Although negatively charged viruses are known to extensively adsorb onto positively charged adsorbent surfaces, virus adsorption in such systems in the presence of negatively charged dissolved organic matter (DOM) as coadsorbate remains poorly studied and understood. This work provides a systematic assessment of the adsorption dynamics of negatively charged viruses (i.e., bacteriophages MS2, fr, GA, and Qj3) and polystyrene nanospheres onto a positively charged model sorbent surface in the presence of varying DOM concentrations. In all systems studied, DOM competitively suppressed the adsorption of the viruses and nanospheres onto the model surface. Electrostatic repulsion of the highly negatively charged MS2, fr, and the nanospheres impaired their adsorption onto DOM adlayers that formed during the toadsmption process. In contrast, the effect of competition on overall adsorption was attenuated for less-negatively charged GA and Q beta because these viruses also adsorbed onto DOM adlayer surfaces. Competition in MS2-DOM coadsorbate systems were accurately described by a random sequential adsorption model that explicitly accounts for the unfolding of adsorbed DOM. Consistent findings for viruses and nanospheres suggest that the coadsorbate effects described herein generally apply to systems containing negatively charged nanoparticles and DOM.

J	Mayora, G; Devercelli, M; Frau, D				Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina; Frau, Diego			Spatial variability of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in a large floodplain river: control factors and relations with phytoplankton during a low water period	ECOHYDROLOGY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) affects ecological processes in freshwater environments. Few studies assessed its spatial variability and relations with phytoplankton in floodplain rivers. Therefore, these topics were examined in a hydrological connectivity gradient in the Middle Parana system. Absorption coefficients at 250 and 365 nm were measured to estimate CDOM concentration and molecular weight (MW), to find their explanatory limnological variables (Redundancy Analysis, RDA), and to assess their contribution to the explanation of phytoplankton structure (Canonical Correspondence Analysis, CCA). Conductivity and turbidity explained CDOM significantly. Increased conductivity from the main channel to floodplain lakes was associated with increased CDOM concentration. The lake indirectly connected to the river showed the highest turbidity associated with high-MW-CDOM, while the isolated lake showed the highest conductivity associated with low-MW-CDOM. Phytoplankton structure was significantly explained by conductivity, turbidity, and high-MW-CDOM (CCA). Environments directly connected to the river (with the lowest conductivity) were associated with diatoms. Phytoflagellates were associated with turbidity and high-MW-CDOM in the lake indirectly connected to the river, whereas Cyanobacteria were associated with conductivity and low-MW-CDOM in the isolated lake. The combined effect of physical factors and CDOM explained the highest fraction of species variation (partial CCA). As a conclusion: (1) CDOM increases as hydrological connectivity with the river decreases; (2) lake sediment resuspension is linked to an increase of high-MW-CDOM; (3) lake isolation from the river corresponds to an increase in low-MW-CDOM; and (4) CDOM explains phytoplankton structure significantly and should be considered as an important variable in studies of microalgal assembly.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), spectroscopic indices (i.e., specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, SUVA254; spectral slope ratio, SR; fluorescence index, FI; humification index, HIX), fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy in combination with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PAR-AFAC) were applied to assess how extreme storm altered the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM properties between pre- and post-storm were significantly distinguished. The torm promoted increased DOC and DON concentrations respectively by 15 and 76 %. The humic-like fluorescence intensities increased by 10 %, and the fluorescence intensities of tyrosine-like substances increased while these of tryptophan-like substances decreased. Moreover, the DOM quality in streams shifted to higher HIX and SUVA254 but lower SR and FI. In addition, 16 subcatchments were clustered into four groups according to the dominated land use types. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the differences in DOM properties among subcatchments were associated with the dominated land use types during storm. Our findings suggested that elevated DOC and DON concentration were associated with the proportion of residential area and planted forest land (Phyllostachys praecox), respectively. Humic-like materials were related to the proportion of native forest land and cropland, while protein-like components were associated with planted forest land. Extreme storm events will strengthen the linkage between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and further alter DOM in both quantity and quality in headwater streams, which is also associated with land use types in the watershed.

DOM in the Pearl River around metropolitan Guangzhou and its six fractions obtained by sequential resins separation and their percentage distribution of total organic carbon (TOC), the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), and the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)) were determined. Meanwhile, fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to examine the biodegradable and structural characteristics of DOM. The results showed that the values of TOC, UV254, and SUVA(254) changed with season. Especially, SUVA(254) was lower than 3 L (mg m)(-1), indicating that the hydrophilic fractions were the major components of the DOM. Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the dominant presence of humic-like, fulvic-like, and protein-like fluorophores. Fluorescence index (FI) in four seasons was associated with allochthonous DOM sources and biological DOM. FTIR spectroscopy suggested the feature of DOM with some specific groups (e.g., carbohydrate C-O, amid Ca center dot O).																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2016	23	8					7462	7469		10.1007/s11356-015-5999-9						WOS:000374994600041	26711291

K.; Jin, Bo			Characterisation of dissolved organic matter in stormwater using high-performance size exclusion chromatography	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Understanding the complexity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in stormwater has drawn a lot of interest, since DOM from stormwater causes not only environmental impacts, but also worsens downstream aquatic quality associated with water supply and treatability. This study introduced and employed high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled with an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diode array detector to assess changes in stormwater-associated DOM characteristics. Stormwater DOM was also analysed in relation to storm event characteristics, water quality and spectroscopic analysis. Statistical tools were used to determine the correlations within DOM and water quality measurements. Results showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) as conventional DOM parameters were found to be correlated well to the changes in stormwater quality during each of the three storm events studied. Both detector wavelengths (210 and 254 nm) and their ratio (A(210)/A(254)) were found to provide additional information on the physiochemical properties of stormwater-associated DOM. This study indicated that A(210)/A(254) is an important parameter which could be used to estimate the DOM proportions of functional groups and conjugated carbon species. This study provided also an understanding of stormwater quality constituents through assessing variability and sensitivity for various parameters, and the additional information of rainfall characteristics on runoff quality data for a better understanding of parameter correlations and influences.

Optical Models for Remote Sensing of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter Absorption and Salinity in New England, Middle Atlantic and Gulf Coast Estuaries USA	REMOTE SENSING												Ocean color algorithms have been successfully developed to estimate chlorophyll a and total suspended solids concentrations in coastal and estuarine waters but few have been created to estimate light absorption due to colored dissolved inorganic matter (CDOM) and salinity from the spectral signatures of these waters. In this study, we used remotely sensed reflectances in the red and blue-green portions of the visible spectrum retrieved from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the International Space Station (ISS) Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) images to create a model to estimate CDOM absorption. CDOM absorption results were then used to develop an algorithm to predict the surface salinities of coastal bays and estuaries in New England, Middle Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico regions. Algorithm-derived CDOM absorptions and salinities were successfully validated using laboratory measured absorption values over magnitudes of similar to 0.1 to 7.0 m(-1) and field collected CTD data from oligohaline to polyhaline (S less than 5 to 18-30) environments in Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island); the Neuse River Estuary (North Carolina); Pensacola Bay (Florida); Choctawhatchee Bay (Florida); St. Andrews Bay (Florida); St. Joseph Bay (Florida); and inner continental shelf waters of the Gulf of Mexico.																	2072-4292					APR	2016	8	4							283	10.3390/rs8040283						WOS:000375156500016		
J	Rathgeb, A; Causon, T; Krachler, R; Hann, S				Rathgeb, Anna; Causon, Tim; Krachler, Regina; Hann, Stephan			Determination of size-dependent metal distribution in dissolved organic matter by SEC-UV/VIS-ICP-MS with special focus on changes in seawater	ELECTROPHORESIS												Iron is an essential micronutrient for all marine organisms, but it is also a growth limiting factor as the iron concentrations in the open ocean are below 1 nmol/L in sea water iron is almost entirely bound to organic ligands of the dissolved organic matter fraction, which are mostly of unknown structure. The input from rivers was traditionally considered as less important due to estuarine sedimentation processes of the mainly colloidal iron particles. However, recent studies have shown that this removal is not complete and riverine input may represent an important iron source in the open ocean. In this context, iron transport by land-derived natural organic matter (NOM), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) have been identified as carrier mechanisms for riverine iron. The aim of this work is to characterize complexes containing iron and other metals in waters simulating estuarine conditions in order to help understand which role iron-DOM compounds play in the open ocean. A method based on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with sequential UV/VIS and ICP-MS detection was developed for investigation of DOM size distribution and for assessment of the size-dependent metal distribution in NOM-rich surface water. Furthermore, sample matrix experiments were also performed revealing a dependence of DOM size distribution upon seawater concentration and different compounds present in seawater. Finally, efforts toward determination of DOM size with standardization with typical SEC standards indicate that only relative comparisons are possible with this approach, and that the sample matrix composition strongly influences obtained results.

Characterising changes in fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter and links to N cycling in agricultural floodplains	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Sand and gravel aquifer systems are common features below and adjacent to river networks and are important in providing a hydrological link between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They are often used for intensive agriculture and therefore provide a conduit for the transport of nutrients to aquatic systems. Understanding the biogeochemical cycles of C and N in such systems is essential in efforts to improve water quality, with a major link being the transfer and properties of DOM which drives microbial processing of nutrients. In this work undertaken in the Trent Valley, U.K., the differences in dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties in the soil, aquifer ground water and river water are examined using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM), in addition to chemical analysis. In the aquifer system studied the water table is similar to 1.5 m below the land surface, suggesting that DOM and nutrient transfer would occur between the soil and groundwater. Nitrate levels in the ground water were similar to 50 mg L-1 NO3-N. Soil DOM properties were measured in KCl extracts used to extract inorganic and organic N so that further information could be obtained regarding possible sources and properties of the DON and the biodegradability of the DOC pool. Within the soils tested, fulvic-like properties and the humification index (HI) were significantly (P<0.05) higher in sandy soils suggesting that microbial accessibility to organic matter was greater. The applicability of assessing DOM characteristics in the different matrices were assessed and quantitative or qualitative comparisons made. Properties of DOM in both the soils and aquifer waters all showed a typical terrestrial source with principal component analysis (PCA) showing strong correlations between DOC, fulvic-like properties, the HI and tryptophan-like properties. A major finding was that the HI was generally higher in the groundwater, suggesting continued processing of DOM within the aquifer whilst qualitative comparisons showed the groundwater possessed a higher fluorescence index (Fl). Whilst DON and the tyrosine-like proteins were correlated in the soil, the tryptophan-like proteins were strongly correlated to fulvic-like substances in both the soil and groundwater. This suggested that phenolic compounds were also being identified in this part of the EEM matrix, emphasising the need for additional compound analysis to fully understand the nature of DOM in these systems.

The number of potential solutions for an elemental formula increases exponentially with increasing molecular mass, especially when non-oxygen heteroatoms like N, S or P are included. A method was developed from the chemical perspective and validated using a Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) dataset which is dominated by components consisting exclusively of C, H and O (78 % CHO). In order to get information on the application range and robustness of this method, we investigated a FT-ICR-MS dataset which was merged from 18 mine pit lake pore waters and 3 river floodplain soil waters. This dataset contained 50 % CHO and 18 % CHOS on average, whereas the former SRFA dataset contained only 1.5 % CHOS. The mass calculator was configured to allow up to five nitrogen atoms and up to one sulphur atom in assigning formulas to mass peaks. More than 50 % multiple-formula assignments were found for peaks with masses > 650 Da. Based on DBE -aEuro parts per thousand O frequency diagrams, many CHO, CHOS1, CHON1 and CHON1S1 molecular series were ultimately assigned to many m/z and considered to be reliable solutions. The unequivocal data pool could thus be enlarged by 523 (6.8 %) CHOS1 components. In contrast to the method validation with CHO-rich SRFA, validation with sulphur-rich pit lake samples showed that formulas with a higher number of non-oxygen heteroatoms can be more reliable assignments in many cases. As an example: CHOS molecular series were reliable and the CHO classes were unreliable amongst other molecular classes in many multiple-formula assignments from the sulphur-rich pit lake samples.

As a consequence, dissolved organic carbon concentration in soil leachates can be increased and potentially modify the transport of other solutes. This study aims to characterize the processes controlling the mobility of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in deep soil layers and their potential impacts on the leaching of organic contaminants (pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds) potentially present in cultivated soils receiving organic waste composts. We sampled undisturbed soil cores in the illuviated horizon (60-90 cm depth) of an Albeluvisol. Percolation experiments were made in presence and absence of DOM with two different pesticides, isoproturon and epoxiconazole, and two pharmaceutical compounds, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. Two types of DOM were extracted from two different soil surface horizons: one sampled in a plot receiving a co-compost of green wastes and sewage sludge applied once every 2 years since 1998 and one sampled in an unamended plot. Results show that DOM behaved as a highly reactive solute, which was continuously generated within the soil columns during flow and increased after flow interruption. DOM significantly increased the mobility of bromide and all pollutants, but the effects differed according the hydrophobic and the ionic character of the molecules. However, no clear effects of the origin of DOM on the mobility of the different contaminants were observed.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2016	23	7					6907	6918		10.1007/s11356-015-5938-9						WOS:000373632400084	26676540

More than one trillion tons of DOM are stocked in the world's aquatic ecosystems. DOM is a very important part of aquatic ecosystem productivity and plays a crucial role in global carbon cycling. DOM has rich environmental behaviors and effects such as influencing the bioavailability of contaminants, serving as an important inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protecting aquatic organisms from the harm of dangerous ultraviolet radiation. There have been many systematic studies on the composition, structure, and sources of DOM because such studies are much easier to conduct than studies on the environmental behaviors and effects of DOM. Due to many factors, the research systems of DOM's environmental behaviors and effects are still being developed and have become a hotspot of environmental science. This review paper focuses on some critical progress, problems, and trends of DOM's environmental behaviors and effects in aquatic ecosystems, including mutual exchange mechanisms between DOM and particulate organic matter (POM) with influencing factors, photochemical behaviors of DOM especially inducing ROS, binding interactions between DOM and anthropogenic organic contaminants (AOC), interactions between DOM and microorganisms, effects of DOM on pollutants' bioavailability, ecotoxicity, and ecological risks. Hopefully, this paper will contribute to a more systematic understanding of the DOM environmental behaviors and effects and to promoting further relevant studies.																	1674-7313	1869-1897				APR	2016	59	4					746	759		10.1007/s11430-015-5248-6						WOS:000372544800007

The share of organic soil was the strongest predictor of high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (DOC, DON, and DOP, respectively), and was linked to DOM quality. Soil type was more important than land use in determining the concentration and quality of riverine DOM. On average, 5-9 % of the DOC and 45 % of the DON were degraded by the bacterial communities within 2-3 months. Simultaneously, the proportion of humic-like compounds in the DOM pool increased. Bioavailable DON accounted for approximately one-third of the total bioavailable dissolved nitrogen, and thus, terrestrial DON can markedly contribute to the coastal plankton dynamics and support the heterotrophic food web.

In this study we investigated bacterial DOM degradation rates in the tributaries of the reservoirs and tested the hypotheses that (1) DOM degradation is high enough to decrease DOM loads to reservoirs considerably, (2) DOM degradation is affected by stream hydrology, and (3) phosphorus addition may stimulate bacterial DOM degradation. Bacterial biomass production, which was used as a measure of DOM degradation, was highest in summer, and was usually lower at upstream than at downstream sites. An important proportion of bacterial production was realized in epilithic biofilms. Production of planktonic and biofilm bacteria was related to water temperature. Planktonic production weakly correlated to DOM quality and to total phosphorus concentration. Addition of soluble reactive phosphorus did not stimulate bacterial DOM degradation. Overall, DOM was considerably degraded in summer at low discharge levels, whereas degradation was negligible during flood events (when DOM load in reservoirs was high). The ratio of DOM degradation to total DOM release was negatively related to discharge. On annual average, only 0.6-12% of total DOM released by the catchments was degraded within the tributaries.

J	Massicotte, P; Markager, S				Massicotte, Philippe; Markager, Stiig			Using a Gaussian decomposition approach to model absorption spectra of chromophoric dissolved organic matter	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a significant water constituent influencing inherent and apparent optical properties of natural waters and plays a key role in ecosystem functioning. The spectral slope (S) describing the approximate exponential decline in CDOM absorption with increasing wavelength is widely used for tracing changes in the chemical composition of CDOM. The currently accepted method of characterizing CDOM absorption (i.e., fitting a simple exponential model) can lead to loss of information and large errors. We propose a better method for modeling CDOM absorption spectra based on a Gaussian decomposition approach that removes the errors associated with the choice of the spectral range used to estimate S. Using artificially generated spectra with known parameters (n = 1000), we show that our method provides robust estimates of S closely resembling the original values. On average, the error on S estimations was 0.16% for the proposed method compared to 27% and 11% for the traditional modeling approaches fitted over 300-700 nm and 240-700 nm respectively. We further demonstrate the ability of the method to decompose and model chromophores present in complex spectra from oceanic water samples from around the world. The proposed method opens avenues for long-term or cross-site comparison studies of the dynamics of the CDOM pool and constitutes a promising supplement to techniques based on CDOM fluorescence.

Furthermore, the relationships between the M. aeruginosa-DOM spectroscopic descriptors and the pyrene binding coefficient (K-DOC) values were explored. The results showed that the spectroscopic characteristics of the M. aeruginosa-DOM and the binding properties of pyrene were dynamically changed along with the algae growth. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that a higher pyrene K-DOC value was observed for the M. aeruginosa-DOM that has a higher humification index (HIX) value, a lower biological index (BIX) value and a lower absorption ratio (E2/E3). The presence of protein like and long-wavelength-excited humic-like components may impose negative and positive effects on binding of pyrene by the M. aeruginosa-DOM, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) further supported that the binding affinity of pyrene may be primarily influenced by the humification degree of the M. aeruginosa-DOM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, information on bacterioplankton-DOM interactions on a molecular level is limited. We examined the variation of bacterial community composition (BCC) at Helgoland Roads (North Sea) in relation to variation of molecular DOM composition and various environmental parameters on short-time scales. Surface water samples were taken daily over a period of 20 days. Bacterial community and molecular DOM composition were assessed via 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing and ultrahigh resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), respectively. Environmental conditions were driven by a coastal water influx during the first half of the sampling period and the onset of a summer phytoplankton bloom toward the end of the sampling period. These phenomena led to a distinct grouping of bacterial communities and DOM composition which was particularly influenced by total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration, temperature, and salinity, as revealed by distance-based linear regression analyses. Bacterioplankton-DOM interaction was demonstrated in strong correlations between specific bacterial taxa and particular DOM molecules, thus, suggesting potential specialization on particular substrates. We propose that a combination of high resolution techniques, as used in this study, may provide substantial information on substrate generalists and specialists and thus, contribute to prediction of BCC variation.

The parameters were the initial ozone demand (IOD), ozone decay rate constant after the IOD (k(sec)), ratio of OH radical exposure to the ozone exposure (R-Ct), and ratio of ozone consumption to the OH radial exposure multiplied by the second-order rate constant for the reaction of the OH radical with an OH radical probe compound (). The seasonal variations in water quality had the most significant influence on R-Ct (39-64%), followed by k(sec) (35-38%), (27-34%), and IOD (11-25%) for the raw lake water and sand-filtered water in which the numbers inside parentheses indicate the percent standard deviation of the measured values for 1year. For the oligotrophic-type lake water, the seasonal variation in water temperature (6-26 degrees C) had the most significant influence on the k(sec), R-Ct, and . The was newly found to be inversely related with water temperature, possibly due to the temperature-dependent OH radical yield from ozone decomposition. This implies that the OH radical oxidation capacity during ozonation can be significantly influenced by the temperature due to the varying ozone decomposition rate and the intrinsic OH radical yield. This study also demonstrated the is a useful, alternative parameter to the R-Ct for describing or predicting OH radical exposure from ozone consumption especially when the ozone decay is rapid or varies over time such as the initial ozonation phase of natural water or wastewater where a considerable OH radical exposure takes place.																	0191-9512	1547-6545				MAR 3	2016	38	2					100	114		10.1080/01919512.2015.1079120						WOS:000372016700004

In this study, adsorption of two selected SAs (sulfapyridine and sulfathiazole) by two reduced graphene oxides (rGO1 and rGO2) was examined as affected by pH and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Adsorption of SAs by rGOs was highly pH-dependent, and adsorption affinity of different SAs species followed the order of SA(0) > SA(+) > SA(-). The contribution of SA(0) to the overall adsorption was greater than its species fraction, implying the importance of the neutral species to adsorption. SAs adsorption isotherms at three selected pHs were in the order of pH 5.0 > pH 1.0 > pH 11.0, which was in accordance with the variation of site energy distribution analysis. Hydrophobic interaction, pi-pi EDA interaction and electrostatic interaction were the main mechanisms responsible for SAs adsorption by rGOs. Three representative natural DOMs including humic acid (HA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and sodium alginate together with sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) as a synthetic DOM were used to investigate their effect on SAs adsorption. The inhibition impact of DOM on SAs adsorption was lower for rGOs compared with carbon nanotubes and graphite, which might be attributed to the higher oxygen contents of rGOs. Also, the suppression effect of DOM generally followed an order of SDBS > HA >= BSA > alginate, indicating the importance role of DOM compositions. These results should be important for assessing the fate and transport of graphene and antibiotics in the environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gutierrez, MF; Mayora, G				Florencia Gutierrez, Maria; Mayora, Gisela			Influence of macrophyte integrity on zooplankton habitat preference, emphasizing the released phenolic compounds and chromophoric dissolved organic matter	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Macrophyte health status can influence the composition of their exudates causing different effects on zooplankton behavior and distribution in nature. We hypothesize that: (1) the release of phenolic compounds and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) depends on macrophyte species and its health status (broken macrophytes: BM, or healthy macrophytes: HM); (2) the repellency effect depends on zooplankton species, macrophyte species and its health status; and (3) higher concentrations of phenolic compounds and CDOM produce a stronger repellency effect. Phenolic compounds and CDOM were analyzed in exudates of BM and HM of Salvinia sp., Eichhornia crassipes, Pistia stratiotes, Azolla sp. and Ludwigia peploides. Through a flow-through experiment, the repellency produced by these exudates was assessed in two copepods (Notodiaptomus conifer and Argyrodiaptomus falcifer) and one cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia). Our hypotheses were partially validated. The quantity of exudated phenolic compounds and CDOM depended on macrophyte species and, to a lesser extent, on the plant health status. The repellency effect was affected by macrophyte and zooplankton species but not by the health status of plants. Only C. dubia and A. falcifer increased their evasion behavior when phenolic compound and CDOM concentrations increased. In brief, the structuring effect of repellent substances depends on different factors. Under a certain threshold concentration, zooplankton behavior might depend on the information associated with the plant odor (e.g., predation risk, structural complexity) more than on the quantity of the released chemical compounds.

A set of forest and wetland soils with and without the nitrogen deposition were incubated in the growth chambers under three different temperatures. The moisture contents were kept constant, except for two-week drying intervals. Comparisons between the original and the treated samples revealed that drying-rewetting was a crucial environmental factor driving changes in the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The DOC was also notably increased by the nitrogen deposition to the dry forest soil and was affected by the temperature of the dry wetland soil. A parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis identified three sub-fractions of the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) from the fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), and their compositions depended on drying-rewetting. The data as a whole, including the DOC and PARAFAC components and other optical indices, were possibly explained by the two main variables, which were closely related with the PARAFAC components and DOC based on principal component analysis (PCA). Our results suggested that the DOC and PARAFAC component information could provide a comprehensive interpretation of the changes in the soil-leached DOM in response to the different environmental conditions.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2016	23	6					5203	5213		10.1007/s11356-015-5740-8						WOS:000373609300020	26561321

The bench-scale experiments showed that as well as activated carbon, anion exchange resin could efficiently remove both aniline-like and humic-like fluorescent components, which can be up to 40 % of dissolved organic matter. The humic-like fluorescent component HS-Em460-Ex3 was more hydrophilic than HS-Em430-Ex2 and contained fewer alkyl chains but more acid groups. As a result, HS-Em460-Ex3 was eliminated more preferentially by NDMP anion exchange. However, compared with adsorption resins, the polarity of fluorescent components had a relatively small effect on the performance of anion exchange resin. The long-term pilot-scale experiments showed that the NDMP anion exchange process could remove approximately 30 % of the chemical oxygen demand and about 90 % of color from the biologically treated textile effluents. Once the issue of waste brine from resin desorption is solved, the NDMP anion exchange process could be a promising alternative for the advanced treatment of textile effluents.

Wastewater from animal farms or pharmaceutical plants usually contains high concentration of antibiotics. In this study, the quenching effect of antibiotics on the typical components of DOM was explored using fluorescence EEM-PARAFAC analysis. Four antibiotics (roxarsone, sulfaquinoxaline sodium, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin) at the concentration of 0.5 similar to 4.0 mg/L and three typical components of DOM (tyrosine, tryptophan, and humic acid) were selected. Fluorescence quenching effects were observed with the addition of antibiotics. Among these four antibiotics, roxarsone (2.9 similar to 20.2 %), sulfaquinoxaline sodium (0 similar to 32.0 %), and oxytetracycline (0 similar to 41.8 %) led to a stronger quenching effect than erythromycin (0 similar to 8.0 %). From the side of DOM, tyrosine and tryptophan (0.5 similar to 41.8 %) exhibited a similar quenching effect, but they were higher than humic acids (0 similar to 20.2 %) at the same concentration of antibiotics. For humic acid, a significant quenching effect was observed only with the addition of roxarsone. This might be the first report about the fluorescence quenching effect caused by antibiotics. The results from this study confirmed the interference of antibiotics on the fluorescence intensity of the main components of DOM and highlighted the importance of correcting fluorescence data in the wastewater containing antibiotics.

The sample set was comprised of ultrafiltered DOM (UDOM) from North American headwater streams associated with Long Term Ecological Research network sites. Pyrolysis products for each UDOM sample were categorized as being sourced from non pyrogenic sources and DBC. Major non-pyrogenic components of the headwater stream UDOM were comprised of phenolic compounds derived from lignin and chitin markers from microbial biomass, and their relative contributions indicated differences in organic matter dynamics of these ecosystems. The DBC pyrolyzates included benzene, PAHs and benzonitriles, which accounted for 12.5 +/- 4.5% of total quantified peak area (TPQA), and decreased in the order Alaskan boreal forest (19%), Alaskan tundra (17%), Appalachian deciduous forest (11%), Colorado alpine tundra (9%), Puerto Rican mountainous tropical rainforest (9%) and Kansas tallgrass prairie (7%). Pyrolysis products were compared to DBC content as determined by the benzenepolycarboxylic acid (SPCA) method. Although Py-GC-MS has quantitative limitations, this technique can detect weakly condensed and other DBC structures which fall outside of the BPCA analytical window. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Chloroflexi CL500-11 Populations That Predominate Deep-Lake Hypolimnion Bacterioplankton Rely on Nitrogen-Rich Dissolved Organic Matter Metabolism and C-1 Compound Oxidation	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The Chloroflexi CL500-11 clade contributes a large proportion of the bacterial biomass in the oxygenated hypolimnia of deep lakes worldwide, including the world's largest freshwater system, the Laurentian Great Lakes. Traits that allow CL500-11 to thrive and its biogeochemical role in these environments are currently unknown. Here, we found that a CL500-11 population was present mostly in offshore waters along a transect in ultraoligotrophic Lake Michigan (a Laurentian Great Lake). It occurred throughout the water column in spring and only in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, contributing up to 18.1% of all cells. Genome reconstruction from metagenomic data suggested an aerobic, motile, heterotrophic lifestyle, with additional energy being gained through carboxidovory and methylovory. Comparisons to other available streamlined freshwater genomes revealed that the CL500-11 genome contained a disproportionate number of cell wall/capsule biosynthesis genes and the most diverse spectrum of genes involved in the uptake of dissolved organic matter (DOM) substrates, particularly peptides. In situ expression patterns indicated the importance of DOM uptake and protein/peptide turnover, as well as type I and type II carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and flagellar motility. Its location in the water column influenced its gene expression patterns the most. We observed increased bacteriorhodopsin gene expression and a response to oxidative stress in surface waters compared to its response in deep waters. While CL500-11 carries multiple adaptations to an oligotrophic lifestyle, its investment in motility, its large cell size, and its distribution in both oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes indicate its ability to thrive under conditions where resources are more plentiful. Our data indicate that CL500-11 plays an important role in nitrogen-rich DOM mineralization in the extensive deep-lake hypolimnion habitat.																	0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2016	82	5					1423	1432		10.1128/AEM.03014-15						WOS:000373338800007

The resulting fluorescence spectra revealed three protein-like components (high-excitation wavelength tyrosine, low-excitation wavelength tyrosine, low-excitation wavelength tryptophan) and two fulvic-like components (ultraviolet fulvic-like components, visible fulvic-like components) in the overlying water. Moreover, the protein-like components were dominant in the overlying water's DOM. The fluorescence intensity of the protein-like components decreased significantly after aeration. Two of the protein-like components the low excitation wavelength tyrosine and the low-excitation wavelength tryptophan were more susceptible to degradation by microorganisms within the degradable organic matter with respect to the high-excitation wavelength tyrosine. In contrast, the ultraviolet and visible fulvic-like fluorescence intensity increased along with increasing DO concentration, indicating that the fulvic-like components were part of the refractory organics. The fluorescence indices of the DOM in the overlying water were between 1.65 similar to 1.80, suggesting that the sources of the DOM were related to terrigenous sediments and microbial metabolic processes, with the primary source being the contribution from microbial metabolism. The fluorescence indices increased along with DO growth, which showed that microbial biomass and microbial activity gradually increased with increasing DO while microbial metabolism also improved, which also increased the biogenic components in the overlying water. The fluorescence intensity of the high-excitation wavelength tyrosine peak A showed a good linear relationship with the total nitrogen concentration at higher DO concentrations of 2.5, 3.5, and 5.5 mg . L-1, with r(2) being 0.956, 0.946, and 0.953, respectively. This study demonstrated that excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy can distinguish the transformation characteristics of the DOM and identify the linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the high-excitation wavelength tyrosine peak A and total nitrogen concentration, thus providing a quick and effective technique and theoretical support for river water monitoring and water restoration.																	1000-0593					MAR	2016	36	3					890	895		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)03-0890-06						WOS:000372478000053		
J	Yan, J; Lazouskaya, V; Jin, Y				Yan, Jing; Lazouskaya, Volha; Jin, Yan			Soil Colloid Release Affected by Dissolved Organic Matter and Redox Conditions	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Mobilization of soil colloids has attracted much research attention because of colloids' potential to facilitate transport of strongly sorbing constituents (e.g., contaminants, pesticides, and nutrients). In redox-dynamic soils or sediments, colloid mobility is largely controlled by Fe3+ dissolution, shifts in pH and ionic strength, and interactions with organic matter (OM). We investigated the complex interplay of colloid release, OM content, and redox conditions via batch experiments to quantify and characterize soil colloid release after the addition of dissolved OM (DOM). Under aerobic conditions, the concentration of released colloids increased from similar to 1000 to similar to 3000 mg L-1 as the DOM concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg C L-1, respectively. The initial concentrations of released colloids were higher under anaerobic conditions, but they decreased by similar to 80 to 90% as incubation continued. In addition, unlike in the aerobic samples, the effects of the added DOM on colloid release in the anaerobic samples were minimal. Iron dissolution under anaerobic conditions coincided with the initial high level of colloid release as well as the release of indigenous DOM (DOMin), which may have led to subsequent colloid aggregation due to bridging. These results demonstrate that (i) DOM stabilized the colloids released under aerobic conditions but had minimal effects on colloids released under anaerobic conditions and (ii) high concentrations of DOMin released under anaerobic conditions decreased subsequent colloid release due to DOMin-colloid association. The findings have implications for colloid release and colloid-associated nutrient and contaminant mobilization and transport in redox-dynamic environments such as wetlands.																	1539-1663					MAR	2016	15	3								10.2136/vzj2015.02.0026						WOS:000372808500001

Hydrology controls dissolved organic matter export and composition in an Alpine stream and its hyporheic zone	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Streams and rivers transport dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the terrestrial environment to downstream ecosystems. In light of climate and global change it is crucial to understand the temporal dynamics of DOM concentration and composition, and its export fluxes from headwaters to larger downstream ecosystems. We monitored DOM concentration and composition based on a diurnal sampling design for 3 years in an Alpine headwater stream. We found hydrologic variability to control DOM composition and the coupling of DOM dynamics in the streamwater and the hyporheic zone. High-flow events increased DOM inputs from terrestrial sources (as indicated by the contributions of humic- and fulvic-like fluorescence), while summer baseflow enhanced the autochthonous imprint of DOM. Diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM composition were likely induced by biological processes linked to temperature and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Floods frequently interrupted diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM, which led to a decoupling of streamwater and hyporheic water DOM composition and delivery of aromatic and humic-like DOM to the streamwater. Accordingly, DOM export fluxes were largely of terrigenous origin as indicated by optical properties. Our study highlights the relevance of hydrologic and seasonal dynamics for the origin, composition and fluxes of DOM in an Alpine headwater stream.

J	Conte, P; Kucerik, J				Conte, Pellegrino; Kucerik, Jiri			Water Dynamics and Its Role in Structural Hysteresis of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Knowledge of structural dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of paramount importance for understanding DOM stability and role in the fate of solubilized organic and inorganic compounds (e.g., nutrients and pollutants), either in soils or aquatic systems. In this study, fast field cycling (FFC) H-1 NMR relaxometry was applied to elucidate structural dynamics of terrestrial DOM, represented by two structurally contrasting DOM models such as Suwanee River (SRFA) and Pahokee peat (PPFA) fulvic acids purchased by the International Humic Substance Society. Measurement of NMR relaxation rate of water protons in heating cooling cycles revealed structural hysteresis in both fulvic acids. In particular, structural hysteresis was related to the delay in re-establishing water network around fulvic molecules as a result of temperature fluctuations. The experiments revealed that the structural temperature dependency and hysteresis were more pronounced in SRFA than in PPFA. This was attributed to the larger content of hydrogel-like structure in SRFA stabilized, at a larger extent, by H-bonds between carboxylic and phenolic groups. Moreover, results supported the view that terrestrial DOM consist of a hydrophobic rigid core surrounded by progressively assembling amphiphilic and polar molecules, which form an elastic structure that can mediate reactivity of the whole DOM.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 1	2016	50	5					2210	2216		10.1021/acs.est.5b04639						WOS:000371371700011	26815011

Here, we examine the molecular fractionation of DOM induced by adsorption onto three common iron oxyhydroxides using electrospray ionization coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Ferrihydrite exhibited higher affinity to DOM and induced more pronounced molecular fractionation of DOM than did goethite or lepidocrocite. High molecular weight (>500 Da) compounds and compounds high in unsaturation or rich in oxygen including polycyclic aromatics, polyphenols and carboxylic compounds had higher affinity to iron oxyhydroxides and especially to ferrihydrite. Low molecular weight compounds and compounds low in unsaturation or containing few oxygenated groups (mainly alcohols and ethers) were preferentially maintained in solution. This study confirms that the double bond equivalence and the number of oxygen atoms are valuable parameters indicating the selective fractionation of DOM at mineral and water interfaces. The results of this study provide important information for further understanding the behavior of DOM in the natural environment.

J	Mangal, V; Stock, NL; Gueguen, C				Mangal, Vaughn; Stock, Naomi L.; Gueguen, Celine			Molecular characterization of phytoplankton dissolved organic matter (DOM) and sulfur components using high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with electrospray ionization in both positive and negative polarity was conducted on Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA) standards, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by freshwater phytoplankton (Scenedesmus obliquus, Euglena mutabilis, and Euglena gracilis). Three-dimensional van Krevelen diagrams expressing various oxygenation states of sulfur molecules and abundance plots of sulfur-containing species were constructed. Orbitrap HRMS analysis of SRFA found a high density of peaks in the lignin region (77 %) and low density of protein material (6.53 %), whereas for PLFA, 25 % of the total peaks were lignin related compared to 56 % of peaks in protein regions, comparable with other HRMS studies. Phytoplankton-derived DOM of S. obliquus, E. mutabilis, and E. gracilis was dominated by protein molecules at respective percentages of 36, 46, and 49 %, and is consistent with previous experiments examining phytoplankton-derived DOM composition. The normalized percentage of SO-containing compounds was determined among the three phytoplankton to be 56 % for Scenedesmus, 54 % for E. mutabilis, and 47 % for E. gracilis, suggesting variation between sulfur content in phytoplankton-derived DOM and differences in metal binding capacities. These results suggest the level of resolution by Orbitrap mass spectrometry is sufficient for preliminary characterization of phytoplankton DOM at an affordable cost relative to other HRMS techniques.																	1618-2642	1618-2650				MAR	2016	408	7					1891	1900		10.1007/s00216-015-9295-9						WOS:000370801900016	26781103

In this study, we investigated the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the photolysis of SAs with sulfapyridine as a reprentative. Results show that excited triplet state DOM ((DOM)-D-3*) is largely responsible for the photodegradation of sulfapyridine. The reaction of (DOM)-D-3* with a substructure model compound of SAs confirmed that sulfapyridine has one reaction site (aniline-N). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed, which indicates that the anionic sulfapyridine has higher (DOM)-D-3* reactivity than that of the neutral form, which was also confirmed by steady state photolytic experiments. In the reaction, electrons of the aniline-N transfer to the carbonyl oxygen atom of (DOM)-D-3* moiety, followed by proton transfer, and leading to the formation of sulfapyridine radicals. The photolytic mechansim of sulfapyridine initiated by (DOM)-D-3* is helpful in understanding the photochemical fate and assessing the ecological risks of SAs in the aquatic environment.

Experimental insights into the importance of aquatic bacterial community composition to the degradation of dissolved organic matter	ISME JOURNAL												Bacteria play a central role in the cycling of carbon, yet our understanding of the relationship between the taxonomic composition and the degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is still poor. In this experimental study, we were able to demonstrate a direct link between community composition and ecosystem functioning in that differently structured aquatic bacterial communities differed in their degradation of terrestrially derived DOM. Although the same amount of carbon was processed, both the temporal pattern of degradation and the compounds degraded differed among communities. We, moreover, uncovered that low-molecular-weight carbon was available to all communities for utilisation, whereas the ability to degrade carbon of greater molecular weight was a trait less widely distributed. Finally, whereas the degradation of either low-or high-molecular-weight carbon was not restricted to a single phylogenetic clade, our results illustrate that bacterial taxa of similar phylogenetic classification differed substantially in their association with the degradation of DOM compounds. Applying techniques that capture the diversity and complexity of both bacterial communities and DOM, our study provides new insight into how the structure of bacterial communities may affect processes of biogeochemical significance.

Dissolved organic matter may consist of a myriad of different fractions and resultant processing pathways. In early January 2011, heavy rainfall occurred across South East Queensland, Australia causing significant catchment inflow into Lake Wivenhoe, which is the largest water supply reservoir for the city of Brisbane, Australia. The horizontal and vertical distributions of dissolved organic matter fractions in the lake during the flood period were investigated and then compared with stratified conditions with no catchment inflows. The results clearly demonstrate a large variation in dissolved organic matter fractions associated with inflow conditions compared with stratified conditions. During inflows, dissolved organic matter concentrations in the reservoir were fivefold lower than during stratified conditions. Within the dissolved organic matter fractions during inflow, the hydrophobic and humic acid fractions were almost half those recorded during the stratified period whilst low molecular weight neutrals were higher during the flood period compared to during the stratified period. Information on dissolved organic matter and the spatial and vertical variations in its constituents' concentrations across the lake can be very useful for catchment and lake management and for selecting appropriate water treatment processes.

Surface concentrations of DOC, DIN, DON and THAA at the nearshore stations were mostly in excess of those found at the offshore sites, indicating either substantial autochthonous production or allochthonous inputs from the Changjiang River. The vertical distributions of DOC, DON and THAA showed similar trends with higher values in the surface layer, whereas the elevated concentrations of DIN were observed in the bottom layer. Major constituents of THAA presented in the study area were glycine, serine, alanine, glutamic add, aspartic acid and valine. The mole percentages of neutral amino acids increased from surface water to bottom water, whereas acidic and hydroxy amino acids decreased with the water depth. Concentrations of DOC and THAA were negatively correlated to the Delta DIN values (the difference between the real concentration and theoretical concentration), respectively, indicating the coupling relation between dissolved organic matter (DOM) remineralization and nutrient regeneration in the water column. The C/N ratios in the water column exhibited different characteristics with elevated values appearing in the surface and bottom layers. Box and whisker plots showed that both degradation index (DI) values and THAA yields displayed a decreasing trend from the surface layer to the bottom layer, implying increasing degradation with the water depth. Our data revealed that glycine and alanine increased in relative abundance with decreasing DI, while tyrosine, valine, phenylalanine and isoleucine increased with increasing DI.

J	Zhang, JH				Zhang, Jinghuan			Influence of Dissolved Organic Matter on Sorption and Desorption of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene onto Wood Char	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												Sorption and desorption of 1, 2, 3-trichlorobenzene (TCB) and 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB) onto wood char prepared from maple wood shavings heated at 500 degrees C were studied in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM), including humic acid (HA), L-malic acid (L-MA), and peptone. Compared to TCB, TeCB exhibited more nonlinear and stronger sorption onto wood char. Nonlinearity of the sorption isotherms increased in the presence of DOM. The presence of HA enhanced the sorption capacity and desorption hysteresis of TCB and TeCB on wood char mainly due to the strong sorption of HA on wood char surface. Moreover, there were positive relations between K-d values of TCB and TeCB and the HA concentration (p < 0.01). In contrast, peptone reduced the sorption capacity and increased the sorption reversibility because of the partition of TCB and TeCB in peptone solution. L-MA at 50-200mg center dot L-1 also leads to a decrease in sorption capacity and irreversibility attributed to solubilization, although the sorbed L-MA on the wood char surface can slightly increase TCB and TeCB sorption. At the same concentration, peptone leads to a higher decrease in TCB sorption than L-MA. Also, negative correlations were found between K-d values of TCB and TeCB and the L-MA and peptone concentration (p < 0.01). Our results may help to understand the different impacts of DOM on the transport and fate of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons in aquatic environments polluted with chars.																	1532-0383	1549-7887				FEB 17	2016	25	2					210	222		10.1080/15320383.2016.1113398						WOS:000373910400008

The method requires solid-phase extraction (SPE) extraction of only small volumes of water samples, here using poly(styrenedivinylbenzene)-based extraction cartridges (Varian PPL). The extracted and concentrated DOM was quantified using reversed-phase high-performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC), with a water/methanol (5:5) mobile phase and hexane/ethyl acetate (3:7) stationary phase. The critical chromatographic parameters were optimised, applying a revolution speed of 1900 rpm and a flow-rate of 1 mL min(-1). Under these conditions, 50 mu L of extracted DOM solution could be injected and quantified using calibration against a reference natural dissolved material (Suwannee River), based upon UV absorbance at 254 nm and ELSD detection. Both detection methods provided excellent linearity (R-2 > 0.995) for DOM across the concentration ranges of interest, with limits of detection of 4 mu g ml(-1) and 7 mu g ml(-1) for ELSD and UV absorbance, respectively. The method was validated for peak area precision (<5%), and accuracy and recovery based upon spiking seawater samples prior to extraction, together with DOM solutions post-extraction (>95% recovery). The developed method was applied to the determination of the concentration of DOM in seawater, based upon initial sample volumes as small as 20 mL. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For each DOM sample, the five size fractions were determined by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detector (SEC-OCD). For 2-year long monthly monitoring, bio-polymers (BP), humic substances (HS), building blocks (BB), low molecular-weight (LMW) neutrals, and LMW acids displayed the median values of 264, 1884, 1070, 1090, and 11 mu g-C L-1, respectively, accounting for 6.2%, 41.7%, 24.5%, 26.4%, and 0.4% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The dominant presence of HS indicated that terrestrial input played important roles in DOM composition of the freshwater ecosystem, which contrasted with coastal wetlands in other reports. Both seasonal and periodic patterns in the variations were found only for HS and BB among the size fractions. It was also notable that the sources of HS were seasonally shifted from aquagenic origin in winter to pedogenic origin in summer. The correlations among the size fractions revealed that BB and LMW neutrals might be degradation products from HS and humic-like substances (HS + BB), respectively, while LMW acids, from LMW neutrals. Principle component analysis revealed that the humic-like substances and the aromaticity of DOM were associated with temperature, chlorophyll a, phosphorous, and rainfall, whereas the other fractions and the molecular weight of HS were primarily affected by solar irradiation. Significant correlations between DOM composition and some biotic factors further suggested that DOM may even affect the biological communities, which provides an insight into the potential coupling effects of biotic and abiotic factors on DOM molecular composition in freshwater wetlands.

J	Hawkes, JA; Hansen, CT; Goldhammer, T; Bach, W; Dittmar, T				Hawkes, Jeffrey A.; Hansen, Christian T.; Goldhammer, Tobias; Bach, Wolfgang; Dittmar, Thorsten			Molecular alteration of marine dissolved organic matter under experimental hydrothermal conditions	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a large (660 Pg) pool of reduced carbon that is subject to thermal alteration in hydrothermal systems and sedimentary basins. In natural high-temperature hydrothermal systems, DOM is almost completely removed, but the mechanism and temperature dependence of this removal have not been studied to date. We investigated molecular-level changes to DOM that was solid-phase extracted (SPE-DOM) from the deep ocean of the North Pacific Ocean. This complex molecular mixture was experimentally exposed to temperatures between 100 and 380 degrees C over the course of two weeks in artificial seawater, and was then characterised on a molecular level via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Almost 93% of SPE-DOM was removed by the treatment at 380 degrees C, and this removal was accompanied by a consistent pattern of SPE-DOM alteration across the temperatures studied. Higher molecular weight and more oxygen rich compounds were preferentially removed, suggesting that decarboxylation and dehydration of carboxylic acid and alcohol groups are the most rapid degradation mechanisms. Nitrogen containing compounds followed the same overall trends as those containing just C, H and O up to 300 degrees C. Above this temperature, the most highly altered samples contained very little of the original character of marine DOM, instead being mainly composed of very low intensity N- and S-containing molecules with a high H/C ratio (>1.5). Our results suggest that abiotic hydrothermal alteration of SPE-DOM may already occur at temperatures above 68 degrees C. Our experiments were conducted without a sedimentary or mineral phase, and demonstrate that profound molecular alteration and almost complete removal of marine SPE-DOM requires nothing more than heating in a seawater matrix.

J	Wang, XC; Chen, H; Lei, K; Sun, Z				Wang, Xuechun; Chen, Hao; Lei, Kun; Sun, Zhong			Long-term effect of a simple storage protocol on fluorescence fingerprint of dissolved organic matter	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Fitting a pre-established region-specific Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model to new dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples has become a popular approach in DOM studies. A key step during the development of the pre-established model is to identify the fluorescence fingerprint, i. e. the number of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components as well as their excitation and emission spectral features. In practice the samples to use for model development may not be measured immediately after sampling and will instead be stored for a relatively long time, thus raising the question whether the storage would change the intrinsic fingerprints. In this study, two PARAFAC models were separately developed and validated for the same set of surface water DOM samples from an estuary and its river, immediately after sampling and after 9-month storage respectively. The fingerprint did not change after storage, regardless of the change of the intensity of some components. The findings in this study highlighted that DOM samples stored using a simple protocol (i. e. filtration to 0.45 mu m pore size without any preservatives and placed at 4 degrees C in the dark under airtight conditions) for a few months would not change fluorescence fingerprints for PARAFAC and broaden our understanding of the application of PARAFAC to DOM studies.																	1606-9749					FEB	2016	16	1					44	51		10.2166/ws.2015.111						WOS:000374303800006

Catchment influence on nitrate and dissolved organic matter in Alaskan streams across a latitudinal gradient	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Spatial patterns in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles of high-latitude catchments have been linked to climate and permafrost and used to infer potential changes in biogeochemical cycles under climate warming. However, inconsistent spatial patterns across regions indicate that factors in addition to permafrost and regional climate may shape responses of C and N cycles to climate change. We hypothesized that physical attributes of catchments modify responses of C and N cycles to climate and permafrost. We measured dissolved organic C (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations, and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in 21 streams spanning boreal to arctic Alaska, and assessed permafrost, topography, and attributes of soils and vegetation as predictors of stream chemistry. Multiple regression analyses indicated that catchment slope is a primary driver, with lower DOC and higher NO3- concentration in streams draining steeper catchments, respectively. Depth of the active layer explained additional variation in concentration of DOC and NO3-. Vegetation type explained regional variation in concentration and composition of DOM, which was characterized by optical methods. Composition of DOM was further correlated with attributes of soils, including moisture, temperature, and thickness of the organic layer. Regional patterns of DOC and NO3- concentrations in boreal to arctic Alaska were driven primarily by catchment topography and modified by permafrost, whereas composition of DOM was driven by attributes of soils and vegetation, suggesting that predicting changes to C and N cycling from permafrost-influenced regions should consider catchment setting in addition to dynamics of climate and permafrost.

Two soil-derived, humic-like (C1 and C2) and three protein-like fluorescence components (C3, C4, and C5) were identified. During high discharges, river water DOM had higher values of DOC concentration, percent humic fluorescence, and humification index, but lower values of fluorescence index and percent protein fluorescence than found at base flow, suggesting that flow paths shifted to shallower depths flushing out topsoil organic matter. Loading of DOC and soil-derived humic fluorescence were driven largely by discharge, with values over 10 times higher during high discharges than at base flow. Furthermore, both C-13-DOC and C1 at high flows positively correlated with %agricultural lands within 1km river buffers, demonstrating that near-river agricultural activities enhanced storm export of soil DOM. At base flow, C4 positively correlated with %agricultural lands, showing stimulation of aquatic bacterial carbon production as a result of elevated nutrient inputs from agricultural lands. Percent contributions of humic fluorescence in groundwater varied with well depths in shallow wells, but this pattern was not observed for deeper groundwater, suggesting that humic DOM could serve as a water source tracer indicating deeper aquifers were isolated from river water and shallow groundwater. Together, our data demonstrate that hydrology and land use controlled the sources and amount of riverine DOM in this large agricultural basin and that regulating storm runoff and near-river agricultural activities should be incorporated in ecosystem-based management of water resources.

Alteration of the molecular-size-distribution of Boom Clay dissolved organic matter induced by Na+ and Ca2+	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In porous media, the extent of dissolved organic matter (DOM)-facilitated contaminant transport depends on the concentration, conformation and the size of the dissolved organic species. Yet, these parameters are highly sensitive to the ionic strength (IS) and the ionic composition of the solution. Boom Clay (BC) which is considered in Belgium as a potential host rock for nuclear waste disposal contains polydisperse DOM that might associate with radionuclide and increase their mobility. To get more insight into the effect of IS on DOM structure and into its impact on the solid/solution partitioning of OM in BC is essential for safety assessment. In a first set, we investigated the influence of NaCl and CaCl2 content on the concentration, the MW distribution and UV spectral parameters of DOM collected from BC. With an increase in IS two main mechanisms were identified: a compaction and/or dissociation of the DOM molecules and an aggregation. We showed that the sensitivity of the DOM species to these two mechanisms was size/MW dependent and that the presence of Ca2+ promotes the aggregation. The largest species are more prone to aggregation which at the extreme leads to their transfer to particulate OM. On the contrary, small DOM species hardly aggregate but compact or dissociate with an increase of IS. These observations were confirmed in the second experimental set in which we followed the release of DOM from BC rock in various electrolytes. The increase of IS and multivalent cations content reduces the amount, the degree of aromaticity and the MW of DOM released from BC which limit the extent of DOM-facilitated contaminant transport in BC.

However, the validation of robust PARAFAC models using split-half analysis requires an oft unrealistically large number (hundreds to thousands) of excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), and models with too few components may not adequately describe differences between DOM. This study used self-organizing maps (SOM) and comparing changes in residuals with the effects of adding components to estimate the number of PARAFAC components in DOM from two data sets: MS (110 EEMs from nine leaf leachates and headwaters) and LR (64 EEMs from the Lena River). Clustering by SOM demonstrated that peaks clearly persisted in model residuals after validation by split-half analysis. Plotting the changes to residuals was an effective method for visualizing the removal of fluorophore-like fluorescence caused by increasing the number of PARAFAC components. Extracting additional PARAFAC components via residuals analysis increased the proportion of correctly identified size-fractionated leaf leachates from 56.0 +/- 0.8 to 75.2 +/- 0.9%, and from 51.7 +/- 1.4 to 92.9 +/- 0.0% for whole leachates. Model overfitting was assessed by considering the correlations between components, and their distributions amongst samples. Advanced residuals analysis improved the ability of PARAFAC to resolve the variation in DOM fluorescence, and presents an enhanced validation approach for assessing the number of components that can be used to supplement the potentially misleading results of split-half analysis.																	0003-7028	1943-3530				FEB	2016	70	2					334	346		10.1177/0003702815620546						WOS:000370921200009	26783366

However, little information on the behavior of dissolved organic matter in the process was available. In this study, a pilot scale O-3-BAF was set up to treat the biologically treated textile wastewater, and both fluorescent excitation-emission-matrix (EEM) and HPLC with multi-excitation/emission fluorescence scan were applied to study the removal characterization of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM). The results showed that with the improvement of biodegradability by ozonation, the combination of ozonation and BAF could low the COD of the effluent below 50 mg/L, meeting the Chinese Discharge Standard. EEM analysis showed that the removal of the triple-excitation peaks at Em460 was the dominant mechanism of high removal efficiency of color and UV254 during ozonation process. In addition, during the ozonation process, the fluorescent DOM species were decomposed in the order of humic substances with Em at 460 nm (HS-Em460-Ex3), the hydrophobic aniline-like species, humic substances with Em at 430 nm (HS-Em430-Ex2) and the hydrophilic aniline-like species. This study provided better understanding on the decoloration mechanism of ozonation and helps to build automatic optimization systems in advanced treatment of textile wastewater.

Phototransformation of pesticides in prairie potholes: effect of dissolved organic matter in triplet-induced oxidation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Photochemical reactions involving a variety of photosensitizers contribute to the abiotic transformation of pesticides in prairie pothole lakes (PPLs). Despite the fact that triplet excited state dissolved organic matter (DOM) enhances phototransformation of pesticides by acting as a photosensitizer, it may also decrease the overall phototransformation rate through various mechanisms. In this study, the effect of DOM on the phototransformation of four commonly applied pesticides in four different PPL waters was investigated under simulated sunlight using photoexcited benzophenone-4-carboxylate as the oxidant with DOM serving as an anti-oxidant. For atrazine and mesotrione, a decrease in phototransformation rates was observed, while phototransformations of metolachlor and isoproturon were not affected by DOM inhibition. Phototransformation rates and the extent of inhibition/enhancement by DOM varied spatially and temporally across the wetlands studied. Characterization of DOM from the sites and different seasons suggested that the DOM type and variations in the DOM structure are important factors controlling phototransformation rates of pesticides in PPLs.																	2050-7887	2050-7895				FEB	2016	18	2					237	245		10.1039/c5em00374a						WOS:000370690900008	26745785	
J	Xu, HC; Guo, LD; Jiang, HL				Xu, Huacheng; Guo, Laodong; Jiang, Helong			Depth-dependent variations of sedimentary dissolved organic matter composition in a eutrophic lake: Implications for lake restoration	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a significant role in regulating nutrients and carbon cycling and the reactivity of trace metals and other contaminants in the environment. However, the environmental/ecological role of sedimentary DOM is highly dependent on organic composition. In this study, fluorescence excitation emission matrix-parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis, two dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS), and ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) were applied to investigate the depth-dependent variations of sediment-leached DOM components in a eutrophic lake. Results of EEM-PARAFAC and 2D COS showed that fluorescent humic-like component was preferentially degraded microbially over fulvic-like component at greater sediment depths, and the relative abundance of non-fluorescent components decreased with increasing depth, leaving the removal rate of carbohydrates > lignins. The predominant sedimentary DOM components derived from FT-ICR-MS were lipids (>50%), followed by lignins (similar to 15%) and proteins (similar to 15%). The relative abundance of carbohydrates, lignins, and condensed aromatics decreased significantly at greater depths, whereas that of lipids increased in general with depth. There existed a significant negative correlation between the short-range ordered (SRO) minerals and the total dissolved organic carbon concentration or the relative contents of lignins and condensed aromatics (p < 0.05), suggesting that SRO mineral sorption plays a significant role in controlling the composition heterogeneity and releasing of DOM in lake sediments. Higher metal binding potential observed for DOM at deeper sediment depth (e.g., 25-30 cm) supported the ecological safety of sediment dredging technique from the viewpoint of heavy metal de-toxicity.

However, the constituents and structures of DOM change continuously as DOM is subjected to microbial decomposition and photodegradation at natural field scales. Thus, this study was designed to explore the effects of chemical changes of DOM on heavy metal sorption onto farmland soil in natural degradation. Fresh DOM (FDOM) and degraded DOM (DDOM) both were extracted from the straw of maize which was extensively planted in Loess Plateau, China. The characteristics of DOM were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra, UV-visible spectra (UV-vis), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular weight analysis. Farmland loess soil in Loess Plateau and heavy metal Cu(II) which can easily form a complex with DOM in soil were employed to investigate the effects of DOM dynamic changes on Cu(II) sorption onto loess through batch tests. Compared with FDOM, DDOM changed significantly in composition including oxygen content, functional group species, aromatic properties, and molecular weight distribution. Oxygen content, aromaticity, and low-molecular-weight fraction (< 3 kDa) decreased while aromatic substitution and high-molecular-weight fraction (> 10 kDa) increased for DDOM. For these changes, the effects of FDOM and DDOM on heavy metal Cu(II) sorption onto loess were significantly different due to DOM-Cu(II) binding ability varied with FDOM degradation. FDOM promoted Cu(II) sorption onto loess at Cu(II) concentration below 400 mg l(-1) while inhibited above 400 mg l(-1), but DDOM always showed inhibition effects on Cu(II) sorption onto loess. Moreover, both the promotion and inhibition effects depended mainly on the initial concentrations and pH values of FDOM and DDOM. The results of the present study demonstrate that chemical characteristics of FDOM and DDOM are greatly diverse in components, functional group species, molecular weight distribution, etc. although they are from the same source. The apparent differences can explain their distinct effects on copper sorption onto loess soil. Hence, future researches are supposed to focus on the dynamic changes of DOMs when evaluating their influence on heavy metals environmental behaviors under actual conditions.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				FEB	2016	16	2					327	338		10.1007/s11368-015-1226-z						WOS:000368686500001

Results showed that the bulk DOM comprised fulvic-, humic-, tryptophanand tyrosine-like substances, as well as component C1, whose composition and origin was unidentified. Landfill process increased the content of component C1, fulvic-and humic-like matter. The HON fractions comprised primarily component C1 and tyrosine-like matter. The HOA, HOB and HIM fractions isolated from the young leachates consisted mainly of tryptophan-and tyrosine-like substances. As to the intermediate and old leachates, the HOA and HOB fractions comprised mainly component C1, while the HIM comprised mainly fulvic-like matter. The HIM showed the most resistant against biodegradation among the four fractions, and was the main component of leachate treatment. Advanced oxidation and/or membrane treatment are recommended to remove the HIM fraction due to its hydrophilic and stable characteristics.(c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine the optimal wavelength derived from CDOM fluorescence as an indicator of point-source contamination in drinking waters, a combination of field campaigns in Lake Qiandao and a laboratory wastewater addition experiment was used. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis identified six components, including three humic-like, two tryptophan-like, and one tyrosine-like component. All metrics showed strong correlation with wastewater addition (r(2) > 0.90, p < 0.0001). Both the field campaigns and the laboratory contamination experiment revealed that CDOM fluorescence at 275/342 nm was the most responsive wavelength to the point-source contamination in the lake. Our results suggest that pollutants in Lake Qiandao had the highest concentrations in the river mouths of upstream inflow tributaries and the single wavelength at 275/342 nm may be adapted for online or in situ fluorescence measurements as an early warning of contamination events. This study demonstrates the potential utility of CDOM fluorescence to monitor water quality in surface drinking water sources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Exposure to sunlight at 2.7 x 10(5) J m(-2) resulted in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reductions of 22.1-36.5% in ice. The naturally occurring DOM had higher photodegradation potentials than the wastewater-derived DOM in ice. Ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing compounds in DOM, regardless of DOM origin, had much higher photodegradation potentials than gross DOC in ice. The susceptibility of UV-absorbing compounds with natural origin to sunlight exposure in ice was higher than those derived from wastewater. Trihalomethane (THM) precursors were more susceptible to photochemical reactions than gross DOC and haloacetic acid (HAA) precursors in ice. THM precursors in naturally occurring DOM were more photoreactive than those in wastewater-derived DOM in ice, while the photoreactivity of HAA precursors in ice was independent of DOM origin. In ice, the photoreactivity of humic-like fluorescent materials, regardless of DOM origin, was higher than that of gross DOC and protein-like fluorescent materials. DOC reductions caused by sunlight irradiation were found to be negatively correlated to DOC levels, and positively correlated to the aromaticity of DOM. The photodegradation of both wastewater-derived and naturally occurring DOM in ice was significantly facilitated at both acid and alkaline pH, as compared to neutral pH. The photodegradation of DOM in ice, regardless of the origin, was facilitated by nitrate ion (NO3-), nitrite ion (NO2-), ferric ion (Fe3+) and ferrous ion (Fe2+), and on the other hand, was inhibited by chloridion ion (Cl-) and copper ion (Cu2+).

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Biological activity in lakes is strongly influenced by hydrodynamic conditions, not least turbulence intensity; which increases the encounter rate between plankter and nutrient patches. To investigate whether enhanced turbulence in shallow and eutrophic lakes may result in elevated biological production of autochthonous chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), a combination of field campaigns and mesocosm experiments was used. Parallel factor analysis identified seven components: four protein-like, one microbial humic-like and two terrestrial humic-like components. During our field campaigns, elevated production of autochthonous CDOM was recorded in open water with higher wind speed and wave height than in inner bays, implying that elevated turbulence resulted in increased production of autochthonous CDOM. Confirming the field campaign results, in the mesocosm experiment enhanced turbulence resulted in a remarkably higher microbial humic-like Cl and tryptophan-like C3 (p <0.01), indicating that higher turbulence may have elevated the production of autochthonous CDOM. This is consistent with the significantly higher mean concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the enhanced phytoplanktonic alkaline phosphatase activity (PAPA) recorded in the experimental turbulence groups than in the,control group (p < 0.05). The C:N ratio (from 334 to 25.72 with a mean of 13.13 +/- 4.08) for the mesocosm CDOM samples further suggested their probable autochthonous origin. Our results have implications for the understanding of CDOM cycling in shallow aquatic ecosystems influenced by wind-induced waves, in which the enhanced turbulence associated with extreme weather conditions may be further stimulated by the predicted global climate change.

Invasive alien species may have far-reaching effects on the host environment that need to be explored. In this study, we compared particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) production from two common Patagonian wetland plants, one native (Eleocharis pachycarpa) and one exotic (Potentilla anserina), under different light conditions (exposed or not to ultraviolet radiation (UVR+, UVR-) and darkness). Our results indicated that when exposed to UVR both macrophytes differed in their POM production and DOM release: while in E. pachycarpa we observed an increase in the POM production P. anserina released significantly higher amount of DOM. The DOM produced by the exotic species showed lower photoreactivity, and had more colour than that produced by the native E. pachycarpa. The invasion by macrophytes may produce changes in the stoichiometric balance and ecological relationships that could modify the characteristics of wetland food web.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2016	766	1					29	42		10.1007/s10750-015-2434-7						WOS:000367196900003

The investigated operating parameters based on minimum residual color were coagulant type, dose, electrodes materials, filtering velocity, and current intensity. The electroflotation-filtration reactor was operated in the vertical continuous flow mode. The best coagulant was polymerization ferric chloride (PFC). Aluminum electrodes were selected as anodes by comparison experiments. The results indicated that the increase in filtering velocity resulted in decrease in color removal and shorter standard processing time with the aluminum electrode. When the current was below a certain value, increasing current intensity shortened the time to reach the minimum residual color and achieved higher color removal. The interaction between the factors and their optimum levels for minimum residual was determined using response surface methodology. The optimum operation conditions were the filtering velocity of 5.00m/h, the PFC dosage of 36.07mg/L, and current intensity of 2.00 A with aluminum electrode, and the minimum residual color of 4.52 Pt-Co units could be obtained.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN 8	2016	57	2					754	764		10.1080/19443994.2015.1084532						WOS:000366662900028		
J	Liu, C; Croue, JP				Liu, Chao; Croue, Jean-Philippe			Formation of Bromate and Halogenated Disinfection Byproducts during Chlorination of Bromide-Containing Waters in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter and CuO	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Previous studies showed that significant bromate (BrO3-) can be formed via the CuO-catalyzed disproportiona-tion of hypobromous acid (HOBO pathway. In this study, the influence of CuO on the formation of BrO3- and halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) (e.g., trihalomethanes, THMs and haloacetic acids, HAAs) during chlorination of six dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolates was investigated. Only in the presence of slow reacting DOM (from treated Colorado River water, i.e., CRW-BF-HPO), significant BrO3- formation is observed, which competes with bromination of DOM (i.e., THM and HAA formation). Reactions between HOBr and 12 model compounds in the presence of CuO indicates that CuO-catalyzed HOBr disproportionation is completely inhibited by fast reacting phenols, while it predominates in the presence of practically unreactive compounds (acetone, butanol, propionic, and butyric acids). In the presence of slow reacting di- and tricarboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic, succinic, and citric acids), BrO3- formation varies, depending on its competition with bromoform and dibromoacetic acid formation (i.e., brornination pathway). The latter pathway can be enhanced by CuO due to the activation of HOBr. Therefore, increasing CuO dose (0-0.2 g L-1) in a reaction system containing chlorine, bromide, and CRW-BF-HPO enhances the formation of BrO3-, total THMs and HAAs. Factors including pH and initial reactant concentrations influence the DBP formation. These novel findings have implications for elevated DBP formation during transportation of chlorinated waters in copper-containing distribution systems.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 5	2016	50	1					135	144		10.1021/acs.est.5b03266						WOS:000367866300016	26630351

For this analysis we used a database containing 556 absorption spectra measured in 2006-2009 in different regions of the Baltic Sea (open and coastal waters, the Gulf of Gdansk and the Pomeranian Bay), at river mouths, in the Szczecin Lagoon and also in three lakes in Pomerania (Poland) - Obleskie, Lebsko and Chotkowskie. The variability range of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 400 nm, a(CDOM)(400), lay within 0.15-8.85m(-1). The variability in a(CDOM)(lambda)was parameterized with respect to the variability over 3 orders of magnitude in the chlorophyll a concentration Chl a (0.7-119 mg m(-3)). The chlorophyll a concentration and a(CDOM)(400) were correlated, and a statistically significant, nonlinear empirical relationship between these parameters was derived (R-2 = 0.83). On the basis of the covariance between these parameters, we derived two empirical mathematical models that enabled us to design the CDOM absorption coefficient dynamics in natural waters and reconstruct the complete CDOM absorption spectrum in the UV and visible spectral domains. The input variable in the first model was the chlorophyll a concentration, and in the second one it was a CDOM(400). Both models were fitted to a power function, and a second-order polynomial function was used as the exponent. Regression coefficients for these formulas were determined for wavelengths from 240 to 700 nm at 5 nm intervals. Both approximations reflected the real shape of the absorption spectra with a low level of uncertainty. Comparison of these approximations with other models of light absorption by CDOM demonstrated that our parameterizations were superior (bias from -1.45 to 62 %, RSME from 22 to 220 %) for estimating CDOM absorption in the optically complex waters of the Baltic Sea and Pomeranian lakes.																	1812-0784						2016	12	4					1013	1032		10.5194/os-12-1013-2016						WOS:000383696300004		
J	McNeill, K; Canonica, S				McNeill, Kristopher; Canonica, Silvio			Triplet state dissolved organic matter in aquatic photochemistry: reaction mechanisms, substrate scope, and photophysical properties	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Excited triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((CDOM)-C-3*) play a major role among the reactive intermediates produced upon absorption of sunlight by surface waters. After more than two decades of research on the aquatic photochemistry of (CDOM)-C-3*, the need for improving the knowledge about the photophysical and photochemical properties of these elusive reactive species remains considerable. This critical review examines the efforts to date to characterize (CDOM)-C-3*. Information on (CDOM)-C-3* relies mainly on the use of probe compounds because of the difficulties associated with directly observing (CDOM)-C-3* using transient spectroscopic methods. Singlet molecular oxygen (O-1(2)), which is a product of the reaction between (CDOM)-C-3* and dissolved oxygen, is probably the simplest indicator that can be used to estimate steady-state concentrations of (CDOM)-C-3*. There are two major modes of reaction of (CDOM)-C-3* with substrates, namely triplet energy transfer or oxidation (via electron transfer, proton-coupled electron transfer or related mechanisms). Organic molecules, including several environmental contaminants, that are susceptible to degradation by these two different reaction modes are reviewed. It is proposed that through the use of appropriate sets of probe compounds and model photosensitizers an improved estimation of the distribution of triplet energies and one-electron reduction potentials of (CDOM)-C-3* can be achieved.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2016	18	11					1381	1399		10.1039/c6em00408c						WOS:000388469600002	27722628

It is important to investigate the removal efficiency of DOM by coagulation. Polyaluminum chloride a widely used coagulant is applied in the treatment of DOM derived from Minzhu Lake in Chongqing of China. Based on the analysis of dissolved organic carbon, UV254, specific ultraviolet absorbance, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy, the results indicate that the small proportion of DOM, such as aromatic-like organic substances, is removed with algae and other colloid particles via coagulation, but most of DOM, such as he tryptophan-like and fulvic-like organic substances, is remained in the treated water. Co-flocculation, bridging, adsorption, and entrapment would be the main removal mechanisms of DOM. DOM removal will be slightly improved through optimizing pH of surface water and using a composite coagulant.																	1944-3994	1944-3986					2016	57	53					25337	25344		10.1080/19443994.2016.1152510						WOS:000385674500002

In this study, we investigated the hydrodynamic processes, photodegradation and biodegradation of DOM at the Yangtze River plume in the East China Sea through analyzing water quality and optical properties of DOM. Surface water samples were collected to examine water quality and fluorescence properties of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). The results indicated that dilution was the key factor in the multiple processes, and the mixing process gradually increased from nearshore to offshore in coastal water. Four components of FDOM representing humic-like substances (C1 & C4) and protein-like substances (C2 & C3) were identified, and all components showed nearly conservative behaviors. Protein-like substances were more mutable compared to humic-like substances. The photodegradation of humic-like substances caused brown algae blooms to some extent. The molecular weight of humic substances gradually decreased along the mixing process. FDOM in the plume zone was both of terrigenous and autochthonous origins, and the characteristic of terrigenous origin was obvious compared to that of autochthonous origin.

This study investigated the effects of multi-pretreatments, including coagulation, adsorption, and pre-oxidation, of a WWTP secondary effluent via adding Al-2(SO4)(3)/diatomite composite, FeCl3, GAC, and O-3 to control DOM fouling UF membrane. Results showed the membrane fluxes increased by 18.1, 8.1, 5.3, and 0.1% and membrane resistances decreased by 58.9, 28.9, 17.8, and 2.2%, when the optimal adding dosages of Al-2(SO4)(3)/diatomite composite, FeCl3, GAC, and O-3 were 400, 80, 80, and 6mgL(-1), respectively. The tests of a series of UF membranes with different pore sizes demonstrated that DOM of 10,000-30,000Dalton MW in the secondary effluent was dramatically reduced by adding Al-2(SO4)(3)/diatomite composite, FeCl3, and GAC. This fractionation was mainly protein-like substances characterized by 3DEEM fluorescence spectroscopy. Additionally, adding Al-2(SO4)(3)/diatomite composite was available for removing humic acid-like substances simultaneously. Although O-3 addition effectively oxidized protein-like and humic acid-like substances, it could induce the increase in DOM of <4,000Dalton MW up to 80.1% and triggered the UF membrane fouling. Combination of MW distribution, SEM and 3DEEM, the DOM fractionation of <6,000Dalton MW, mainly humic acid-like substances, easily caused UF membrane fouling. Consequently, compared with adsorption and pre-oxidation, the coagulation of Al-2(SO4)(3)/diatomite composite, the first time used for the pretreatment of DOM, was proved to be the best additive for controlling UF membrane fouling.																	1944-3994	1944-3986					2016	57	47					22223	22231		10.1080/19443994.2015.1130654						WOS:000384061500004

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the environmental photochemical transformation of organic pollutants. However, the effects of DOM on the photolysis kinetics and dioxin formation of HO-PXDEs are still not fully understood. Herein, the effects of Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) on the phototransformation of 2'-HO-2,4,4'-trichlorodiphenyl ether (triclosan) and 2'-HO-2,4,4'-tribromodiphenyl ether (2'-HO-BDE-28) were investigated in artificial estuarine water (AEW). The results showed that although SRNOM induced indirect photolysis of triclosan and 2'-HO-BDE-28, it decreased the observed photolytic rate constants due to light screening, static quenching and dynamic quenching effects. The above effects were quantified firstly. Direct photolysis is more important than indirect photolysis in the transformation of the target compounds and the production of dioxins. SRNOM increased the dioxin yields of the two HO-PXDEs. It was also found that SRNOM decreased the formation rate constant (kp) of 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,8-DCDD) from triclosan and showed no obvious influence on the kp of 2,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,8-DBDD) from 2'-HO-BDE-28. SRNOM showed no obvious influence on the degradation of 2,8-DCDD, while it increased the degradation rate constant of 2,8-DBDD. The promoting effect on the degradation of 2,8-DBDD was attributed to the formation of chloride radicals with the concurrence of SRNOM and Cl- in AEW. This study revealed the roles of SRNOM in the photochemical transformation of HO-PXDEs and the photochemical formation and degradation of dioxins, which is important for elucidating the transformation fate of HO-PXDEs in aquatic environments.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2016	18	9					1177	1184		10.1039/c6em00122j						WOS:000384252500006	27383795

Batch studies were conducted with quinone-reducing bacteria to assess the influences of sodium formate (NaFc), electron shuttling compounds (DOM) and the Fe(III) on Cr(VI) reduction rates as these chemical species are likely to be present in the environment during in situ bioremediation. Results indicated that the concentration of sodium formate and anthraquinone-2-sodium sulfonate (AQS) had apparently an effect on Cr(VI) reduction. The fastest decrease in rate for incubation supplemented with 5 mM sodium formate and 0.8 mM AQS showed that Fe(III)/DOM significantly promoted the reduction of Cr(VI). Presumably due to the presence of more easily utilizable sodium formate, DOM and Fe(III) have indirect Cr(VI) reduction capability. The coexisting cycles of Fe(II)/Fe(III) and DOM(ox)/DOM(red) exhibited a higher redox function than the individual cycle, and their abiotic coupling action can significantly enhance Cr(VI) reduction by quinone-reducing bacteria.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2016	18	9					1185	1192		10.1039/c6em00229c						WOS:000384252500007	27421071

Over the course of a full year, fluorescence, absorbance and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were characterised in Bigelow Brook, a forested headwater stream in Massachusetts, USA. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified a four-component model to describe observed DOM fluorescence (C1-C4). Component C2 exhibited the characteristics of a more humic-like fluorophore, with a potentially more reduced redox state and increased with discharge, whereas more fulvic-like (C1) and protein-like (C3, C4) fluorophores decreased. Under both dark and light-exposed conditions, percentage bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (% BDOC) increased with discharge (R-2 = 0.37 and R-2 = 0.56). C2 and specific absorptivity (SUVA) were reduced following BDOC incubations, whereas C1, C3 and C4 increased. These changes to DOM characteristics with increasing discharge were observed under both baseflow and stormflow conditions, indicating that with rising watertable, loading from a large riparian or hyporheic pool of organic matter is likely occurring. Other headwater streams, where loading is controlled by hillslope processes, are likely to exhibit a similar pattern of increasing export of more humic and bioavailable DOM during hydrologic events.

Transport and transformation of dissolved organic matter in the Neuse River estuarine system, NC, USA, following Hurricane Irene (2011)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Rivers are major conduits for the transport of allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the ocean in coupled land-coastal systems. DOM can regulate biogeochemical processes and affect water quality, depending on the concentration and quality of DOM. By using spectral parameters calculated from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, we examined the input and change in the amount and quality of DOM in surface waters of the lower Neuse River and upper-middle regions of the Neuse Estuary following a major rainfall (30 cm in 1 day) associated with Hurricane Irene (2011). CDOM and DOC nearly tripled in the 3 days following the storm. Although a strong linear relationship was observed between DOC and CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm (R-2 = 0.85), a higher fraction of non-chromophoric DOC to CDOM was observed during the rising river discharge. The spectral slope at 275-295 nm and the slope ratio (275-295 : 350-400 nm) indicated a shift from higher to lower molecular-weight DOM as it transited through the estuary, probably as a result of photodegradation. The present study demonstrated the utility of using CDOM spectral parameters for examining the flux and transformation of DOM in coastal waters following major rain events.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2016	67	9			SI		1313	1325		10.1071/MF15352						WOS:000383167900005

We sampled water from different locations in the Negro, Madeira/Jamari and Tapajos River areas to characterize the molecular DOM composition and distribution. Ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) combined with excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed a large proportion of ubiquitous DOM but also unique area-specific molecular signatures. Unique to the DOM of the Rio Negro area was the large abundance of high molecular weight, diverse hydrogen-deficient and highly oxidized molecular ions deviating from known lignin or tannin compositions, indicating substantial oxidative processing of these ultimately plant-derived polyphenols indicative of these black waters. In contrast, unique signatures in the Madeira/Jamari area were defined by presumably labile sulfur-and nitrogen-containing molecules in this white water river system. Waters from the Tapajos main stem did not show any substantial unique molecular signatures relative to those present in the Rio Madeira and Rio Negro, which implied a lower organic molecular complexity in this clear water tributary, even after mixing with the main stem of the Amazon River. Beside ubiquitous DOM at average H / C and O / C elemental ratios, a distinct and significant unique DOM pool prevailed in the black, white and clear water areas that were also highly correlated with EEM-PARAFAC components and define the frameworks for primary production and other aspects of aquatic life.

It is generally accepted that extraction by SPE is not quantitative with respect to carbon concentration. However, little information is available on the selectivity of different SPE sorbents and the resulting effect for the acquired DOM mass spectra. Freshwater samples were extracted by the widely used PPL, HLB and C18 sorbents and the molecular composition and size distribution of the DOM in the extracts and in the permeates was compared to the original sample. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recoveries ranged between 20% and 65% for the three tested SPE sorbents. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to organic carbon detection (SEC-OCD) revealed that limited recovery by PPL and HLB was primarily due to incomplete elution of a fraction of apparent high molecular weight from the solid phase. In contrast, incomplete retention on the solid phase, mainly observed for the C18 cartridge, was attributed to a fraction of low molecular weight. The FT-ICR mass spectra of the original sample and the SPE extracts did not differ significantly in their molecular weight distribution, but they showed sorbent specific differences in the degree of oxygenation and saturation. We concluded that the selective enrichment of freshwater DOM by SPE is less critical for subsequent FT-ICR MS analysis, because those fractions that are not sufficiently recovered have comparatively small effects on the mass spectra. This was confirmed by the extraction of model compounds, showing that very polar and small molecules are poorly extracted, but also have a low response in ESI-MS. Of the three tested SPE cartridges the PPL material offered the best properties for DOM enrichment for subsequent FT-ICR MS analysis as it minimizes too strong and too weak DOM-sorbent interactions.

The fluorescence spectra allowed determination of proteins using two excitation wavelengths for tyrosine and tryptophan. Fulvic acid was determined using visible and ultraviolet excitation. The fluorescence intensities decreased with aeration but increased in the absence of aeration. However, the fluorescence of fulvic acid increased in aerated and nonaerated samples. The fluorescence of the shorter excitation wavelengths for tyrosine and tryptophan was linear with ammonia concentration under intermittent aeration. When the concentration of dissolved oxygen was 6.5 mg l(-1), the correlation coefficients were 0.9863 and 0.9822. This study shows that ammonia may be rapidly determined in water by measurement of the fluorescence at the shorter excitation wavelengths of tyrosine and tryptophan.																	0003-2719	1532-236X					2016	49	12					1874	1883		10.1080/00032719.2015.1123714						WOS:000379734700008

On average, the water-soluble organic fraction of the total carbon (TC) mass in submicron aerosols was similar to aEuro-30-35aEuro-% in the oceans with the low chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations, whereas it was similar to aEuro-60aEuro-% in the high-Chl a regions. The average stable carbon isotope ratio of WSOC (delta C-13(WSOC)) was -19.8aEuro-+/- aEuro-2.0aEuro-aEuro degrees, which was systematically higher than that of TC (delta C-13(TC)) (-21.8aEuro-+/- aEuro-1.4aEuro-aEuro degrees). We found that in the oceans with both high and low Chl a concentrations the delta C-13(WSOC) was close to the typical values of delta C-13 for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ranging from -22 to -20aEuro-aEuro degrees in surface seawater of the tropical Pacific Ocean. This suggests an enrichment of marine biological products in WSOC aerosols in the study region regardless of the oceanic area. In particular, enhanced levels of WSOC and biogenic organic marker compounds together with high values of WSOCaEuro-/aEuro-TC ( similar to aEuro-60aEuro-%) and delta C-13(WSOC) were observed over upwelling areas and phytoplankton blooms, which was attributed to planktonic tissues being more enriched in delta C-13. The delta C-13 analysis estimated that, on average, marine sources contribute similar to aEuro-90aEuro-+/- aEuro-25aEuro-% of the aerosol carbon, indicating the predominance of marine-derived carbon in the submicron WSOC. This conclusion is supported by Lagrangian trajectory analysis, which suggests that the majority of the sampling points on the ship had been exposed to marine boundary layer (MBL) air for more than 80aEuro-% of the time during the previous 7 days. The combined analysis of the delta C-13 and monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose, demonstrated that DOC concentration was closely correlated with the concentration levels of submicron WSOC across the study region regardless of the oceanic area. The result implies that DOC may characterize background organic aerosols in the MBL over the study region.

The MF pretreatment step had little effect on the levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the secondary effluent, but the addition of chlorine before MF promoted the formation of organics with anti-estrogenic activity. The distribution of excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence constituents exhibited obvious discrepancies between the secondary effluent and the reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate. Using size exclusion chromatography, DOM with low molecular weights of approximately 1.2 and 0.98 kDa was newly formed during the mWRRO. The normalized genotoxicity and anti-estrogenic activity of the RO concentrate were 32.1 +/- 10.2 mu g4-NQO/mgDOC and 0.36 +/- 0.08 mgTAM/mgDOC, respectively, and these values were clearly higher than those of the secondary effluent and MF permeate. The florescence volume of Regions I and II in the EEM spectrum could be suggested as a surrogate for assessing the genotoxicity and anti-estrogenic activity of the RO concentrate.																	0959-3330	1479-487X					2016	37	17					2149	2156		10.1080/09593330.2016.1144795						WOS:000379772400002	26803912

The DOM in the soil samples with different afforestation time was further characterized via DOC, UV-Visible spectroscopy, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The results suggested that the texture of soil sample was sandy. The extracted DOM from soil consisted mainly of aliphatic chains and only a minor aromatic component. It can be included that afforestation can improve the soil quality to some extent, which can be partly reflected from the indexes like TOC, TN, TP, K+, MBC, and DOC. And the characterization of DOM implied that UV humic-like substances were the major fluorophores components in the DOM of the soil samples, which consisted of aliphatic chains and aromatic components with carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups.																	2090-8865	2090-8873					2016									1480857	10.1155/2016/1480857						WOS:000379522300001

Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter in River Water by Conventional Methods and Direct Sample Analysis-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												The dissolved organic matter in surface waters is composed of fractions of different molecular weight and polarity, characteristics that determine their capacity for complexing different types of pollutants and their environmental impact. In this study, the dissolved organic matter in the surface water of the Bio-Bio River (Central Region of Chile) was characterized chemically and spectroscopically after fractionating by molecular weight and polarity. The technique of direct sample analysis-time of flight-mass spectrometry (DSA-TOF-MS) was used to obtain more information on the composition of dissolved organic matter. It is concluded that dissolved organic matter found in the water of the river from the site of minor human impact (Rucalhue) has a predominantly natural origin, with a high content of aromatic carbon, in contrast to dissolved organic matter found in the waters of the sites that have higher human impact (Laja and Concepcion), characterized by a greater molecular size and higher organic carbon content. These results are consistent with those obtained from DSA-TOF-MS, where higher correlation was observed between the mass spectrum of the standard commercial humic acid and dissolved organic matter found in the sectors of Laja and Concepcion, unlike the spectrum mass of lignin which is more like dissolved organic matter found in the sector Rucalhue.																	2090-9063	2090-9071					2016									1537370	10.1155/2016/1537370						WOS:000379873400001

DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid, hydrophobic neutral, transphilic acid, transphilic neutral, and hydrophilic fraction. The bulk DOM showed DOC variation rates ranging from -2.65 to 26.94%, and the five DOM fractions exhibited DOC variation rates ranging from -22.48 to 78.16%, after freeze-thaw treatments. DOC of water samples were significantly affected by freezing and thawing temperatures, times of freeze-thaw cycles, and freezing time. The aromaticity of DOM and its fractions decreased as a result of freezing-thawing. Both freezing and thawing temperatures had a significant impact on aromatic substances contained in DOM, while the times of freeze-thaw cycles and freezing time made a relative slight influence on them. The freeze-thaw treatments reduced the chlorine reactivity of DOM and its fractions. The freezing temperature and freezing time were significant factors influencing the reactivity of DOM. The freeze-thaw treatments led to an increase in the contents of four types of fluorescent materials contained in DOM. The effect of freezing-thawing was most significant on aromatic protein- and SMP-like fluorescent materials, secondary significant on humic acid-like fluorescent materials, and slightly on fulvic acid-like fluorescent materials.																	1944-3994	1944-3986					2016	57	37					17230	17240		10.1080/19443994.2015.1085913						WOS:000378616600007

Basins separating from the White Sea are the unique natural objects for investigations of properties CDOM, its transformation in the process of turning the marine ecosystem into freshwater environment. CDOM occurring in all types of natural water represents a significant reservoir of organic carbon and plays a key role in the carbon cycle on the Earth. However, aquatic CDOM and nonliving organic matter in sediments from relic separating basins still have not been studied.

Water samples were collected three times from two reservoirs, upstream, midstream, and downstream of the U-Tapao canal. The HPO was the major dissolved organic matter (DOM) fraction in reservoir and canal waters. On average, the HPO accounted for 53 and 45% of the DOM in reservoir and canal waters, respectively. The TPI of 19 and 23% in reservoir and canal waters were determined, respectively. The HPI of 29% of the reservoir water and HPI of 32% of the canal water were detected. For the reservoir water, the highest trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP)/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was determined for the HPI, followed by the TPI and HPO, respectively. The average values of the THMFP/DOC of the HPI, TPI, and HPO of the reservoir water were 78, 52, and 49 mu g THMs/mg C, respectively. The highest THMFP/DOC of the canal water was detected for the HPI, followed by HPO and TPI, respectively. Average values of the THMFP/DOC of HPI of water at upstream and midstream locations of 58 mu g THMs/mg C and downstream location of 113 mu g THMs/mg C were determined. Average values of THMFP/DOC of HPO of water at upstream and midstream and downstream locations were 48 and 93 mu g THMs/mg C, respectively.

Natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an abundant and critical component in wetland biogeochemistry. This study describes the first detailed, comparative, molecular characterization of DOM in subtropical, pulsed, wetlands, namely the Everglades (USA), the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Okavango Delta (Botswana), using optical properties, high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICRMS), and compares compositional features to variations in organic matter sources and flooding characteristics (i.e., differences in hydroperiod). While optical properties showed a high degree of variability within and between the three wetlands, analogies in DOM fluorescence properties were such that an established excitation emission matrix fluorescence parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) model for the Everglades was perfectly applicable to the other two wetlands. Area-normalized H-1 NMR spectra of selected samples revealed clear distinctions of samples while a pronounced congruence within the three pairs of wetland DOM readily suggested the presence of an individual wetland-specific molecular signature. Within sample pairs (long-vs. short-hydroperiod sites), internal differences mainly referred to intensity variations (denoting variable abundance) rather than to alterations of NMR resonances positioning (denoting diversity of molecules). The relative disparity was largest between the Everglades long- and short-hydroperiod samples, whereas Pantanal and Okavango samples were more alike among themselves. Otherwise, molecular divergence was most obvious in the case of unsaturated protons (delta(H) > 5 ppm). 2-D NMR spectroscopy for a particular sample revealed a large richness of aliphatic and unsaturated substructures, likely derived from microbial sources such as periphyton in the Everglades. In contrast, the chemical diversity of aromatic wetland DOM likely originates from a combination of higher plant sources, progressive microbial and photochemical oxidation, and contributions from combustion-derived products (e.g., black carbon). FT-ICRMS spectra of both Okavango and Pantanal showed near 57 +/- 2% CHO, 8 +/- 2% CHOS, 33 +/- 2% CHNO and <1% CHNOS molecules, whereas those of Everglades samples were markedly enriched in CHOS and CHNOS at the expense of CHO and CHNO compounds. In particular, the Everglades short-hydroperiod site showed a large set of aromatic and oxygen-deficient "black sulfur" compounds whereas the long-hydroperiod site contained oxygenated sulfur attached to fused-ring polyphenols. The elevated abundance of CHOS compounds for the Everglades samples likely results from higher inputs of agriculture-derived and sea-spray-derived sulfate. Although wetland DOM samples were found to share many molecular features, each sample was unique in its composition, which reflected specific environmental drivers and/or specific biogeochemical processes.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	8					2257	2277		10.5194/bg-13-2257-2016						WOS:000377276700003

Optical properties and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter along a flow-path continuum from soil pore waters to the Kolyma River mainstem, East Siberia	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Kolyma River in northeast Siberia is among the six largest Arctic rivers and drains a region underlain by vast deposits of Holocene-aged peat and Pleistocene-aged loess known as yedoma, most of which is currently stored in ice-rich permafrost throughout the region. These peat and yedoma deposits are important sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to inland waters that in turn play a significant role in the transport and ultimate remineralization of organic carbon to CO2 and CH4 along the terrestrial flow-path continuum. The turnover and fate of terrigenous DOM during offshore transport largely depends upon the composition and amount of carbon released to inland and coastal waters. Here, we measured the ultraviolet-visible optical properties of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) from a geographically extensive collection of waters spanning soil pore waters, streams, rivers, and the Kolyma River mainstem throughout a similar to 250 km transect of the northern Kolyma River basin. During the period of study, CDOM absorption coefficients were found to be robust proxies for the concentration of DOM, whereas additional CDOM parameters such as spectral slopes (S) were found to be useful indicators of DOM quality along the flow path. In particular, the spectral slope ratio (S-R) of CDOM demonstrated statistically significant differences between all four water types and tracked changes in the concentration of bioavailable DOC, suggesting that this parameter may be suitable for clearly discriminating shifts in organic matter characteristics among water types along the full flow-path continuum across this landscape. However, despite our observations of downstream shifts in DOM composition, we found a relatively constant proportion of DOC that was bioavailable (similar to 3-6% of total DOC) regardless of relative water residence time along the flow path. This may be a consequence of two potential scenarios allowing for continual processing of organic material within the system, namely (a) aquatic microorganisms are acclimating to a downstream shift in DOM composition and/or (b) photodegradation is continually generating labile DOM for continued microbial processing of DOM along the flow-path continuum. Without such processes, we would otherwise expect to see a declining fraction of bioavailable DOC downstream with increasing residence time of water in the system. With ongoing and future permafrost degradation, peat and yedoma deposits throughout the northeast Siberian region will become more hydrologically active, providing greater amounts of DOM to fluvial networks and ultimately to the Arctic Ocean. The ability to rapidly and comprehensively monitor shifts in the quantity and quality of DOM across the landscape is therefore critical for understanding potential future feedbacks within the Arctic carbon cycle.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	8					2279	2290		10.5194/bg-13-2279-2016						WOS:000377276700004

Along-stream transport and transformation of dissolved organic matter in a large tropical river	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Large rivers transport considerable amounts of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the ocean. However, downstream gradients and temporal variability in DOM fluxes and characteristics are poorly studied at the scale of large river basins, especially in tropical areas. Here, we report longitudinal patterns in DOM content and composition based on absorbance and fluorescence measurements along the Zambezi River and its main tributary, the Kafue River, during two hydrological seasons. During high-flow periods, a greater proportion of aromatic and humic DOM was mobilized along rivers due to the hydrological connectivity with wetlands, while low-flow periods were characterized by lower DOM content of less aromaticity resulting from loss of connectivity with wetlands, more efficient degradation of terrestrial DOM and enhanced autochthonous productivity. Changes in water residence time due to contrasting water discharge were found to modulate the fate of DOM along the river continuum. Thus, high water discharge promotes the transport of terrestrial DOM downstream relative to its degradation, while low water discharge enhances the degradation of DOM during its transport. The longitudinal evolution of DOM was also strongly impacted by a hydrological buffering effect in large reservoirs in which the seasonal variability of DOM fluxes and composition was strongly reduced.

Influence of environmental factors on spectral characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Inner Mongolia Plateau, China	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Spectral characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were examined in conjunction with environmental factors in the waters of rivers and terminal lakes within the Hulun Buir plateau, northeast China. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) were significantly higher in terminal lakes than rivers waters (p < 0.01). Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that non-water light absorption and anthropogenic nutrient disturbances were the likely causes of the diversity of water quality parameters. CDOM absorption in river waters was significantly lower than terminal lakes. Analysis of the ratio of absorption at 250 to 365 nm (E-250:365), specific ultraviolet (UV) absorbance (SUVA(254)), and the spectral slope ratio (S-r) indicated that CDOM in river waters had higher aromaticity, molecular weight, and vascular plant contribution than in terminal lakes. Furthermore, results showed that DOC concentration, CDOM light absorption, and the proportion of autochthonous sources of CDOM in plateau waters were all higher than in other freshwater rivers reported in the literature. The strong evapoconcentration, intense ultraviolet irradiance, and landscape features of the Hulun Buir plateau may be responsible for the above phenomenon. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the environmental variables total suspended matter (TSM), TN, and electrical conductivity (EC) had a strong correlation with light absorption characteristics, followed by total dissolved solid (TDS) and chlorophyll a. In most sampling locations, CDOM was the dominant non-water light-absorbing substance. Light absorption by non-algal particles often exceeded that by phytoplankton in the plateau waters. Study of these optical-physicochemical correlations is helpful in the evaluation of the potential influence of water quality factors on non-water light absorption in cold plateau water environments. The construction of a correlation between DOC concentration and water quality factors may help contribute to regional estimates of carbon sources and fate for catchment carbon budget assessments.																	1027-5606	1607-7938					2016	20	2					787	801		10.5194/hess-20-787-2016						WOS:000377697600014

Comparative analyses about the differences of optical characteristics and composition between riverine and reservoir waters in the second Songhuajiang River tributaries were conducted, and the influencing factors impacting on chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and organic carbon (DOC) were examined based on the absorption properties. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total suspended matter (TSM) were significantly higher in the riverine waters, and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was opposite. The relationship between the CDOM absorption coefficient at specific wavelength and DOC concentration both in the riverine and reservoir waters exhibited a positive correlation (r = 0.90, p< 0.01). The close relationship between Chl-a concentration and CDOM absorption confirmed a small amount of phytoplankton absorption to total absorption in the individual samplings. Analysis of absorption ratio (E-250:365), specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), and spectral slope ratio (S-r) indicated that CDOM in riverine waters had lower aromaricity, molecular weight, and vascular plant contributions than in reservoir waters. Furthermore, non-algal particles played an important role in the total non-water absorption for riverine waters, and CDOM was dominant in the reservoir waters. This indicated that the Yinma River watershed was strongly influenced by the artificial discharge. As a parameter of the bio-optical model, the spectral characteristics of CDOM could help to adjust derived algorithms based on remote sensing and to estimate the dissolved organic carbon flux.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2016	25	3					1061	1073		10.15244/pjoes/61669						WOS:000377240700016

Scott			Influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) source on copper speciation and toxicity to Brachionus plicatilis	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Environmental context Organic matter dissolved in water can mitigate toxic effects of copper, which should be taken into account when estimating risks of copper pollution. The composition of this organic matter, however, can vary widely, and these variations might also need to be taken into account. This work addresses the question of organic matter quality and demonstrates that only the amount and not the source influences copper toxicity - good news for risk analysis because it simplifies predictions of the effects of copper in specific receiving waters. Abstract The toxicity of copper in marine systems is dependent on its speciation and bioavailability. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can complex copper, resulting in decreased bioavailability and hence decreased toxicity. The purpose of this study was to measure acute copper LC50 values (concentration lethal to 50% of the organisms) in natural marine waters in a sensitive organism, and identify the relationships between DOM quality and copper toxicity and speciation. Static acute copper toxicity tests (48-h LC50) were performed using the euryhaline rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. Ion-selective electrode measurements of free copper were performed at the LC50 concentrations to determine the influence of DOM source on copper speciation. LC50 values ranged from 333 to 980nM (21.1 to 62.3 mu gL(-1)) with DOC concentrations ranging from 0.55 to 7.57mgCL(-1). DOC was found to be protective (R-2 = 0.72, P = 0.016); however, the degree of protection decreased as DOC increased. This suggests salt-induced colloid formation could be occurring, resulting in a decrease of binding sites available to complex free copper. Free copper remained fairly constant between each sample site, with an average pCu of 10.14. Overall, this study is consistent with other studies that suggest free copper is the best species for predicting toxicity. Additionally, no significant correlation between DOM source and copper toxicity was observed as compared with total DOC concentration and copper toxicity, suggesting that DOM quality does not need to be taken into account for copper toxicity modelling in salt water.

Spectroscopic evidence of anthropogenic compounds extraction from polymers by fluorescent dissolved organic matter in natural water	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN OPTICAL SOCIETY-RAPID PUBLICATIONS												FDOM is one of the most important carriers of anthropogenic compounds in natural waters. It can combine with environmental contaminants and polymers to form diverse chemical structures. To this end, here a microfluidic chip was designed for the analysis of these changes in fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) fingerprints due to thermal treatment and varying time intervals of exposure. Excitation Emission Matrix Spectroscopy (EEMS) approach was utilized to detect and identify the inherent compounds in sampled FDOM. Strong direct correlations were founded, Spearman rank correlation values (rho = 0.85 at alpha = 0.1, n = 4) and linear correlation R-2 = 0.8359 were noted between thermal treatment pattern 2 and fluorescence intensity of samples. Materials, acrylic based glue and cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) polymer, used to design the microfluidic sensor were determined to possess unique spectral features in the ultraviolet to green spectrum using EEMS. The study therefore provides an insight on methods to identify contaminants in natural waters. This underlines the potential of optical sensors providing measurements at fast intervals, enabling environmental monitoring.																	1990-2573						2016	11								16014	10.2971/jeos.2016.16014						WOS:000374213900001

Three fluorescence components were identified using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis, including tryptophan-like Cl, tyrosine-like C2, and humic-like C3. For all samples examined, percentage of Cl varied from 0.49 to 0.61, and the range of C2 and C3 was 0.05-0.31 and 0.09-0.45, respectively. Moreover, Cl linked positively with C2 (R2 = 0.285, p < 0.05), while negatively related to C3 (R2 = 0.577, p < 0.001). Humification degree of DOM was adverse to biological activities (R2 = 0.946, p < 0.001), and humic substances were predominantly derived from terrestrially DOM. In the present study, dissolved organic carbon concentration and C/N ratio significantly affected DOM composition in swine effluent.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	3					885	895								WOS:000373523600022

The Baltic Sea is an ideal research object and observed effects can be transferred to the oceans. This paper combines the influence of biotic and abiotic factors especially for terrigenous dissolved organic matter (tDOM). The study is focused on specific lignin target molecules and reflects the influence of salinity and microbial activity. Samples were taken along the salt gradient. In addition, an incubation experiment, mixing of tDOM-rich river water with Baltic Sea water from three different stations, was carried out. A newly developed pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) method using two different mass selective analyzers in one measurement cycle was established for the analysis of tDOM species. It enables the characterization of natural samples by a universal (electron ionization quadrupole MS) as well as an aromatic fingerprint (resonance-enhanced-multi-photon-ionization time-of-flight MS). By thermal desorption (TD) and subsequent pyrolysis the free volatile and high molecular weight structures are accessible. A huge part of the chemical species exists as high molecular structures. The salt content has a high influence on the composition of DOM. Generally, under TD conditions greater changes were observed, especially for the incubation experiment. Under pyrolysis and the chosen experimental conditions, the lignin apparently is hardly degraded by microorganisms.																	1759-9660	1759-9679					2016	8	12					2592	2603		10.1039/c5ay01292a						WOS:000372758000006

Fluorescence is an important property of DOM and its use is promising for DOM characterization, but has rarely been extended to probing the basic physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity and molecular weight. This study explores the possible linkages between the fluorescence properties and hydrophobicity/molecular weight of DOM, through case studies from three wastewater treatment plants (two membrane bioreactors and one oxidation ditch). The fluorescence properties of different hydrophobic/hydrophilic and molecular-weight fractions of DOM were obtained using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detection. The EEM spectra were interpreted using techniques of fluorescence regional integration, parallel factor analysis, fluorescence spectroscopic indices, and a novel energetic mapping based on fluorophore energy levels. It was found that for all the three plants, the hydrophobic fractions of DOM had a higher fluorescence intensity per UV absorbance (indicating a higher quantum yield) as well as a larger Stokes shifts than the hydrophilic fraction. The lower-molecular-weight fractions generally exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity per total organic carbon (indicating a higher fluorophore density), with the fluorescence distribution at slightly smaller excitation and emission wavelengths. These phenomena were explained via analysis of the fluorophore energy state during the excitation/emission process. The scale of the p-conjugated system in DOM molecules may serve as an intermediate factor in the correlations between the hydrophobicity/molecular weight and the fluorescence properties. These correlations may assist in developing fluorescent probes for the DOM characteristics during the process monitoring of wastewater treatment plants.

Decomposition of SOC may be significantly affected by the supply of plant-derived labile carbon (C). To investigate the impact of plant-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) and urea (N) additions on the decomposition of native SOC as well as to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of priming effects (PEs), a batch of incubation experiments was conducted for 250 days by application of C-13-labeled plant-derived DOM and urea to soils. The direction of PE induced by the addition of DOM was different from the addition of N, i.e. it switched from negative to positive in DOM-amended soils, whereas in the N-treated soil it switched from positive to negative. Adding DOM alone was favorable for soil C sequestration (59 +/- 5 mg C per kg soil), whereas adding N alone or together with DOM accelerated the decomposition of native SOC, causing net C losses (-62 +/- 4 and -34 +/- 31 mg C per kg soil, respectively). These findings indicate that N addition and its interaction with DOM are not favorable for soil C sequestration. Adding DOM alone increased the level of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), but it did not increase the level of soil mineral N. Changes in the ratio of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) to microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) and microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) after the addition of DOM and N suggest that a possible shift in the microbial community composition may occur in the present study. Adding DOM with or without N increased the activities of beta-glucosidase and urease. Changes in the direction and magnitude of PE were closely related to changes in soil C and N availability. Soil C and N availability might influence the PE through affecting the microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity as well as causing a possible shift in the microbial community composition.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2016	18	3					330	341		10.1039/c5em00446b						WOS:000372249800005	26791412

Comparing the diel cycles of dissolved organic matter fluorescence in a clear-water and two dark-water Wisconsin lakes: potential insights into lake metabolism	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The cycling of organic carbon is fundamental to aquatic ecosystems, reflecting processes that extend from terrestrial watersheds to fish. Here, we use embedded fluorescence sensors that sample at high frequency to investigate the daily dynamics of a proxy for the major pool of organic carbon (chromophoric dissolved organic matter, CDOM) in a clear-water Wisconsin lake (similar to 3 mg C.L-1). We compare the diel CDOM cycle in this lake with cycles observed previously in two dark-water lakes (10 to 20 mg C.L-1). Despite differences in DOM quality and quantity, diel fluorescence cycles were evident in the epilimnia and hypolimnia of all three lakes. The amplitude differed among lakes, but the timing of the diel cycles was similar, with increases in fluorescence during nighttime and decreases during daylight (except in the aphotic hypolimnion of the darkest lake). The amplitude of the diel cycle increased with increasing DOM concentration, and estimates of DOM turnover based on the magnitude of oscillation ranged from 0.28 mg C.L-1.day(-1) in the darkest lake to 0.14 mg C.L-1.day(-1) in the clear lake. Independent estimates of free water metabolism based on the daily dynamics of O-2 or CO2 were in general agreement, ranging from 0.32 to 0.06 mg C.L-1.day(-1). Although absolute rates of turnover varied directly with DOM concentration, relative rates were highest in clear waters (similar to 5%.day(-1)). We conclude that these daily oscillations may be a common property of lakes and that they may provide insights into internal DOM processing over short time scales.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2016	73	1					65	75		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0172						WOS:000370048500006

Hydrological and biogeochemical controls on watershed dissolved organic matter transport: pulse-shunt concept	ECOLOGY												Hydrological precipitation and snowmelt events trigger large pulse releases of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) into drainage networks due to an increase in DOM concentration with discharge. Thus, low-frequency large events, which are predicted to increase with climate change, are responsible for a significant percentage of annual terrestrial DOM input to drainage networks. These same events are accompanied by marked and rapid increases in headwater stream velocity; thus they also shunt a large proportion of the pulsed DOM to downstream, higher-order rivers and aquatic ecosystems geographically removed from the DOM source of origin. Here we merge these ideas into the pulse-shunt concept (PSC) to explain and quantify how infrequent, yet major hydrologic events may drive the timing, flux, geographical dispersion, and regional metabolism of terrestrial DOM. The PSC also helps reconcile long-standing discrepancies in C cycling theory and provides a robust framework for better quantifying its highly dynamic role in the global C cycle. The PSC adds a critical temporal dimension to linear organic matter removal dynamics postulated by the river continuum concept. It also can be represented mathematically through a model that is based on stream scaling approaches suitable for quantifying the important role of streams and rivers in the global C cycle. Initial hypotheses generated by the PSC include: (1) Infrequent large storms and snowmelt events account for a large and underappreciated percentage of the terrestrial DOM flux to drainage networks at annual and decadal time scales and therefore event statistics are equally important to total discharge when determining terrestrial fluxes. (2) Episodic hydrologic events result in DOM bypassing headwater streams and being metabolized in large rivers and exported to coastal systems. We propose that the PSC provides a framework for watershed biogeochemical modeling and predictions and discuss implications to ecological processes.

Colored dissolved organic matter in shallow estuaries: relationships between carbon sources and light attenuation	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Light availability is of primary importance to the ecological function of shallow estuaries. For example, benthic primary production by submerged aquatic vegetation is contingent upon light penetration to the seabed. A major component that attenuates light in estuaries is colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). CDOM is often measured via a proxy, fluorescing dissolved organic matter (fDOM), due to the ease of in situ fDOM sensor measurements. Fluorescence must be converted to CDOM absorbance for use in light attenuation calculations. However, this CDOM-fDOM relationship varies among and within estuaries. We quantified the variability in this relationship within three estuaries along the mid-Atlantic margin of the eastern United States: West Falmouth Harbor (MA), Barnegat Bay (NJ), and Chincoteague Bay (MD/VA). Land use surrounding these estuaries ranges from urban to developed, with varying sources of nutrients and organic matter. Measurements of fDOM (excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm (+/- 5 nm) and 460 nm (+/- 40 nm), respectively) and CDOM absorbance were taken along a terrestrial-to-marine gradient in all three estuaries. The ratio of the absorption coefficient at 340 nm (m(-1)) to fDOM (QSU) was higher in West Falmouth Harbor (1.22) than in Barnegat Bay (0.22) and Chincoteague Bay (0.17). The CDOM: fDOM absorption ratio was variable between sites within West Falmouth Harbor and Barnegat Bay, but consistent between sites within Chincoteague Bay. Stable carbon isotope analysis for constraining the source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in West Falmouth Harbor and Barnegat Bay yielded delta C-13 values ranging from 19.7 to 26.1 parts per thousand and 20.8 to 26.7 parts per thousand, respectively. Concentration and stable carbon isotope mixing models of DOC (dissolved organic carbon) indicate a contribution of C-13-enriched DOC in the estuaries. The most likely source of C-13-enriched DOC for the systems we investigated is Spartina cordgrass. Comparison of DOC source to CDOM: fDOM absorption ratios at each site demonstrates the relationship between source and optical properties. Samples with C-13-enriched carbon isotope values, indicating a greater contribution from marsh organic material, had higher CDOM: fDOM absorption ratios than samples with greater contribution from terrestrial organic material. Applying a uniform CDOM: fDOM absorption ratio and spectral slope within a given estuary yields errors in modeled light attenuation ranging from 11 to 33% depending on estuary. The application of a uniform absorption ratio across all estuaries doubles this error. This study demonstrates that light attenuation coefficients for CDOM based on continuous fDOM records are highly dependent on the source of DOM present in the estuary. Thus, light attenuation models for estuaries would be improved by quantification of CDOM absorption and DOM source identification.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	2					583	595		10.5194/bg-13-583-2016						WOS:000369524500017

Different land use types may alter DOM amount and composition in freshwaters. Here, water samples were collected from the outlets of 16 subcatchments within mixed land use patterns in the South Tiaoxi River in Eastern China. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DOM absorption coefficient (alpha(350)), and fluorescence spectrum were measured. These 16 subcatchments were grouped into four clusters with different land use features: natural forest land, planted forest land (Phyllostachys praecox, a bamboo species), cropland, and residential land. Two humic-like and two protein-like fluorescent components were identified using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). DOC concentrations were the lowest in natural forest land dominated subcatchments as compared to other land uses with intensive anthropogenic activities, so did alpha(350) and fluorescent intensities of different components. Protein-like fluorescence was more pronounced for the subcatchments dominated by residential land, while terrestrial humic-like fluorescence was the most abundant component for the subcatchments dominated by the other three land use types. The relationships between the percentage of cropland and that of fluorescence fraction appear to be a threshold response, indicating that effects on DOM composition varied with agricultural activity patterns. The reservoir would have a positive effect on DOM amount and the percentage of protein-like fluorescence associated with autochthonous activities. This study in general shows the impact of anthropogenic land use patterns on the amount and composition of DOM in headwater streams, which may affect ecosystem function and health of aquatic environments.

Analysis of dissolved organic matter fluorescence using self-organizing maps: mini-review and tutorial	ANALYTICAL METHODS												The analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence has facilitated tracing throughout both natural and engineered aquatic systems, and the connection of DOM quality to its effectiveness as a binding agent, nutrient source, and generator of disinfection byproducts. While methods that deconvolute fluorescence into distinct underlying components have been instrumental in this endeavour, the vast majority of subsequent analyses has been limited to isolated parts/components, whereas DOM is a complex and dynamic system of interacting molecules. Tools for pattern recognition such as Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOMs) are capable of analyzing DOM fluorescence holistically, either by recomposing the parts isolated via PARAFAC, or by analyzing fluorescence in its entirety; however, the SOM has been underutilized in this endeavour, largely due to the difficulty of implementation and optimization. This report briefly summarizes the prior application of the SOM to DOM fluorescence, followed by a brief introduction to its theory and utility. An instructional tutorial and user-friendly 'Fluor_SOmap' Matlab package have been included to assist researchers in implementing SOMs. Four modes of fluorescence data analysis are facilitated by the package, including: whole EEMs, excitation-emission wavelength pairs, component scores from PARAFAC, and overall fluorescence composition. It is hoped that this tutorial and the associated package will help researchers implement and interpret SOMs to extend the scope and utility of fluorescence analysis.																	1759-9660	1759-9679					2016	8	4					716	725		10.1039/c5ay02549d						WOS:000368943700002

Riverine DOM sources are highly dependent on the hydrological connection between the river channel and the surrounding terrestrial ecosystems, but how the lack of this connectivity (e.g., during drought episodes) affects the sources and biodegradation of DOM in rivers remains unclear. Here we identified the DOM sources as well as the different DOM pools that are respired along a Mediterranean river during drought by combining absorbance-fluorescence spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, biodegradation assays, and stable and radiocarbon isotopes. DOM composition was highly heterogeneous along the river in response to different sources and in-stream processes in each distinct aquatic environment (i.e., isolated water pools, running waters, and impounded waters in weirs). The reduced hydrological connectivity with terrestrial ecosystems promoted the influence of autochthonous DOM sources. Still, tree leaves from overhanging canopies stood out as an important terrestrial DOM source, especially in sites where water residence time was high such as isolated pools and weirs. Degradation of leaf leachates was a relevant process in these sites, whereas autochthonous DOM and groundwater millennial DOM (> 1300 year B.P.) seemed to be degraded in running waters. Overall, our results highlight that the drought-induced hydrological disconnection entails a great spatial heterogeneity in the sources of DOM, which at the same time determines the different DOM pools that are respired in each environment along the river.

This study aims at: (i) distinguishing between the quality of DOM in waters draining palm oil plantations (OP), secondary forests (SF) and coastal swamps (CS) and, (ii) identifying the seasonal variability of DOM quantity and quality. Surface waters were sampled during fieldwork campaigns that spanned the wet and dry seasons. DOM was characterised optically by using the fluorescence Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM), the absorption coefficient at 340 nm and the spectral slope coefficient (S). Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was undertaken to assess the DOM composition from EEM spectra and five terrestrial derived components were identified: (C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5). Components C1 and C4 contributed the most to DOM fluorescence in all study areas during both the wet and dry seasons. The results suggest that component C4 could be a significant (and common) PARAFAC signal found in similar catchments. Peak M (C2 and C3) was dominant in all samples collected during wet and dry seasons, which could be anthropogenic in origin given the active land use change in the study area. In conclusion, there were significant seasonal and spatial variations in DOM which demonstrated the effects of land use cover and precipitation amounts in the Kinabatangan catchment.

In this study, the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality in a newly constructed dam reservoir and its tributaries were monitored monthly during the initial impounding period (July to November 2014) using a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with online organic carbon detector (OCD). The highest values were observed in the month of August with the highest precipitation for the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and most of the assigned size fractions (except for biopolymers) in the tributaries, indicating that allochthonous sources of DOM were dominant in the feeding stream waters of the reservoir. The bulk DOC and high molecular weight humic substance fraction (similar to 1 kDa) were generally co-varied with the monthly precipitation in the tributaries, while building blocks (350-500 Da), and low molecular weight (LMW) acids and neutrals showed different trends. In a dam site, the smaller molecular fractions became more abundant during the dry season (September to November), presumably due to the in-reservoir processes such as photo- and bio-degradation. Our results also revealed that storms mobilized a large amount of highly aromatic soil-derived DOM to the reservoir. A depth profile at the dam site showed the water is well mixed up to a depth of similar to 20 m. The SEC-OCD data coupled with non-metric multidimensional scaling provided a clear visualization of the spatiotemporal variations in DOM composition, which shed new light on the DOM composition formed in a newly constructed dam reservoir and also on the strategies for future water treatment options.

Investigating the Temporal Effects of Metal-Based Coagulants to Remove Mercury from Solution in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The presence of mercury (Hg), particularly methylmercury (MeHg), is a concern for both human and ecological health as MeHg is a neurotoxin and can bioaccumulate to lethal levels in upper trophic level organisms. Recent research has demonstrated that coagulation with metal-based salts can effectively remove both inorganic mercury (IHg) and MeHg from solution through association with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and subsequent flocculation and precipitation. In this study, we sought to further examine interactions between Hg and DOM and the resulting organo-metallic precipitate (floc) to assess if (1) newly added IHg could be removed to the same extent as ambient IHg or whether the association between IHg and DOM requires time, and (2) once formed, if the floc has the capacity to remove additional Hg from solution. Agricultural drainage water samples containing ambient concentrations of both DOM and IHg were spiked with a traceable amount of isotopically enriched IHg and dosed with ferric sulfate after 0, 1, 5, and 30 days. Both ambient and newly added IHg were removed within hours, with 69-79 % removed. To a separate sample set, isotopically enriched IHg was added to solution after floc had formed. Under those conditions, 81-95 % of newly added Hg was removed even at Hg concentrations 1000-fold higher than ambient levels. Results of this study indicate coagulation with ferric sulfate effectively removes both ambient and newly added IHg entering a system and suggests rapid association between IHg and DOM. This work also provides new information regarding the ability of floc to remove additional Hg from solution even after it has formed.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JAN	2016	57	1					220	228		10.1007/s00267-015-0601-2						WOS:000367917900016	26330169

Temporal variation in optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Southern California coastal waters with nearshore kelp and seagrass	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured in surf zone waters in diurnal field studies at a Southern California beach with nearshore kelp and seagrass beds and intertidal plant wrack. Absorption coefficients (a(CDOM)(300 nm)) ranged from 0.35 m(-1) to 3.7 m(-1) with short-term variability<1 h, increases at ebb and flood tides and higher values (6 m(-1)) during an offshore storm event. Spectral slopes (S) ranged from 0.0028 nm(-1) to 0.017 nm(-1), with higher values after the storm; S was generally inversely correlated with a(CDOM)(300 nm). 3-D excitation-emission matrix spectra (EEMs) for samples with lower S values had humic-type peaks associated with terrestrial material (A, C), marine microbial material (M) and protein peaks, characteristic of freshly produced organic material. Samples with high S values had no or reduced protein peaks, consistent with aged material. Fluorescent indexes (f450/f500 >2.5, BIX>1.1) were consistent with microbial aquatic sources. Leachates of senescent kelp and seagrass had protein and humic-type EEM peaks. After solar simulator irradiation (4 h), protein peaks rapidly photochemically degraded, humic-type peak C increased in intensity and peak M disappeared. Optical characteristics of kelp leachates were most similar to field samples, consistent with minimal contributions from sea grass, a small component of the biomass at this site. Increases in a(CDOM)(300 nm) with decreases in S are attributed to the input of freshly produced autochthonous organic material at ebbing and flooding tides, from exudation and microbial processing of senescent plant wrack and nearshore macroalgal vegetation. Other allochthonous sources are hypothesized to be ground water seepage and terrestrial runoff.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2016	61	1					32	46		10.1002/lno.10198						WOS:000367983800003

Although DOC contributes at least 60% to COD, its decrease in the constructed wetland is mainly caused by the more extensive degradation of elements N, H, S, and P than C in DOM, and 65% is contributed from the former. DOM is mainly consisted of microbial products based on proxies f(470/520) and BIX, indicating that DOM in water is apparently affected by microbial degradation. The result based on PARAFAC model shows that DOM in the constructed wetland contains protein-like and humus-like components, and Fulvic- and humic-like components are relatively easier to degrade than protein-like components. Fulvic- and humic-like components undergo similar decomposition in the constructed wetland. A common source of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) exists; both CDOM and FDOM are mainly composed of a humus-like material and do not exhibit selective degradation in the constructed wetland. The proxies E-2/E-3, A(240 similar to 400), r((A, c)) and HIX in water have no changes after flowing into the constructed wetland, implying that the humification degree of DOM in water is hardly affected by wet constructed wetland. However, the constructed wetland environment is not only beneficial in forming the reduced state of DOM, but also facilitates the reduction of ferric. It can also improve the capability of DOM to function as an electron shuttle. This result may be related to the condition that the aromatic carbon of DOM can be stabilized well in the constructed wetland.																	1000-0593					JAN	2016	36	1					206	212		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)01-0206-07						WOS:000368043800041		
J	Le Roux, J; Nihemaiti, M; Croue, JP				Le Roux, Julien; Nihemaiti, Maolida; Croue, Jean-Philippe			The role of aromatic precursors in the formation of haloacetamides by chloramination of dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												Water treatment utilities are diversifying their water sources and often rely on waters enriched in nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., ammonia, organic nitrogen such as amino acids). The disinfection of waters exhibiting high levels of nitrogen has been associated with the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloacetamides (HAcAms). While the potential precursors of HANs have been extensively studied, only few investigations are available regarding the nature of HAcAm precursors. Previous research has suggested that HAcAms are hydrolysis products of HANs. Nevertheless, it has been recently suggested that HAcAms can be formed independently, especially during chloramination of humic substances. When used as a disinfectant, monochloramine can also be a source of nitrogen for N-DBPs. This study investigated the role of aromatic organic matter in the formation of N-DBPs (HAcAms and HANs) upon chloramination. Formation kinetics were performed from various fractions of organic matter isolated from surface waters or treated wastewater effluents. Experiments were conducted with N-15-labeled monochloramine ((NH2Cl)-N-15) to trace the origin of nitrogen. N-DBP formation showed a two-step profile: (1) a rapid formation following second-order reaction kinetics and incorporating nitrogen atom originating from the organic matrix (e.g., amine groups); and (2) a slower and linear increase correlated with exposure to chloramines, incorporating inorganic nitrogen (N-15) from (NH2Cl)-N-15 into aromatic moieties. Organic matter isolates showing high aromatic character (i.e., high SUVA) exhibited high reactivity characterized by a major incorporation of N-15 in N-DBPs. A significantly lower incorporation was observed for low-aromatic-content organic matter. N-15-DCAcAm and N-15-DCAN formations exhibited a linear correlation, suggesting a similar behavior of N-15 incorporation as SUVA increases. Chloramination of aromatic model compounds (i.e., phenol and resorcinol) showed higher HAcAm and HAN formation potentials than nitrogenous precursors (i.e., amino acids) usually considered as main precursors of these N-DBPs. These results demonstrate the importance of aromatic organic compounds in the formation of N-DBPs, which is of significant importance for water treatment facilities using chloramines as final disinfectant.

Biochar amendment to soil changes dissolved organic matter content and composition	CHEMOSPHERE												Amendments of biochar, a product of pyrolysis of biomass, have been shown to increase fertility of acidic soils by enhancing soil properties such as pH, cation-exchange-capacity and water-holding-capacity. These parameters are important in the context of natural organic matter contained in soils, of which dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the mobile and most bioavailable fraction. The effect of biochar on the content and composition of DOM in soils has received little research attention. This study focuses on the effects of amendments of two different biochars to an acidic acrisol and a pH-neutral brown soil. A batch experiment showed that mixing biochar with the acrisols at a 10 wt.% dose increased the pH from 4.9 to 8.7, and this resulted in a 15-fold increase in the dissolved organic carbon concentration (from 4.5 to 69 mg L-1). The pH-increase followed the same trend as the release of DOM in the experiment, causing higher DOM solubility and desorption of DOM from mineral sites. The binding to biochar of several well-characterised reference DOM materials was also investigated and results showed a higher sorption of aliphatic DOM to biochar than aromatic DOM, with DOM-water partitioning coefficients (Kd-values) ranging from 0.2 to 590 L kg(-1). A size exclusion occurring in biochar's micropores, could result in a higher sorption of smaller aliphatic DOM molecules than larger aromatic ones. These findings indicate that biochar could increase the leaching of DOM from soil, as well as change the DOM composition towards molecules with a larger size and higher aromaticity.

Moreover, the degree and mechanism of interaction between different minerals may influence their surface reactivity. We therefore aimed to understand mineral surface modifications brought about by different Fe (hydr)oxide-vermiculite associations, and their influence on OM sorption. This could have important implications on OM dynamics in young hydromorphic soils where seasonal variations in redox conditions may affect mineral surfaces. Paddy soil-derived dissolved OM was used in sorption isotherms on mixed mineral phases obtained by precipitating different amounts of Fe (hydr)oxides on vermiculite. Results evidenced that the surface properties of vermiculite strongly drove Fe (hydr)oxide precipitation, and consequently OM sorption mechanisms. The change in surface charge with increasing Fe loading resulted in a higher retention of dissolved organic carbon. However, dissolved organic nitrogen adsorption isotherms and FTIR carboxyl vibrational shifts revealed the occurrence of two binding mechanisms, one driven by electrostatic attraction of N-containing compounds by the negatively charged vermiculite surface, and another involving ligand exchange of carboxylic compounds with the positive oxides, precipitated in localized nucleation sites. Moreover, the modification of both solution and solid properties during sorption, promoted the selective adsorption of aromatic molecules with increasing Fe coverage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Use of ESI-FTICR-MS to Characterize Dissolved Organic Matter in Headwater Streams Draining Forest-Dominated and Pasture-Dominated Watersheds	PLOS ONE												Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) has proven to be a powerful technique revealing complexity and diversity of natural DOM molecules, but its application to DOM analysis in grazing-impacted agricultural systems remains scarce. In the present study, we presented a case study of using ESI-FTICR-MS in analyzing DOM from four headwater streams draining forest-or pasture-dominated watersheds in Virginia, USA. In all samples, most formulas were CHO compounds (71.8-87.9%), with other molecular series (CHOS, CHON, CHONS, and CHOP (N, S)) accounting for only minor fractions. All samples were dominated by molecules falling in the lignin-like region (H/C = 0.7-1.5, O/C = 0.1-0.67), suggesting the predominance of allochthonous, terrestrial plant-derived DOM. Relative to the two pasture streams, DOM formulas in the two forest streams were more similar, based on Jaccard similarity coefficients and nonmetric multidimensional scaling calculated from Bray-Curtis distance. Formulas from the pasture streams were characterized by lower proportions of aromatic formulas and lower unsaturation, suggesting that the allochthonous versus autochthonous contributions of organic matter to streams were modified by pasture land use. The number of condensed aromatic structures (CAS) was higher for the forest streams, which is possibly due to the controlled burning in the forest-dominated watersheds and suggests that black carbon was mobilized from soils to streams. During 15-day biodegradation experiments, DOM from the two pasture streams was altered to a greater extent than DOM from the forest streams, with formulas with H/C and O/C ranges similar to protein (H/C = 1.5-2.2, O/C = 0.3-0.67), lipid (H/C = 1.5-2.0, O/C = 0-0.3), and unsaturated hydrocarbon (H/C = 0.7-1.5, O/C = 0-0.1) being the most bioreactive groups. Aromatic compound formulas including CAS were preferentially removed during combined light+bacterial incubations, supporting the contention that black carbon is labile to light alterations. Collectively, our data demonstrate that head-water DOM composition contains integrative information on watershed sources and processes, and the application of ESI-FTICR-MS technique offers additional insights into compound composition and reactivity unrevealed by fluorescence and stable carbon isotopic measurements.																	1932-6203					DEC 29	2015	10	12							e0145639	10.1371/journal.pone.0145639						WOS:000367481900062	26713621

Photobleaching of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in Beaufort Sea and North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) samples collected from water masses of Beaufort Sea (n = 12) and the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (NASG; n = 6) were assessed based on susceptibilities of its parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeled fluorescent components to photobleaching over 72 hours of simulated solar irradiation. 315 excitation-emission matrix spectra (EEMs) were PARAFAC modeled yielding 4 humic-like (C1-3 and C5) and 1 protein-like (C4) fluorescent components. Protein-like C4 and humic-like C5 did not adhere to first order kinetics and did not yield decay rate constant (k) or half-life (t(1/2)) values as part of this study. Humic-like Cl was found to be most resilient to photodegradation with lowest k values. Principal component analysis (PCA) illustrated a shift towards C1% with photo-exposure in addition to distinguishing compositions of C1-5% in Beaufort Sea halocline and Atlantic layer as well as NASG deep water masses. When Beaufort Sea water masses were considered, k of C2 was found to be lower in upper (UH) and mid (MH) halocline layers when compared to lower halocline (LH) and underlying Atlantic layer (AL; p<0.10). This suggested that C2 in Pacific-derived seawater was less photoreactive than C2 in Atlantic-derived seawater in Beaufort Sea, likely as a result of distinct formation pathways of these water masses. Similarly, C2 in upper Labrador Seawater (ULSW) and 'classical' Labrador seawater (LSW) was less photolabile than in deeper NASG layers (Iceland-Scotland and Denmark Strait overflow waters; ISOW and DSOW). Interestingly, despite similar formation pathways of AL in Beaufort Sea and deeper waters sampled from NASG (ISOW + DSOW), lower k for Cl was found in NASG. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Romera-Castillo, C; Jaffe, R				Romera-Castillo, Cristina; Jaffe, Rudolf			Free radical scavenging (antioxidant activity) of natural dissolved organic matter	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Free radicals are produced in aquatic environments through photochemical reactions. They can affect the concentration and composition of organic matter and have negative effects on aquatic organisms. Free radical scavengers (antioxidants) can remove these highly reactive species from the media. Some dissolved organic matter (DOM) constituents are widely known to present antioxidant properties (e.g. phenols and hydroquinones). However, little is known about the free radical scavenger capacity of DOM. Here we applied two simple, analytical assays (ABST and DPPH) to assess the antioxidant capacity of aquatic DOM, after their validation against a more complex electrochemical technique. These assays were applied to DOM from various environmental settings, including freshwater marshes, fringe mangrove estuaries and a coastal bay in Everglades National Park, Florida. All the samples presented different degrees of antioxidant activity depending on their origin and thus DOM quality. Samples associated with mangrove areas presented the highest antioxidant activity, possibly due to the presence of tannins, which are known to be powerful antioxidants. The free radical scavenging capacity or antioxidant properties of DOM may have important implications in aquatic photochemistry as well as in microbial processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Interaction between iron and dissolved organic matter in a marine shallow hydrothermal system off Dominica Island (Lesser Antilles)	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Shallow submarine hydrothermal systems are extreme environments with unique biogeochemical conditions, originating from the interaction of hot, reduced fluids and cold, oxygenated seawater. Hydrothermal fluids represent one of the marine sources of essential trace elements like iron, the flux of which is controlled by dissolved organic matter (DOM) in and between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, the selectivity of the DOM with iron in marine environments is not well understood. Here we characterized at a molecular level the marine hydrothermal iron-DOM interaction using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Our study site was a shallow-water hydrothermal system off Dominica Island (Lesser Antilles, Caribbean Sea), where reduced fluids were strongly enriched in dissolved Fe and Si as compared to surface seawater. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was lower in the hydrothermal fluids, most likely due to low-DOC meteoric water influence, but also suggesting biotic or abiotic processes consuming or depleting DOC when seawater is re-circulated through the sediment. The formation of hydrous ferric oxides upon aeration of the hydrothermal fluids for 10 h leads to an 8% decrease in DOC, indicating co-precipitation of iron and DOM. Resolubilization of iron precipitates revealed increased relative abundance of aromatic compounds in coprecipitated DOM, which is in accordance with iron-coagulation observed in terrestrial environments. In conclusion, we provide evidence of co-precipitation of DOM with iron at hydrothermal systems as a selective process, which characteristically alters the molecular composition of DOM released with hydrothermal fluids.

H.; Mopper, Kenneth			Characterization and photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a tropical lake and its dominant primary producer, the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa	MARINE CHEMISTRY												This study investigates optical and high-resolution molecular signatures and photochemical degradation of DOM from the Barra Bonita Reservoir (BB-DOM), a tropical eutrophic lake, as well as from its dominant phytoplankton species, the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (Microcystis-DOM). Consistent with a predominantly autotrophic source, BB-DOM and Microcystis-DOM exhibited high protein-like fluorescence and contained a large number of aliphatics. Microcystis-DOM was enriched in peptide-like formulae, while BB-DOM had higher chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM) and was enriched in moderately unsaturated formulae, indicating additions of terrigenous DOM and/or in situ processing of autochthonous material in the lake. Consistent with its higher CDOM content, BB-DOM was more photoreactive than Microcystis-DOM. For both types of DOM, photodegradation resulted in loss of CDOM, FDOM, moderately unsaturated structures, high O/C and low H/C formulae, and preservation of aliphatics. The majority of photoproducts of 0.5 d irradiation were subsequently removed by day 7, and photoproducts represented a minor fraction of the photo-irradiated DOM. For BB-DOM, molecular formula photolability increased with increasing aromaticity index values, while for Microcystis-DOM, molecular formula photolability increased with molecular mass. Photodegradation increased the proportion of molecular formulae containing N (CHO + N) in BB-DOM, while the molecular mass and the proportion of CHO + N formulae decreased upon photo-irradiation of Microcystis-DOM. In concert, these molecular shifts due to photodegradation decreased the diversity of and increased the similarity between BB-DOM and Microcystis-DOM, suggesting the selective pressure exerted by photochemistry selects for the survival of similar compounds in both samples.

Molecular-level changes of dissolved organic matter along the Amazon River-to-ocean continuum	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Coastal oceans link terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Yet, carbon sources and sinks in these biomes remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the Amazon River-to-ocean continuum from the lower mainstem at Obidos to the open ocean of the western tropical North Atlantic. We molecularly characterized DOM via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), determined DOM stable carbon isotopes, and interpreted the data in the context of bacterial abundance and production, phytoplankton biomass and composition. Multivariate analysis revealed that the DOM molecular variability in the plume was mainly influenced by the input of terrigenous DOM. Incubation experiments with water from close to the river mouth showed that photo- and bio-degradation preferentially removed C-13-depleted and C-13-enriched terrigenous DOM, respectively. However, there was no significant quantitative change in the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over five days. This result suggests that most of the reactive DOM had already been bio-degraded upstream within the river and that photo-degradation was diminished in the turbid plume close to the river mouth. Terrigenous DOM therefore appeared to be relatively non-reactive nearshore. In the less turbid offshore plume, enhanced light penetration stimulated growth of phytoplankton and increased bacterial production. Although marine DOM compounds became relatively enriched, bulk DOC concentrations were 9 to 30% below levels expected from conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers suggesting that quantitative removal of terrigenous DOM was not compensated by marine DOM production. We propose that removal of terrigenous DOM in the outer plume may be enhanced by (i) bio-degradation primed by reactive algal DOM, (ii) photo-degradation, which may further break down DOM into more bio-available forms, and possibly (iii) sorption of DOM to sinking particles.

Fluorescent dissolved organic matter as a multivariate biogeochemical tracer of submarine groundwater discharge in coral reef ecosystems	MARINE CHEMISTRY												In Hawai'i and other Pacific high islands submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) can be a significant and continuous source of solutes to nearshore reefs and may play a key role in the structure and function of benthic coral and algal communities. Identifying SGD sources and linking them to reef biogeochemistry is technically challenging. Here we analyzed spectra of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) in coral reefs in the context of a suite of biogeochemical parameters along gradients of SGD to characterize fDOM composition and evaluate the utility of fDOM signatures in tracking groundwater dispersal and transformation We spatially mapped water column chemistry in Maunalua Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i by collecting 24 water samples in grids at each of two similar to 0.15 km(2) regions during both high and low tides over a two-day period. We observed clear horizontal gradients in the majority of 15 measured parameters, including inorganic and organic solutes and organic particles that tracked concentrations of conservative SGD tracers (radon, salinity and silicate). Multivariate scanning excitation-emission fluorometry successfully differentiated two distinct groundwater sources and delineated regions of SGD dispersion in each reef from the surrounding water column samples without detectable groundwater. Groundwater was consistently depleted in DOC and enriched in nutrients; although the two SGD sources varied widely in fDOM quantity and fluorophore proportions, indices of humification were consistently elevated in SGD at both sites. Our results provide a robust spectral characterization of fDOM in SGD-influenced coral reefs and indicate the potential for this rapid and cost-effective measurement technique to be useful in tracking SGD dispersal in nearshore ecosystems.

J	Rossel, PE; Stubbins, A; Hach, PF; Dittmar, T				Rossel, Pamela E.; Stubbins, Aron; Hach, Philipp F.; Dittmar, Thorsten			Bioavailability and molecular composition of dissolved organic matter from a diffuse hydrothermal system	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Fluids from the diffusive hydrothermal vent Woody located at the Menez Gwen hydrothermal field were collected directly from a fissure using a Kiel pumping system (KIPS). The fluids were incubated in a biodegradation experiment with the resident microbial community at in situ temperature (55 degrees C). In addition to the initial fluid (T-0), sub-samples were collected at three time points: 12.5 h (T-1), 38 h (T-2) and 180 h (T-final). Whole water samples were characterized by spectrophotometry and for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations. Solid-phase extracted dissolved organic matter (SPE-DOM) was molecularly characterized using a 15 Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS). Based on Mg2+ concentrations, vent fluids were diluted ca. 1:99% with seawater. SPE-DOC concentrations remained constantly low (30 mu M) over the course of incubation, while DOC and TDN (1180 mu M and 16 mu M, respectively, at T-0) decreased sharply (to 80 mu M and 9 mu M, respectively, at T-final). This biolabile DOC is likely composed of volatiles and short-chain hydrocarbons, and the reason behind their extraordinarily high concentration remains unknown. Molecular characterization of SPE-DOM in fluids and seawater identified over 3000 molecular formulae, which were separated into different groups according to their reactivity. The half-life of the more reactive groups ranged between 6-7 h, 18-21 h and 5-106 days, and represented 7.3, 2.0 and 7.5% of the total formulae present in T-0, while the majority (83%) did not exhibit any significant trend during the experiment. Despite the small molecular changes in SPE-DOM, a decrease in the number of formulae and average molecular mass was observed, the latter consistent with an increase in the spectral slope over the wavelength range 275-295 nm (S275-295) during the experiment. An increase in aromatic molecular formulae during the incubation was also corroborated by a concurrent increase in the absorption coefficient at 254 nm normalized to DOC concentrations (SUVA(254)), an optical indicator of aromatic content. Thus both FT-ICR-MS and optical properties over the course of the incubation corroborated a decrease in molecular mass and increase in aromaticity. This study is the first to report the optical and molecular transformations of bio-labile DOM from diffusive hydrothermal systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The very low DOC values in the deep Med Sea were unexpected since the renewal time of deep waters in the basin is only 20-126 years. Over this short timescale, we expected just a very small, nearly undetectable, fraction of refractory DOC (RDOC) to be removed. The first DOC isotope data show that DOC in Med Sea deep water is more depleted in both Delta C-14 and delta C-13 than in the deep Atlantic Ocean, with an estimated age of 4500-5100 years. These data suggest that at least 10%, and up to 45%, of the Atlantic RDOC entering the Med Sea is removed and replaced by isotopically lighter DOC in less than 126 years. Potential allocthonous sources include: fossil methane and methane derived DOC seeps from sediments, anthropogenic combustion products and terrestrial organic matter delivered by the atmosphere, rivers, and groundwaters. Using current information, it is not possible to quantify the relative contribution of these potential sources. Based on estimated flux and isotopic value, atmospheric input of soluble organic carbon from soils or combustion products as well as DOC from groundwater are the most likely sources of allochthonous DOC Our results suggest that DOC cycling in the deep Med Sea is dynamic and support the idea that a substantial fraction (up to 45%) of what has traditionally been defined as "refractory" DOC imported from the Atlantic Ocean, can be removed on temporal scales of <126 y, thereby opening intriguing questions about deep sea DOC cycling.

Studies to determine the chemical nature of oceanic DOM have been impeded by the lack of efficient and non-fractioning methods to recover oceanic DOM. Here, a DOM fraction (similar to 40 to 86% recovery) was isolated using reverse osmosis/electrodialysis (RD/ED) and analyzed by solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Samples were obtained from biogeochemically distinct environments: photobleached surface gyre, productive coastal upwelling zone, oxygen minimum, North Atlantic Deep Water, and North Pacific Deep Water. A ubiquitous 'background' refractory carbon pool was apparent throughout the ocean and dominated in the deep Pacific Ocean. Advanced NMR spectral editing revealed that condensed aromatic and quaternary anomeric carbons contribute to this deep refractory DOC pool, the quaternary anomeric carbons being a newly identified and potentially important component of bio-refractory carbohydrate-like carbon. Additionally, our results support the multi-pool (e.g. 3-pool: labile, semi-labile, and refractory) conceptual model of marine DOM biogeochemistry. Surface samples, hypothesized to be enriched in labile and semilabile DOM, were enriched in carbohydrate-like material consistent with prior studies. High carboxyl signals in the deep Pacific support the hypothesis that a major fraction of the refractory pool consists of carboxyl-rich alicydic molecules (CRAM). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conservation of dissolved organic matter molecular composition during mixing of the deep water masses of the northeast Atlantic Ocean	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Characterizing the composition of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is important for gaining insight into its role in oceanic biogeochemical cycles. Using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we analyzed the molecular composition of solid phase extracted (SPE) DOM from the northeast Atlantic to investigate the specificity of the DOM pool of the individual major water masses of the North Atlantic. All 272 measured samples from depths ranging from 87 to 5609 m and latitudes from 24 degrees N to 68 degrees N shared 96% similarity (on a Bray-Curtis scale) in their DOM composition. Small variations between subsurface and deep samples and among latitudinal groupings were identified, but overall, water mass specific SPE-DOM composition was not apparent. A strong correlation between a calculated degradation index and water mass age indicates variability in portions of the DOM pool, and ocean-scale differences were observed between the North Atlantic and deep North Pacific. However, within the deep northeast Atlantic, conservative mixing primarily drives the molecular composition of SPE-DOM. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Stubbins, A; Dittmar, T				Stubbins, Aron; Dittmar, Thorsten			Illuminating the deep: Molecular signatures of photochemical alteration of dissolved organic matter from North Atlantic Deep Water	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Duplicate, filtered samples of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) were irradiated for 28 days in a solar simulator. Duplicate dark controls were placed alongside the irradiated samples. After 28 days, samples were extensively photo-degraded based upon colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photo-bleaching (>95%). Samples were solid phase extracted using PPL resin to isolate, concentrate and desalt the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the samples. Ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) enabled 3024 molecular formulas to be identified in the dark control. Photo-degradation decreased molecular diversity, with 2402 formulas assigned post-irradiation. Molecular formulas were classified based upon their photo-lability as 1) photo-resistant; 2) photo-labile; and, 3) photo-produced. Photo-resistant DOM made up 73% of all formulas and was dominated by highly unsaturated molecular signatures consistent with carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules, suggesting that these apparently bio-refractory compounds may also survive multiple passages through sunlit surface waters and thus accumulate for timeframes exceeding ocean ventilation. Photo-labile DOM was enriched in low molecular weight formulas, aromatic molecular formulas, and sulfur and phosphorous containing formulas. Compounds containing both sulfur and nitrogen were particularly photo-labile and may represent an underappreciated component of the photo-reactive CDOM pool. Photo-produced DOM was enriched in higher molecular weight formulas, as well as aliphatic and peptide formulas. Molecular formulas are indexed by their photo-lability classification in the supplementary information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AltSIO was previously found to consume an equivalent magnitude of surface coastal marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as diverse bacterial assemblages (Pedler et al., 2014). In this study, we sought to investigate the potential of AltSIO to alter the chemical composition of marine DOC by characterizing its capacity to metabolize a broad suite of environmentally relevant model substrates. Results showed that AltSIO had a particularly broad capacity to degrade carbohydrates relative to other marine bacteria characterized as generalist heterotrophs. Growth in seawater incubations amended with model neutral sugars and radiolabeled substrates showed that AltSIO preferentially utilized la-galactose and disaccharides, but showed little to no biomass incorporation or respiration of D-glucose. Lastly, analysis of ambient dissolved organic matter (DOM) from time-course mesocosms by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry showed that both AltSIO grown in pure culture and a mixed bacterial community significantly altered ambient DOM, yet the alteration appeared uniform across chemical classes. for both treatments. This study provides insight into the physiological mechanisms of a globally distributed generalist bacterial taxon that has the capacity to significantly alter the geochemistry of marine DOM.

JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Field campaigns and an incubation experiment were conducted to evaluate the sources of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in black water spots in highly polluted regions of the Chinese Lake Taihu. A significant positive correlation (p < 0.0001) was found between chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and the CDOM absorption coefficient a(350), indicating that algae degradation was likely the primary source of CDOM in black waters. This is supported by our field results that Chl-a, a(350) and the spectral slope ratio (S-R) were significantly higher in the black water samples than in the regular samples (p < 0.001). Our incubation experiment further substantiated the primary significance of biological CDOM source where a(350) increased with decreasing Chl-a concentrations. After seven days' incubation, a 72.2% decrease and a 74.9% increase were recorded for Chl-a and a(350), respectively, relative to the initial values. Parallel factor analysis identified five fluorescent components. The maximal fluorescence intensity (F-max) of tryptophan-like Cl and microbial humic-like C3 of black water samples was significantly higher than in the regular water samples (p < 0.0005). This is consistent with incubation experiment results showing a rapid increase in F-max. of the two components, emphasizing the priority of the in situ biological CDOM source in black water spots.

J	Phong, DD; Hur, J				Phong, Diep Dinh; Hur, Jin			Insight into photocatalytic degradation of dissolved organic matter in UVA/TiO2 systems revealed by fluorescence EEM-PARAFAC	WATER RESEARCH												Photocatalytic degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) using TiO2 as a catalyst and UVA as a light source was examined under various experimental settings with different TiO2 doses, solution pH, and the light intensities. The changes in UV absorbance and fluorescence with the irradiation time followed a pseudo-first order model much better than those of dissolved organic carbon. In general, the degradation rates were increased by higher TiO(2)doses and light intensities. However, the exact photocatalytic responses of DOM to the irradiation were affected by many other factors such as aggregation of TiO2, light scattering, hydroxyl radicals produced, and DOM sorption on TiO2. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed that the DOM changes in fluorescence could be described by the combinations of four dissimilar components including one protein-like, two humic-like, and one terrestrial humic-like components, each of which followed well the pseudo-first order model. The photocatalytic degradation rates were higher for protein-like versus humic-like component, whereas the opposite order was displayed for the degradation rates in the absence of TiO2, suggesting different dominant mechanisms operating between the systems with and without TiO2. Our results based on EEM-PARAFAC provided new insights into the underlying mechanisms associated with the photocatalytic degradation of DOM as well as the potential environmental impact of the treated water. This study demonstrated a successful application of EEM-PARAFAC for photocatalytic systems via directly comparing the kinetic rates of the individual DOM components with different compositions.

Controlled Burning of Forest Detritus Altering Spectroscopic Characteristics and Chlorine Reactivity of Dissolved Organic Matter: Effects of Temperature and Oxygen Availability	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Forest fires occur with increasing frequency and severity in the western United States, potentially altering the chemistry and quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors exported from forested watersheds. However, little is known concerning effects of the fire triangle (heat, oxygen, and fuel) on DOM alteration. Using detritus from Pinus ponderosa and Abies concolor (dominant species in forests in the western United States), we prepared DOM from unburned and burned detritus under hypoxic (pyrolysis) and oxic conditions (thermal oxidation) at 250 and 400 degrees C. DOM characteristics and chlorine reactivity were evaluated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and chlorination-based DBP formation potential tests. Spectroscopic results suggest that burned-detritus extracts had lower molecular weight (reflected by increased E2:E3 and fluorescence index) and divergent aromaticity (reflected by SUVA(254)) depending on oxygen availability. Temperature and oxygen availability interacted to alter the chlorine reactivity of fire-affected DOM. Increasing temperature from 50 to 400 degrees C resulted in decreased reactivities for trihalomethane and chloral hydrate formation and divergent reactivities for haloacetonitrile formation (unchanged for pyrolysis and increased for oxidation) and haloketone formation (increased for pyrolysis and decreased for oxidation). We demonstrate that DBP precursors in fire-affected forest detritus are highly dependent on temperature and oxygen availability.

J	Longnecker, K				Longnecker, Krista			Dissolved organic matter in newly formed sea ice and surface seawater	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Changes in sea ice in the Arctic will have ramifications on regional and global carbon cycling. Research to date has primarily focused on the regional impacts to biological activity and global impacts on atmospheric processes. The current project considers the molecular-level composition of organic carbon within sea ice compared to the organic matter in seawater. The project revealed that the composition of organic matter within sea ice was more variable than the composition of organic matter within the surface ocean. Furthermore, sea ice samples presented two distinct patterns in the composition of organic matter with a portion of the sea ice samples containing protein-like organic matter. Yet, the samples were collected in the early winter period when little biological activity is expected. Thus, one hypothesis is that physical processes acting during the formation of sea ice selectively transferred organic matter from seawater into sea ice. The present project expands our understanding of dissolved organic matter in sea ice and surface seawater and thereby increases our knowledge of carbon cycling in polar regions.

The first step in the production of salmonids takes place in land-based aquacultures. However, the effects of the discharge from these aquacultures on stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) content, molecular composition and degradability are unknown. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the inputs of anthropogenic DOM from land-based aquaculture to the predominantly pristine river systems of North Patagonia. We hypothesized, that i) DOM exported from land-based aquaculture mainly consists of protein-like fluorescence (tyrosine and tryptophan) released from fish feces and food remains, and that ii) this DOM is highly degradable and therefore rapidly turned-over within the receiving streams. In the North Patagonian region we conducted a screening of ten land-based aquacultures and an intensive sampling campaign for one aquaculture. This was combined with longitudinal transects and a degradation experiment in order to couple the composition of DOM exported from land-based aquacultures to its degradability in streams. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration by high-temperature catalytic oxidation and DOM composition by fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis. In the effluent of the ten screened aquacultures and in the repeated sampling of one aquaculture, we consistently found an increase of DOC concentrations and a dominance of protein-like fluorescence. The protein-like fluorescence rapidly disappeared downstream of the aquacultures, and in the degradation experiment. 21% of the DOC export from the repeatedly sampled aquaculture resulted from food addition and 76% from fish production. We conclude that large amounts of degradable DOM are exported from land-based aquacultures. This probably has strong effects on the ecological structure and function of North Patagonian streams, and similarly affected streams worldwide. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Feng, GZ; Chu, HQ; Dong, BZ				Feng, Guizhen; Chu, Huaqiang; Dong, Bingzhi			Characterizing dissolved organic matter fouling of nanofiltration membranes and evaluating effects of naproxen retention	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Nanofiltration (NF) membrane fouling caused by two types of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM), namely Qingcaosha reservoir (QCS) DOM and Taihu Lake (TH) DOM, on naproxen (NPX) retention, were assessed. The results indicated that NPX retention could be interpreted with respect to the DOM molecular weights (MW) and the fouling characteristics. Organics with medium- and low-MW, e.g. less than 10kDa, significantly affected NPX retention and resulted in membrane fouling. DOMs with medium MW (1.5-10kDa) mainly had strong hydrophobic characteristics, and adhered well to the NF membrane surface to form a fouling layer, which altered the hydrophobicity and negative charge of the membrane surface. The hydrophobicity and electronegativity of the adhered DOM fouling layer was responsible for the decreased membrane flux and the change in NPX retention. TH DOM contained more hydrophobic organics with MW 1.5-10kDa than QCS DOM, and the cohesion free energy and adhesion free energy between the membrane and foulants were more negative for TH DOM, which caused more severe membrane fouling. The surface free energy between membranes and foulants is a useful parameter for membrane fouling analysis, and a mechanism of influencing NPX retention in the presence of DOM was proposed. The increased NPX removal by QCS DOM-fouled membrane was mainly attributed to electrostatic repulsion, whereas the decreased NPX rejection by TH DOM-fouled membrane was mainly attributed to cake-enhanced concentration polarization.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC 11	2015	56	11					2835	2847		10.1080/19443994.2014.964330						WOS:000364207800006

This study examined the concentration, chemical composition and bioavailability of DOM in two subterranean estuaries of southwest Taiwan with contrasting pollution degrees, using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy-parallel factor analysis. The DOC and fluorescent components were non-conservative and very dynamic in both subterranean estuaries. In the less-polluted Longquanwan (LQW) subterranean estuary, the levels of DOC and fluorescence components were generally low, and the humic-like fluorescent components received significant additions during mixing between freshwater and seawater. In the highly-polluted Sizihwan (SZW) subterranean estuary, the DOC and fluorescence intensities were high in the freshwater end but were subject to active additions and removals during estuarine mixing. The humification index (HIX) and the autochthonous index (BIX) were 1.0-13.4 and 0.73-1.01 for all groundwater samples. The HIX were elevated in the low-to-mid salinity zone of the LQW subterranean estuary in March and increased with salinity in the SZW subterranean estuary. The BIX decreased with salinity in both subterranean estuaries. These results suggested that subterranean estuaries are important zones where both the level and the chemical composition of groundwater DOM change notably. In addition, the DOC, fluorescent intensities, HIX and BIX in groundwater showed limited changes in microbial incubation experiments (<20%) in 28 days, which suggested low bioavailability of groundwater DOM.

The results indicated that 3D-EEM spectra of DOM-WS showed four different fluorophores: humic-like, visible fulvic-like, UV fulvic-like and protein-like substances. It is interesting that DOM-WS can obviously enhance the fluorescence intensity of Eu(III)-thenoyltrifluoroacetone-cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide system. On the basis of this study, a new fluorescence method for the determination of trace amounts of Eu(III) was developed. Under the optimal conditions, the enhanced fluorescence intensity was in proportion to the concentration of Eu(III) in the range of 8.0 x 10(-8)-8.0 x 10(-7) mol/L.

Optical characteristics of the colored dissolved organic matter on the East Siberian shelf	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												This work is based on the results of a cruise of the R/V Akademik Lavrent'ev in September 2011 in the Laptev and East Siberian seas. The optical characteristics of one of the most characteristic components of the river runoff colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which intensely absorbs solar radiation in the short-wave spectrum range are analyzed. On the basis of experimental data, the possibility to use spectral characteristic not only for quantitative estimations but also for determination of the DOM composition in the waters of the East Siberian shelf is shown.																	1028-334X	1531-8354				DEC	2015	465	2					1293	1296		10.1134/S1028334X15120120						WOS:000368182900019

The rate of furfuryl alcohol degradation under UV irradiation was found to be the highest when the anatase to rutile ratio was 70:30; the rate did not linearly increase as a function of the NF film thickness, mainly due to diffusion limitation. Even after eight repeated cycles, it showed only a marginal reduction in the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of cimetidine. The effects of pH and different organic matter characteristics on the photodegradation of cimetidine (CMT), propranolol (PRP), and carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated. The pH-dependence of the photocatalytic degradation rates of PRP was explained by electrostatic interactions between the selected compounds and the surface of TiO2 NFs. The degradation rates of CMT showed the following order: deionized water > L-tyrosine > secondary wastewater effluent (effluent organic matter) > Suwannee River natural organic matter, demonstrating that the characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) can affect the photodegradation of CMT. Photodegradation of CBZ was affected by the presence of DOM, and no significant change was observed between different DOM characteristics. These findings suggest that the removal of CMT, PRP, and CBZ during photocatalytic oxidation using SI TiO2 NFs is affected by the presence of DOM and/or pH, which should be importantly considered for practical applications.

Watershed geomorphology and land use can drive the quality and reactivity of DOM. Determining the molecular composition of riverine DOM is essential for understanding its source, mobility and fate across landscapes. In this study, DOM from the main stem of 10 global rivers covering a wide climatic range and land use features was molecularly characterized via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). FT-ICR mass spectral data revealed an overall similarity in molecular components among the rivers. However, when focusing specifically on the contribution of nonoxygen heteroatornic molecular formulas (CHON, CHOS, CHOP, etc.) to the bulk molecular signature, patterns relating DOM composition and watershed land use became apparent. Greater abundances of N- and S-containing molecular formulas were identified as unique to rivers influenced by anthropogenic inputs, whereas rivers with primarily forested watersheds had DOM signatures relatively depleted in heteroatomic content. A strong correlation between cropland cover and dissolved black nitrogen was established when focusing specifically on the pyrogenic class of compounds. This study demonstrated how changes in land use directly affect downstream DOM quality and could impact C and nutrient cycling on a global scale.

Photoproduction by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one of its main sources, but the structures responsible for this production remain unknown. Here, a series of substituted phenol model compounds are examined to test whether these structures could act as a source of (OH)-O-center dot. We find that many of these compounds do produce (OH)-O-center dot with quantum yields (Phi) ranging from similar to 10(-4) to similar to 10(-2). In particular, two compounds that have hydroxy groups and carboxyl groups in a para relationship (4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) exhibit relatively high Phi values, similar to 10(-2). For 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, the formation of (OH)-O-center dot was confirmed through the use of competition kinetics and reaction with methane. We conclude that these types of structures, which may derive from polyphenolic source materials such as lignins, tannins, and humic substances, could be an important source of (OH)-O-center dot in natural waters.																	2328-8930					DEC	2015	2	12					352	356		10.1021/acs.estlett.5b00294						WOS:000366244100004

A rapid increase in TOC concentration from 50.93 to 127.40 mg L-1 is observed during the Cr(VI) removal process by activated sludge in the pH range of 2-9. Removal efficiencies of Cr(VI) by either activated sludge or DOM greatly decreased with the increasing initial pH. Kinetics of Cr(VI) removal by activated sludge indicate that both biosorption and bioreduction are involved in the Cr(VI) removal. Cr(VI) removal by DOM is slow in dark, but it is greatly enhanced when UV light is applied. The first-order constant increases from 0.0033 (in dark) to 0.079 min(-1) (UV illumination) at pH 2.0 and 1068 mg L-1 DOM. The enhancement of Cr(VI) reduction is due to the generation of the reactive intermediates such as O-2(center dot-) and DOM* as DOM absorbed light energy, which plays important roles in the reduction of Cr(VI).																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2015	22	23					18487	18494		10.1007/s11356-015-5182-3						WOS:000365816000017	26300355

This work aimed to evaluate the effect of different N fertilizer and irrigation water types on soil C and N mineralization. The farmland experiment was conducted with three types of N fertilizer (urea, ammonium sulfate, and slow-release urea) and drip irrigation with two types of water (groundwater and reclaimed water) for a summer maize-winter wheat crop rotation. Soil samples were collected from the experimental farmland for incubation experiments. The results showed that the average cumulative mineralization of soil C (incubation 20 days) and N (incubation 14 weeks) in different treatments ranged from 73.50 to 91.37 mg kg(-1) and 52.65 to 64.04 mg kg(-1), respectively. N fertilization significantly increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil organic nitrogen (SON) contents in the soils, but N fertilizer and irrigation water types had no significant influence on them. Correspondingly, N fertilization significantly enhanced the mineralization of C by 14.14-21.22 % and N by 15.81-22.16 % in soils but no significant difference among different N fertilizer types. Compared with groundwater, reclaimed water irrigation enhanced the mineralization of C by 3.33 % and N by 1.01 %, but the difference was not statistically significant. The cumulative mineralization of C and N in soils after DOM removal average significantly decreased 9.83 and 14.83 %, respectively, which indicates that DOM plays an important role in soil C and N mineralization. Our results indicate that inorganic N fertilization promotes soil C and N mineralization, which may inevitably aggravate global warning. Reclaimed water irrigation had similar influence on soil C and N mineralization as groundwater irrigation; thus, we recommend irrigation with reclaimed water in water shortage areas.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	2015	226	12							396	10.1007/s11270-015-2667-0						WOS:000365492600017

High molecular weight dissolved organic matter enrichment selects for methylotrophs in dilution to extinction cultures	ISME JOURNAL												The role of bacterioplankton in the cycling of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is central to the carbon and energy balance in the ocean, yet there are few model organisms available to investigate the genes, metabolic pathways, and biochemical mechanisms involved in the degradation of this globally important carbon pool. To obtain microbial isolates capable of degrading semi-labile DOM for growth, we conducted dilution to extinction cultivation experiments using seawater enriched with high molecular weight (HMW) DOM. In total, 93 isolates were obtained. Amendments using HMW DOM to increase the dissolved organic carbon concentration 4x (280 mu M) or 10x (700 mu M) the ocean surface water concentrations yielded positive growth in 4-6% of replicate dilutions, whereas <1% scored positive for growth in non-DOM-amended controls. The majority (71%) of isolates displayed a distinct increase in cell yields when grown in increasing concentrations of HMW DOM. Whole-genome sequencing was used to screen the culture collection for purity and to determine the phylogenetic identity of the isolates. Eleven percent of the isolates belonged to the gammaproteobacteria including Alteromonadales (the SAR92 clade) and Vibrio. Surprisingly, 85% of isolates belonged to the methylotrophic OM43 clade of betaproteobacteria, bacteria thought to metabolically specialize in degrading C1 compounds. Growth of these isolates on methanol confirmed their methylotrophic phenotype. Our results indicate that dilution to extinction cultivation enrichede with natural sources of organic substrates has a potential to reveal the previously unsuspected relationships between naturally occurring organic nutrients and the microorganisms that consume them.																	1751-7362	1751-7370				DEC	2015	9	12					2725	2739		10.1038/ismej.2015.68						WOS:000365094400015	25978545

Here, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) forms with four different molecular weights were used to surface functionalize iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) to promote their attachment onto the cells by electrostatic interaction. We also investigated the effect of suspended solids and natural organic matter (NOM), which are normally found in fish farm water, on the magnetic seeding process. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic mobility measurement were used to confirm the successful IONP functionalization by PDDA. For particle imaging, both electron and optical microscopes were used to monitor the IONP attachment on microalgal cells. For low particle-to-cell ratios of 10,000:1 or below, the effects of NOM and suspended solids on magnetophoretic separation of microalgae were obvious, with a cell separation efficiency that rarely exceeded 20%. For a particle-to-cell ratio in the intermediate range, the formation of large clusters composed of IONPs-suspended solids/NOM-microalgal cells (which were responsive to the magnetic field) instead of the independent formation of IONPs-suspended solids and/or IONPs-NOM entities is the main reason for minimum interference of suspended solids and NOM on the magnetophoretic separation. For a particle-to-cell ratio of 20,000 or higher (equivalent to 100 mg/L of IONPs), it was possible to achieve 98% separation efficiency even under the strong effects of suspended solids and NOM.

However, the molecular signature of DOM associated with such optical parameters remains poorly defined. The Florida coastal Everglades is a subtropical wetland with diverse vegetation (e.g., sawgrass prairies, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows) and DOM sources (e.g., terrestrial, microbial, and marine). As such, the Everglades is an excellent model system from which to draw samples of diverse origin and composition to allow classically-defined optical properties to be linked to molecular properties of the DOM pool. We characterized a suite of seasonally- and spatially-collected DOM samples using optical measurements (EEM-PARAFAC, SUVA254, S275-295, S350-400, SR, FI, freshness index, and HIX) and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Spearman's rank correlations between FTICR-MS signal intensities of individual molecular formulae and optical properties determined which molecular formulae were associated with each PARAFAC component and optical index. The molecular families that tracked with the optical indices were generally in agreement with conventional biogeochemical interpretations. Therefore, although they represent only a small portion of the bulk DOM pool, absorbance, and fluorescence measurements appear to be appropriate proxies for the aquatic cycling of both optically-active and associated optically-inactive DOM in coastal wetlands.

However, the sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the connection of its molecular-level processing to pore water chemistry and redox conditions in these ecosystems are still not well understood. We studied the cycling of DOM in the STE of an intertidal sandy beach of the North Sea on spatial and seasonal scales. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify thousands of DOM molecular formulae. These data were interpreted in the context of inorganic pore water chemistry, stable carbon isotope composition of solid-phase extracted (SPE) DOM and chemical tracers for bioavailable (dissolved carbohydrates, DCHOs) as well as biorefractory DOM (dissolved black carbon, DBC). Numerical modelling was used to estimate pore water residence times indicating relatively young pore water in the upper saline plume (USP, <4 years) and decades-old groundwater in the freshwater discharge tube. The detected levels of dissolved Fe and ammonium in the USP at sediment depths exceeding 50 cm demonstrated suboxic conditions. Statistical analyses revealed complex biotic and abiotic DOM processing apart from conservative mixing of marine and terrestrial endmembers. We propose that the input of bioavailable marine and terrestrial DOM, such as DCHOs, by percolating seawater and meteoric groundwater and its degradation by microbes caused oxygen depletion favoring Fe oxide/hydroxide reduction. In the freshwater discharge tube, the presence of highly aromatic compounds, DBC, and C-13-depleted SPE-DOM indicated the intrusion of meteoric groundwater containing terrestrial DOM. The discharge of this groundwater appears to be a significant source of nutrients (e.g., ammonium) and biorefractory, e.g. combustion-derived, DOM to the adjacent water column. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Three terrestrial humic-like components (C1, C2 and C3) and one autochthonous protein-like component (C4) were identified. As for seasonal variations, CDOM displayed the following order on the whole: summer > spring > autumn. The Cl, C2 and C3 components were mainly dominated by terrestrial inputs and their spatial distributions and temporal variations also can be influenced by primary productivity of phytoplankton, microbial activities and photobleaching. C4 was produced by phytoplankton and microorganisms and consumed by marine bacteria, and besides its distribution was attributed to the influence of riverine inputs. Terrestrial inputs were the dominant sources of CDOM in the SYS and ECS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of pH on fluorescent dissolved organic matter photo-degradation	WATER RESEARCH												A novel semi-continuous excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and absorbance monitoring system has been developed. Full EEMs were collected simultaneously with absorbance spectra every 20 min during 24 h solar-simulated irradiation experiments, and the kinetic change of fluorescence of Suwannee River natural organic matter IHSS standard material (SRNOM) at various pH values was investigated. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was then used to isolate the photo-labile and pH-influenced fluorescent components of SRNOM. Kinetic analysis showed increasing rates of fluorescence loss with increasing pH. This has significant implications for the photo-degradation of dissolved natural organic matter during estuarine mixing, when large increases of pH are common. The influence of pH on fluorescence and photo-degradation kinetics emphasizes the need for pH to be monitored and accurately controlled during laboratory experiments. It is also highly recommended that when constructing PARAFAC models or monitoring changes in fluorescence data between samples of different origins, that the pH be held constant to remove any potential artifacts or misinterpretation of data.

Tracking changes in the optical properties and molecular composition of dissolved organic matter during drinking water production	WATER RESEARCH												Absorbance, 3D fluorescence and ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) were used to explain patterns in the removal of chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM and FDOM) at the molecular level during drinking water production at four large drinking water treatment plants in Sweden. When dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal was low, shifts in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition could not be detected with commonly used DOG-normalized parameters (e.g. specific UV254 absorbance SUVA), but was clearly observed by using differential absorbance and fluorescence or ESI-FT-ICR-MS. In addition, we took a novel approach by identifying how optical parameters were correlated to the elemental composition of DOM by using rank correlation to connect optical properties to chemical formulas assigned to mass peaks from FT-ICR-MS analyses. Coagulation treatment selectively removed FDOM at longer emission wavelengths (450-600 nm), which significantly correlated with chemical formulas containing oxidized carbon (average carbon oxidation state >= 0), low hydrogen to carbon ratios (H/C: average +/- SD = 0.83 +/- 0.13), and abundant oxygen-containing functional groups (O/C = 0.62 +/- 0.10). Slow sand filtration was less efficient in removing DOM, yet selectively targeted FDOM at shorter emission wavelengths (between 300 and 450 nm), which commonly represents algal rather than terrestrial sources. This shorter wavelength FDOM correlated with chemical formulas containing reduced carbon (average carbon oxidation state <= 0), with relatively few carbon-carbon double bonds (H/C = 1.32 +/- 0.16) and less oxygen per carbon (O/C = 0.43 +/- 0.10) than those removed during coagulation. By coupling optical approaches with FT-ICR-MS to characterize DOM, we were for the first time able to confirm the molecular composition of absorbing and fluorescing DOM selectively targeted during drinking water treatment.

The results showed that the compost-derived DOM was comprised of protein- and humic-like species. The low apparent molecule weight (AMW) protein-like components were enriched in CCH3 and N-C=O, and showed more bioreactivity compared with the high AMW counterpart. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic protein-like components both consisted of CCH3 and N-C=0. However, the relatively hydrophilic protein-like components were more easily consumed. As to the humic-like species, the relatively hydrophilic components were slightly larger than the relatively hydrophobic ones. The high AMW and relatively hydrophilic humic-like components were high in C-H, OCH3, N-C=O, N-H, COO, O-H and aromatic C. The low AMW and relatively hydrophobic humic-like components were enriched in CCH3 and N-C=0, and were easily biodegraded during composting. 2D hetero-spectral correlation spectra techniques enhance the characterization of DOM and provide a promising way to elucidate the environmental behaviors of DOM.

In the northern temperate region, agriculture also strongly affects the amount and molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which constitutes the main vector of carbon transport from soils to fluvial networks and to the sea, and is involved in a large variety of biogeochemical processes. Here, we provide first evidence about the wider occurrence of agricultural impacts on the concentration and composition of fluvial DOM across climate zones of the northern and southern hemispheres. Both extensive and intensive farming altered fluvial DOM towards a more microbial and less plant-derived composition. Moreover, intensive farming significantly increased dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations. The DOM composition change and DON concentration increase differed among climate zones and could be related to the intensity of current and historical nitrogen fertilizer use. As a result of agriculture intensification, increased DON concentrations and a more microbial-like DOM composition likely will enhance the reactivity of catchment DOM emissions, thereby fuelling the biogeochemical processing in fluvial networks, and resulting in higher ecosystem productivity and CO2 outgassing.

This paper compared the constitution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the two waters based on XAD resins isolation, ultrafiltration fractionation, and the disinfection by-product formation potential of each fraction. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV254, trihalomethanes, and nitrogenous disinfection by-product (N-DBP) formation potential of the raw water from the Yellow River were higher than those from the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The molecular weight (MW)<1kDa fraction contained the most DOM and dominated the major THM formation potential (THMFP) and N-DBP formation potential (N-DBPFP) in both waters. The hydrophilic fraction possessed the highest proportion in the Yellow River water, while the transphilic fraction was predominant in the Danjiangkou Reservoir water. In both waters, the hydrophobic fraction owned the highest THMFP and the hydrophilic fraction contained the highest N-DBPFP. Meanwhile, the molecular weight (MW)<1kDa and hydrophilic fractions contributed more bromated THMFP than the other fractions. Very toxic bromoform, bromochloroacetonitrile, and dibromoacetonitrile were only detected in DOM fractions from the Yellow River water. Therefore, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic organic compounds with low MW in both raw waters and bromide in Yellow River water should receive attention during the upgrading and reforming of drinking water treatment processes for adapting waters with different qualities in the water-receiving areas of SNWDP.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV 6	2015	56	6					1689	1697		10.1080/19443994.2014.953211						WOS:000362832300027

Photochemical Production of Singlet Oxygen from Dissolved Organic Matter in Ice	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) is a ubiquitous component of natural waters and an important photosensitizer. A variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be produced from DOM photochemistry, including singlet oxygen, O-1(2). Recently, it has been determined that humic-like substances and unknown organic chromophores are significant contributors to sunlight absorption in snowpack; however, DOM photochemistry in snow/ice has received little attention in the literature. We recently showed that DOM plays an important role in indirect photolysis processes in ice, producing ROS and leading to the efficient photodegradation of a probe hydrophobic organic pollutant, aldrin.(1) ROS scavenger experiments indicated that O-1(2) played a significant role in the indirect photodegradation of aldrin. Here we quantitatively examine O-1(2) photochemically produced from DOM in frozen and liquid aqueous solutions. Steady-state O-1(2) production is enhanced up to nearly 1000 times in frozen DOM samples compared to liquid samples. O-1(2) production is dependent on the concentration of DOM, but the nature of the DOM source (terrestrial vs microbial) does not have a significant effect on O-1(2) production in liquid or frozen samples, with different source types producing similar steady-state concentrations of O-1(2). The temperature of frozen samples also has a significant effect on steady-state O-1(2) production in the range of 228-262 K, with colder samples producing more steady-state O-1(2). The large enhancement in O-1(2) in frozen samples suggests that it may play a significant role in the photochemical processes that occur in snow and ice, and DOM could be a significant, but to date poorly understood, oxidant source in snow and ice.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 3	2015	49	21					12808	12815		10.1021/acs.est.5b03600						WOS:000364355300024	26460930

Limnology of the Green Lakes Valley: phytoplankton ecology and dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry at a long-term ecological research site	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Surface waters are the lowest points in the landscape, and therefore serve as excellent integrators and indicators of changes taking place in the surrounding terrestrial and atmospheric environment. Aims: Here we synthesise the findings of limnological studies conducted during the past 15 years in streams and lakes in the Green Lakes Valley, which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Site. Methods: The importance of these studies is discussed in the context of aquatic ecosystems as indicators, integrators, and regulators of environmental change. Specifically, investigations into climatic, hydrologic, and nutrient controls on present-day phytoplankton, and historical diatom, community composition in the alpine lake, Green Lake 4, are reviewed. In addition, studies of spatial and temporal patterns in dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry and reactive transport modelling that have taken place in the Green Lakes Valley are highlighted. Results and conclusions: The findings of these studies identify specific shifts in algal community composition and DOM biogeochemistry that are indicative of changing environmental conditions and provide a framework for detecting future environmental change in the Green Lakes Valley and in other alpine watersheds. Moreover, the studies summarised here demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring programmes such as the LTER programme.

Assessing the potential impacts of declining Arctic sea ice cover on the photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES					2nd International Conference on Arctic Research Planning	NOV 10-12, 2005	Copenhagen, DENMARK					A warming and shifting climate in the Arctic has led to significant declines in sea ice over the last several decades. Although these changes in sea ice cover are well documented, large uncertainties remain in how associated increases in solar radiation transmitted to the underlying ocean water column will impact heating, biological, and biogeochemical processes in the Arctic Ocean. In this study, six under-ice marine, two ice-free marine, and two ice-free terrestrially influenced water samples were irradiated using a solar simulator for 72 h (representing similar to 10 days of ambient sunlight) to investigate dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics from the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Solar irradiation caused chromophoric DOM (CDOM) light absorption at 254nm to decrease by 48 to 63%. An overall loss in total DOM fluorescence intensity was also observed at the end of all experiments, and each of six components identified by parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis was shown to be photoreactive in at least one experiment. Fluorescent DOM (FDOM) also indicated that the majority of DOM in under-ice and ice-free marine waters was likely algal-derived. Measurable changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were only observed for sites influenced by riverine runoff. Losses of CDOM absorbance at shorter wavelengths suggest that the beneficial UV protection currently received by marine organisms may decline with the increased light transmittance associated with sea ice melt ponding and overall reductions of sea ice. Our FDOM analyses demonstrate that DOM irrespective of source was susceptible to photobleaching. Additionally, our findings suggest that photodegradation of CDOM in under-ice waters is not currently a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e., we did not observe systematic DOC loss). However, increases in primary production and terrestrial freshwater export expected under future climate change scenarios may cause an increase in CDOM quantity and shift in quality throughout Arctic Ocean surface waters. As Arctic temperatures continue to warm and summer sea ice further declines, examination of the resulting enhanced photodegradation processes and their impacts on the interplay between primary production, carbon cycling, and surface ocean heating processes will be paramount.																	2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV	2015	120	11					2326	2344		10.1002/2015JG003052						WOS:000368908700015

Hot hydrothermal circulation may facilitate the degradation of otherwise un-reactive dissolved organic matter, playing an important role in the long-term global carbon cycle. The oldest, most recalcitrant forms of DOC, which make up most of oceanic DOC, can be recovered by solid-phase extraction. Here we present measurements of solid-phase extractable DOC from samples collected between 2009 and 2013 at seven vent sites in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans, along with magnesium concentrations, a conservative tracer of water circulation through hydrothermal systems. We find that magnesium and solid-phase extractable DOC concentrations are correlated, suggesting that solid-phase extractable DOC is almost entirely lost from solution through mineralization or deposition during circulation through hydrothermal vents with fluid temperatures of 212-401 degrees C. In laboratory experiments, where we heated samples to 380 degrees C for four days, we found a similar removal efficiency. We conclude that thermal degradation alone can account for the loss of solid-phase extractable DOC in natural hydrothermal systems, and that its maximum lifetime is constrained by the timescale of hydrothermal cycling, at about 40 million years(3).

Terrestrial dissolved organic matter supports growth and reproduction of Daphnia magna when algae are limiting	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We experimentally show that Daphnia magna can use terrestrial-derived dissolved organic matter (t-DOM) to support growth and reproduction when alternative food sources are limiting or absent. Unlike previous studies, we restricted available food to limiting algae (0.1 mg C L-1 of Scenedesmus obliquus, provided to all treatments) and bacteria (conditions were not sterile) by excluding heterotrophic protists and running our experiment in darkness to prevent algal growth. Daphnia receiving 10 mg t-DOC L-1 leached from either beech (Fagus sylvatica, t-DOMbeech) or hazel leaves (Corylus maxima, t-DOMhazel) had significantly higher juvenile growth rates and deposited larger clutch sizes across a range of realistic temperatures (15, 20, 25 degrees C) than Daphnia receiving no t-DOM, which failed to deposit eggs. Growth rates of t-DOM-supplied Daphnia were similar (0.10 +/- 0.01 d(-1)) and clutch sizes were low (<2 eggs female(-1)) across temperatures. Our experimental leachate additions mimic fresh t-DOM inputs in natural systems (e.g. during runoff or precipitation) and suggest that t-DOM and t-DOM-supported bacteria can supplement Daphnia growth and reproduction across a range of temperatures even when algae are strongly limiting. Low growth and reproduction rates, however, indicate that t-DOM based resources are unlikely to sustain Daphnia populations independently from sufficient algal contributions.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2015	37	6					1201	1209		10.1093/plankt/fbv083						WOS:000366936900011

K-doc values were obtained for most of the evaluated 33 HOCs, indicating the feasibility and applicability of the CF method in a multi-contaminant system. Significant positive correlations were observed between binding coefficients and octanol-water partition coefficients (K-ow) for organic halogen compounds, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (R-2 = 0.95, p < 0.05) and organic chlorine pesticides (OCP5) (methoxychlor excluded, R-2 = 0.82, p < 0.05). The positive correlations identified between the lgK(doc) and IgBCF (bioconcentration factor) for PBDEs and OCPs, as well as the negative correlation observed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), indicated that different binding or partition mechanisms between PAHs and organic halogen compounds exist. These differences further result in discriminative competition partitions of HOCs between DOM and organisms. Assuming that only freely dissolved HOCs are bioconcentrative, the results of DOM-influenced bioconcentration factor (BCFDOM) and DOM-influenced lowest observed effect level (LOELDOM) indicate that the ecological risk of HOCs is decreased by DOM.

J	D'Amario, SC; Xenopoulos, MA				D'Amario, Sarah C.; Xenopoulos, Marguerite A.			Linking dissolved carbon dioxide to dissolved organic matter quality in streams	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Streams are typically supersaturated with carbon dioxide (CO2) thus playing a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle. To further our knowledge on stream CO2 dynamics, we tested the linkages between dissolved CO2 and dissolved organic matter quality during two time periods (spring and summer). We sampled 48 streams in Ontario, Canada that represent a range of catchment cropland cover (2-80 %), nutrients, dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality. For both sampling periods, DOM composition (quality) was found to be an important predictor of CO2 concentration in streams, more so than DOC concentration. In general, the more complex terrestrially-derived DOM was associated with elevated CO2 levels whereas microbial-like DOM had a poor relationship with CO2. The DOM characteristics associated with increased CO2 levels were related to wetlands rather than croplands. Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) were also important predictors of CO2, however this relationship was not linear. Since the streams in the sampled network were of mixed land use, it appears that CO2 levels were affected by both land use types in a composite non-linear way. Overall, our findings suggest that DOM quality is a better predictor of stream CO2, however the relationship between DOM and CO2 is complicated by the presence of breakpoints in the data associated with non-linearity.																	0168-2563	1573-515X				NOV	2015	126	1-2					99	114		10.1007/s10533-015-0143-y						WOS:000365868400007

Non-conservative behavior of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) within a subterranean estuary	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The role of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in releasing fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) to the coastal ocean and the possibility of using FDOM as a proxy for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated in a subterranean estuary in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Turkey Point, Florida). FDOM was continuously monitored for three weeks in shallow beach groundwater and in the adjacent coastal ocean. Radon (Rn-222) was used as a natural groundwater tracer. FDOM and DOC correlated in groundwater and seawater samples, implying that FDOM may be a proxy of DOC in waters influenced by SGD. A mixing model using salinity as a seawater tracer revealed FDOM production in the high salinity region of the subterranean estuary. This production was probably a result of infiltration and transformation of labile marine organic matter in the beach sediments. The non-conservative FDOM behavior in this subterranean estuary differs from most surface estuaries where FDOM typically behaves conservatively. At the study site, fresh and saline SGD delivered about 1800 mg d(-1) of FDOM (quinine equivalents) to the coastal ocean per meter of shoreline. About 11% of this input was related to fresh SGD, while 89% were related to saline SGD resulting from FDOM production within the shallow aquifer. If these fluxes are representative of the Florida Gulf Coast, SGD-derived FDOM fluxes would be equivalent to at least 18% of the potential regional riverine FDOM inputs. To reduce uncertainties related to the scarcity of FDOM data, further investigations of river and groundwater FDOM inputs in Florida and elsewhere are necessary. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aqueous phase DOMS exhibited a More complex molecular composition than other complex mixtures investigated by far, in which there were totally 76 compound class species identified in a single mass spectrum. Refinery wastewater DOMs have lower values of double bond-equivalent (DBE), and O/C ratio than those of natural organic matter,(NOM) in fresh and marine waters. The organic phase DOM occupied the major TOC value, but was liable to be degraded in the biological process. Some humic-like substances presented in the aqueous DOM, were found resistant to the treatment processes by the ESI FT-ICR MS based semiquantitative results.																	0887-0624	1520-5029				NOV	2015	29	11					6956	6963		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b01446						WOS:000365462400010

The produced water that is treated and reused as boiler feedwater contains high concentration of silica and dissolved organic matter (DOM), and silica and carbon have been found to be principle components of steam generator and heat exchanger foulants. The interactions between silica and SAGD DOM were studied in this research to provide insight into possible fouling mechanisms and mitigation methods. The effects of physicochemical process parameters such as different types of organics, salts, and colloids in the silica-DOM co-precipitation are studied at different concentrations and pHs. In order to study the effects of all physicochemical process parameters at three different levels with a minimum number of experiments, Taguchi experimental design is employed. Analysis of variance is performed to evaluate the contribution of each parameter in the silica-DOM aggregation process. The study revealed that the rate of silica organic co-precipitation varies mainly with the nature of the organics. Further, at higher ionic strength and lower pH of the solution, an enhanced silica-organic aggregation is observed. Multivalent cationic salt is found to be a good coagulating agent to remove humic-like DOM fraction from SAGD produced water.																	0887-0624	1520-5029				NOV	2015	29	11					7465	7473		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b01223						WOS:000365462400064		
J	Quang, VL; Choi, I; Hur, J				Viet Ly Quang; Choi, Ilhwan; Hur, Jin			Tracking the behavior of different size fractions of dissolved organic matter in a full-scale advanced drinking water treatment plant	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this study, five different dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions, defined based on a size exclusion chromatography with simultaneous detection of organic carbon (OCD) and ultraviolet (UVD), were quantitatively tracked with a treatment train of coagulation/flocculation-sand filtration-ozonation-granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration in a full-scale advanced drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Five DOM samples including raw water were taken after each treatment process in the DWTP every month over the period of three years. A higher abundance of biopolymer (BP) fraction was found in the raw water during spring and winter than in the other seasons, suggesting an influence of algal bloom and/or meltwater on DOM composition. The greater extent of removal was observed upon the coagulation/flocculation for high-molecular-weight fractions including BP and humic substances (HS) and aromatic moieties, while lower sized fractions were preferentially removed by the GAC filtration. Ozone treatment produced the fraction of low-molecular-weight neutrals probably resulting from the breakdown of double-bonded carbon structures by ozone oxidation. Coagulation/flocculation was the only process that revealed significant effects of influent DOM composition on the treatment efficiency, as revealed by a high correlation between the DOM removal rate and the relative abundance of HS for the raw water. Our study demonstrated that SEC-OCD-UVD was successful in monitoring size-based DOM composition for the advanced DWTP, providing an insight into optimizing the treatment options and the operational conditions for the removal of particular fractions within the bulk DOM.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2015	22	22					18176	18184		10.1007/s11356-015-5040-3						WOS:000365423100084	26178836

The incorporated straw will naturally decompose and release the component of dissolved organic matter (DOM). At present, it lacks the research on straw humification behavior controlled by environmental factors and complexation effect between humification component and metal ions with fluorescence spectrometry in the representative region of loess. The fluorescence spectrometry was used to reveal the 3D-EEMs characteristics of DOM affected by temperatures and lead ions in the straw humification process, and the modified Stern-Volmer equation and Van' t Hoff equation were applied to indicate the complexation parameters and thermodynamic constants between lead ions and DOM. The results showed: the humification temperatures affected little on fluorescence peaks of DOM and no peaks were obviously found to appear or disappear from the 3D-EEMs results. The fluorescence intensity decreased gradually at higher temperatures and in the presence of lead ions, the quenching effect might work in the process. The binding ability was more significant between lead ions and visible fulvic-like component shown from modified Stern-Volmer equation, and the values of f revealed the complexation effect of lead ions and functional groups in DOM. Static quenching was the primary mechanism during the reaction process. The constants in Van' t Hoff equation suggested the reaction was spontaneous and endothermic, and the disordered degree and the complexity were relatively low in the reaction system. The 3D-EEMs were acceptable to illustrate the variation of DOM characteristics under different temperatures and in the presence of lead ions in the straw humification process.																	1000-0593					NOV	2015	35	11					3117	3122		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)11-3117-06						WOS:000364503600029

The environmental factors could change the speciation of heavy metals, plus to the complexity of soil system, and the transformation variation of speciation might occasional existed under similar conditions. At present, the different viewpoints of related issues are urgent to be investigated. The characteristics of DOM from straw humification were revealed with UV spectra, 3D-EEMs spectra and FTIR spectra, and the Tessier Sequential Extraction Procedure was used to study the speciation transformation behavior of lead affected by DOM. The linear relationship of the contents between DOC and lead bound to organic matter was indicated to further discuss the influence mechanism of lead speciation using FTIR. The results showed: the absorbance peak of DOM located in 229 nm in UV spectra, and the fluorescence peaks appeared around the regions of lambda(ex/em) = 250/350 nm, lambda(ex/em) = 250/450 nm and lambda(ex/em) = 330/450 ma, referred as UV fulvic-like fluorescence, and visible humic-like fluorescence, respectively. The dominant functional groups of DOM included -OH, C=O and N-H. The three fractions contents of lead ( exchangeable, bound to iron and manganese oxides, residual) decreased, while that of lead bound to carbonates varied little. The contents of DOC and lead bound to organic matter appeared positive correlation (r=0.691 8), indicating the effective complexation between DOM and lead ions. The functional groups of -OH, C=O and -COOH played an important role for the speciation transformation of lead, suggested from the FTIR spectra.																	1000-0593					NOV	2015	35	11					3146	3150		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)11-3146-05						WOS:000364503600034		
J	Wang, XC; Chen, H; Lei, K; Sun, Z				Wang, Xuechun; Chen, Hao; Lei, Kun; Sun, Zhong			UVA illumination-induced optical coupling between tryptophan and natural dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Exposure of tryptophan (Trp) in aqueous solutions to UVA radiation resulted in decrease of Trp (C1) but generated an unknown fluorescent component (C2) with fluorescence emission maxima extending into wavelength range characteristic of humic substance (HS)-like material. The intensity of the two components (C1 and C2) could be operationally fit to linear functions of the illumination time t (0 similar to 40 h). However, C1 and C2 decreased and increased nonlinearly respectively in a mixture (Trp mixed with a reference sample of natural organic matter, i.e., NOM) which was exposed to the same UVA illumination, and the change of both C1 and C2 was faster than that in the absence of NOM. Moreover, the UV-Vis absorption maximum (ex = 278 nm) of Trp was faster removed for the mixture (after 5 h) than for Trp solutions without NOM (after 20 h). These observations suggested NOM-facilitated photobleaching of Trp and photoproduction of a new FDOM component under UVA illumination. Meanwhile, the fluorescence of the NOM in the absence of Trp was well represented by two HS-like components which decayed monotonically upon exposure to UVA light, while the photoinduced decay became nonmonotonic in the presence of Trp, and one component even increased with illumination during certain time window, indicating Trp-facilitated production of HS-like fluorescence signatures from NOM. The findings show that UVA-induced optical signature changes of tryptophan and HS-like materials are coupled and highlight the potential impact of absorption of solar UVA light by natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) on using the optical signatures to trace sources and sinks of DOM.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2015	22	21					16969	16977		10.1007/s11356-015-4906-8						WOS:000363964700068	26115705

Shifts in microbial food web structure and productivity after additions of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter: Results from large-scale lacustrine mesocosms	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Predicting the effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on pelagic food webs can be difficult because DOM modifies water column optics and can have contrasting effects on species across trophic levels. We combined large mesocosm, smaller-scale experiments and autoregressive modeling driven bu DOC concentration or DOM optical quality (colored DOM, or CDOM, measured as DOC-specific absorbance at 320 nm, SUVA(320)) to assess how heterotrophic and phototrophic microbial populations were altered in a temperate oligotrophic lake. DOM additions yielded DOC concentrations of 1.6 mg L-1 (control) 2.5 mg L-1, 3.0 mg L-1, and 4.3 mg L-1. Primary (PP) and bacterial (BP) production as well as heterotrophic and autotrophic protist abundances were stimulated in the higher DOM additions. BP responded rapidly to DOM additions, but unlike PP, returned to the level of controls within 2-7 d. A bioassay showed that the DOM was a nitrogen source for phytoplankton. The two models revealed that BP and edible phytoplankton were stimulated by CDOM (SUVA(320)), but only BP was stimulated by DOC concentration. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) inhibited protists in both models, but stimulated edible phytoplankton only in the SUVA(320) model runs. These results suggest that in transparent oligotrophic lakes large influxes of terrestrial (high SUVA(320)) DOM will stimulate the microbial food web by providing a nutrient subsidy to bacteria and reducing exposure of protists to damaging UV. Nutrients associated with moderate DOM input may also stimulate PP relative to BP, as was observed in these and other experiments, rather than causing an overall system shift toward heterotrophy.

This study was aimed to reveal the effects of pH and ionic strength on the ETC of DOM and the possible mechanisms. DOM was prepared into solutions with various pH values (4, 6, 7, 8, and 10) and ionic strength (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 mol/L KCl). ETC of DOM including electron-accepting capacity (EAC) and electron-donating capacity (EDC) was determined with chronoamperometry. Spectroscopic and chromatographic properties of DOM were evaluated to obtain related structural information to explore the possible mechanisms for the ETC changes. Both the EAC and EDC of DOM increased consistently with increasing pH from 4 to 10. EAC and EDC increased with increasing ionic strength, peaked at 0.1 mol/L KCl, and then decreased. Gel permeation chromatogram displayed different molecular size distribution for the DOM in solution with different pH and ionic strength. Environmental pH and ionic strength influence the ETC of DOM by altering the conformation of DOM molecules.				yuan, yong/B-1042-2010													1439-0108	1614-7480				NOV	2015	15	11					2257	2264		10.1007/s11368-015-1154-y						WOS:000363724600007

The adsorption of FA on activated carbon was greatly declined due to competitive adsorption as a result of oxidation coupling of phenolics. However, the physicochemical characteristics of novel activated carbons (surface metal oxides and mesoporosity) can play an important role in alleviating this effect. The adsorption of FA onto F400 fluctuated a lot due to a relatively lower mesoporosity and surface basicity. Kinetic study was also conducted to determine the effects of oxidative coupling on adsorption kinetics of FA. The results demonstrated that presence of phenolics caused more significant effect on FA adsorption kinetics as compared to humic acid (HA).																	0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2015	226	11							377	10.1007/s11270-015-2643-8						WOS:000363250500022

Landscape Control on the Spatial and Temporal Variability of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter and Dissolved Organic Carbon in Large African Rivers	ECOSYSTEMS												The characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as well as the concentrations and stable isotope composition (delta C-13) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were characterized in several large rivers of Africa including the Congo, Niger, Zambezi, and Ogoou, basins. We compared the spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality along with various environmental gradients, including hydrology, river size, catchment vegetation, and connectivity to land. The optical proxies used include the absorption coefficient at 350 nm, the specific ultra-violet absorbance, and the spectral slope ratio (S (R) = 275-295-nm slope divided by 350-400-nm slope). Our results show that land cover plays a primary role in controlling both DOC concentration and optical properties of DOM in tropical freshwaters. A higher cover of dense forest in the catchment leads to a higher quantity of highly aromatic DOM in the river network, whereas an increasing savannah cover results in lower DOC concentrations and less absorptive DOM. In addition to land cover, the watershed morphology (expressed by the average slope) exerts a strong control on DOC and CDOM in tropical rivers. Our results also show that the percentage of C3 and C4 vegetation cover is not an accurate predictor for DOM and CDOM quality in rivers due to the importance of the spatial distribution of land cover within the drainage network. The comparison of our results with previously published CDOM data in temperate and high-latitude rivers highlights that DOM in tropical freshwaters is generally more aromatic, and shows a higher capacity for absorbing sunlight irradiance.

Dean			Direct and indirect effects of additions of chromophoric dissolved organic matter on zooplankton during large-scale mesocosm experiments in an oligotrophic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The effects of changes in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on zooplankton grazers in pelagic food webs can be difficult to predict due to the potential for conflicting direct and indirect effects of CDOM on water column optics and food-web dynamics. We compared the responses of two dominant zooplankton groups, Daphnia spp. and calanoid copepods, to elevated CDOM in two mesocosm experiments conducted in a transparent, oligotrophic lake. 2. In the first experiment, low, medium and high additions of CDOM [dissolved organic carbon (DOC)=2.7, 3.0 and 4.3mgL(-1), respectively] and non-manipulated controls (DOC=1.6mgL(-1)) were used to test the hypothesis that food-web stimulation will increase with CDOM concentration. In the second experiment, we manipulated both CDOM (control and addition) and ultraviolet radiation (UV; ambient and shielded) to determine the importance of CDOM as a UV screen, as well as to examine the role of UV in food-web stimulation by CDOM. We also conducted short-term bioassays alongside this second experiment to assess the food resources for Daphnia and calanoids in treatments with UV-exposed and non-UV-exposed CDOM. 3. Daphnia abundance increased in the low and medium CDOM additions in the first experiment, and when food resources were simultaneously stimulated by CDOM and protected from the direct negative effects of UV in the second experiment. 4. In contrast, calanoid copepod abundance declined or remained unchanged when CDOM was added, and this response was not mediated by food resources. 5. Overall, our findings suggest that increased CDOM in clear lakes could alter the relative abundance of zooplankton groups through a combination of direct and indirect effects.

Effects of plant-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) on soil CO2 and N2O emissions and soil carbon and nitrogen sequestrations	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils play an essential role in soil physical, chemical and biological processes, but little information is available on the biodegradability of plant-derived DOM and its effect on soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration in field soils. The objectives of this study were to investigate the impacts of crop residue-derived DOM on soil CO2 and N2O emissions, as well as soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration by adding water extracts of maize stalk (i.e., plant-derived DOM) to soils. In this study, wheat was grown in pots under field conditions with treated soils, the soils treatments were: plant-derived DOM (PDOM), urea nitrogen (N), PDOM + urea nitrogen (PDOM + N), as well as a control with no additions to soil (CK). Adding plant-derived DOM to soil increased soil CO2 and N2O emissions (P < 0.05). During the wheat growing season, the cumulative CO2-C emission from CK, PDOM, N and PDOM + N was 107 +/- 1, 157 +/- 7, 136 +/- 2 and 149 +/- 6 g Cm-2, respectively. Meanwhile, the cumulative N2O-N emission from CK, PDOM, N and PDOM + N was 188 +/- 8, 256 +/- 5, 239 +/- 10 and 258 +/- 7 mg N m(-2), respectively. Compared with N treatment, DOM addition had little effect on soil N sequestration, but it accelerated the decomposition of native soil organic carbon (SOC) and caused a net loss of SOC. The soil C sequestration decreased about 151 +/- 67 and 51 +/- 45 g C m(-2) in PDOM and PDOM + N treatments, respectively. The increased microbial biomass and root biomass were responsible for the greater CO2 emission in DOM-amended soils. Negative correlation between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and N2O flux suggested that the release of N2O was dependent on the supply of DOC. These results indicated that the supply of plant-derived DOM exacerbated soil CO2 and N2O emissions and reduced soil C sequestration. Therefore, agricultural management practices that increase the stability of highly soluble C inputs and/or retard the decomposition of crop residues should be adopted to decrease soil greenhouse gas emission and increase soil C sequestration.

J	Ward, CP; Cory, RM				Ward, Collin P.; Cory, Rose M.			Chemical composition of dissolved organic matter draining permafrost soils	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Northern circumpolar permafrost soils contain roughly twice the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere today, but the majority of this soil organic carbon is perennially frozen. Climate warming in the arctic is thawing permafrost soils and mobilizing previously frozen dissolved organic matter (DOM) from deeper soil layers to nearby surface waters. Previous studies have reported that ancient DOM draining deeper layers of permafrost soils was more susceptible to degradation by aquatic bacteria compared to modern DOM draining the shallow active layer of permafrost soils, and have suggested that DOM chemical composition may be an important control for the lability of DOM to bacterial degradation. However, the compositional features that distinguish DOM drained from different depths in permafrost soils are poorly characterized. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the chemical composition of DOM drained from different depths in permafrost soils, and relate these compositional differences to its susceptibility to biological degradation. DOM was leached from the shallow organic mat and the deeper permafrost layer of soils within the Imnavait Creek watershed on the North Slope of Alaska. DOM draining both soil layers was characterized in triplicate by coupling ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry, C-13 solid-state NMR, and optical spectroscopy methods with multi-variate statistical analyses. Reproducibility of replicate mass spectra was high, and compositional differences resulting from interfering species or isolation effects were significantly smaller than differences between DOM drained from each soil layer. All analyses indicated that DOM leached from the shallower organic mat contained higher molecular weight, more oxidized, and more unsaturated aromatic species compared to DOM leached from the deeper permafrost layer. Bacterial production rates and bacterial efficiencies were significantly higher for permafrost compared to organic mat DOM; however, respiration rates were similar between DOM sources. Increased release of permafrost DOM from arctic soils to surface waters will change the chemical composition of DOM and its lability to bacteria, but this study suggests that these shifts in DOM composition and lability may not increase the carbon dioxide produced by bacterial respiration of permafrost DOM exported to arctic surface waters compared to DOM currently draining the shallow active layer.

Efficient removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen (TN) after the bio-treatment were 91.3%, 87.3% and 69.1%, respectively. UV270 was proven to be a stable UV absorption peak of CWW that could reflect the mixture of phenols, heterocyclics, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives. Molecular weight and aromaticity were increased, and also the content of polar functional groups was greatly reduced after bio-treatment. Three fluorescent components were identified by PARAFAC: C1 (tyrosine-like), C2 (tryptophan-like) and C3 (humic-like). The removal rate of protein-like was higher than that of humic-like and C1 was identified as biodegradable substance. Correlation analysis showed UV270 had an excellent correlation with COD (r = 0.921, n = 60, P<0.01) and DOC (r = 0.959, n = 60, P<0.01) and significant correlation (r = 0.875, n = 60, P<0.01) was also found between C2 and TN. Therefore, spectroscopic characterization could provide novel insights into removal behaviors of DOM and potential to monitor water quality real-time during CWW bio-treatment.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2015	72	8					1411	1420		10.2166/wst.2015.333						WOS:000374288300020	26465313

Kent			Hydrologic control of dissolved organic matter concentration and quality in a semiarid artificially drained agricultural catchment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Agricultural practices have altered watershed-scale dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics, including in-stream concentration, biodegradability, and total catchment export. However, mechanisms responsible for these changes are not clear, and field-scale processes are rarely directly linked to the magnitude and quality of DOM that is transported to surface water. In a small (12 ha) agricultural catchment in eastern Washington State, we tested the hypothesis that hydrologic connectivity in a catchment is the dominant control over the concentration and quality of DOM exported to surface water via artificial subsurface drainage. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and humic-like components of DOM decreased while the Fluorescence Index and Freshness Index increased with depth through the soil profile. In drain discharge, these characteristics were significantly correlated with drain flow across seasons and years, with drain DOM resembling deep sources during low-flow and shallow sources during high flow, suggesting that DOM from shallow sources bypasses removal processes when hydrologic connectivity in the catchment is greatest. Assuming changes in streamflow projected for the Palouse River (which contains the study catchment) under the A1B climate scenario (rapid growth, dependence on fossil fuel, and renewable energy sources) apply to the study catchment, we project greater interannual variability in annual DOC export in the future, with significant increases in the driest years. This study highlights the variability in DOM inputs from agricultural soil to surface water on daily to interannual time scales, pointing to the need for a more nuanced understanding of agricultural impacts on DOM dynamics in surface water.																	0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2015	51	10					8146	8164		10.1002/2015WR016884						WOS:000368418400018

Metatranscriptomic reads were classified taxonomically (by genomic binning) and functionally (using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), and the relative gene expression of individual taxa (genome bins) was compared with the total community response. In the first experiment comparing seawater and seawater amended with diatom-derived DOM, metatranscriptomes revealed pronounced differences in pathways involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In the second experiment comparing seawater amended with cyanobacteria- and diatom-derived DOM, metatranscriptomes had similar functional profiles, likely reflecting more similar DOM regimes in this experimental setup. Among the five most abundant taxa investigated in more detail, two featured pronounced differences in transcript abundance between treatments suggesting that they were specialized in the use of only one of the two DOM regimes. However, these two taxa were less involved in carbohydrate metabolism than others and had few genes that were significantly regulated in response to the DOM source. Our results indicate that both substrate composition and the competitive interplay of community members were decisive for the functional response of a microbial system.

J	Chen, M; Lee, JH; Hur, J				Chen, Meilian; Lee, Jong-Hyeon; Hur, Jin			Effects of sampling methods on the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter in sediment pore waters as revealed by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Despite literature evidence suggesting the importance of sampling methods on the properties of sediment pore waters, their effects on the dissolved organic matter (PW-DOM) have been unexplored to date. Here, we compared the effects of two commonly used sampling methods (i.e., centrifuge and Rhizon sampler) on the characteristics of PW-DOM for the first time. The bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption, and excitation-emission matrixes coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) of the PW-DOM samples were compared for the two sampling methods with the sediments from minimal to severely contaminated sites. The centrifuged samples were found to have higher average values of DOC, UV absorption, and protein-like EEM-PARAFAC components. The samples collected with the Rhizon sampler, however, exhibited generally more humified characteristics than the centrifuged ones, implying a preferential collection of PW-DOM with respect to the sampling methods. Furthermore, the differences between the two sampling methods seem more pronounced in relatively more polluted sites. Our observations were possibly explained by either the filtration effect resulting from the smaller pore size of the Rhizon sampler or the desorption of DOM molecules loosely bound to minerals during centrifugation, or both. Our study suggests that consistent use of one sampling method is crucial for PW-DOM studies and also that caution should be taken in the comparison of data collected with different sampling methods.

However, the existing methods mainly focus on the qualitative description for the humification degree of compost. In this paper, projection pursuit classification (PPC) was conducted to quantitative assess the grades of compost maturity, based on the characteristics of fluorescence spectra of DOM. Eight organic wastes (chicken manure, swine manure, kitchen waste, lawn waste, fruits and vegetables waste, straw, green waste, and municipal solid waste) composting were conducted, the germination percentage (GI) and fluorescence spectra of DOM were measured during composting. Statistic analysis with all fluorescence parameters of DOM indicated that I-436/I-383 (a ratio between the fluorescence intensities at 436 and 383 nm in excitation spectra), FLR (an area ratio between fulvic-like region from 308 to 363 nm and total region in emission spectra), P-HA/pro (a regional integration ratio between humic acid-like region to protein-like region in excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra), A(4)/A(1) (an area ratio of the last quarter to the first quarter in emission spectra), r((A,C)) (a ratio between the fluorescence intensities of peak A and peak C in EEM spectra) were correlated with each other (p<0.01), suggesting that this fluorescence parameters could be considered as comprehensive evaluation index system of PPC. Subsequently, the four degrades of compost maturity included the best degree of maturity (I, GI>80%) better degree of compost maturity (II, 60%<GI<80%), maturity (III, 50%<GI<60%), and immaturity (IV, GI<50%) were divided according the GI value during composting. The corresponding fluorescence parameter values were calculated at each degrade of compost maturity. Then the projection values were calculated based on PPC considering the above fluorescence parameter values. The projection value was 2.01 similar to 2.22 for I grade, 1.21 similar to 2.0 for II grade, 0.57 similar to 1.2 for III grade, and 0.10 similar to 0.56 for Er grade. Model validation was then carried out with composts samples, the results indicated that the simulated values were agreed with the observed values, and the accuracy of PPC was 75% for four grades of maturity, and 100% for maturity and immaturity, suggesting that PPC could meet the need of the assessment of compost maturity.																	1000-0593					OCT	2015	35	10					2940	2945		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)10-2940-06						WOS:000362241400050

DOM samples were isolated from two streams draining watersheds of different land uses, landfill leachates of two ages, sequential (raw, facility- and wetland-treated) wastewaters in a wastewater treatment plant. Two sampling sites along the Missouri River were located upstream and downstream of the outlet of a tributary, to which the stream waters, landfill leachates, and wastewater effluents were discharged. Compared with the chemical composition of the stream DOM from a cropland-dominated watershed, the stream DOM from a grass/forestland-dominated watershed comprised 14 % more alkyl carbons (C), but similar to 5 % less O-alkyl C. The two leachate DOM samples from landfill cells of two ages showed similar area fractions of the carbon types, and their spectra exhibited a characteristic alkyl C peak at 37 ppm, potentially a molecular signature of the DOM of landfill leachate source. The DOM from the treated wastewater had slightly (similar to 4 %) less alkyl C than that from the raw wastewater, and the DOM from the wetland-treated wastewater displayed decreased O-alkyl C but increased alkyl C, both to a small degree (by similar to 4 %), compared to the DOM in the facility-treated wastewater. The chemical composition of DOM in the Missouri River was affected by the local organic inputs, with the DOM from downstream the outlet displaying similar to 11 % higher alkyl C.

This study examined similarities in the nature of DOM and investigated the link between groundwater DOM (GDOM) and sedimentary organic matter (SOM) from a lacustrine-alluvial aquifer at Jianghan Plain. Sediment, groundwater and surface water samples were employed for SOM extraction, optical and/or chemical characterization, and subsequent fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and parallel factor analyses (PARAFAC). Spectroscopic properties of bulk DOM pools showed that indices indicative of GDOM (e.g., biological source properties, humification level, aromaticity and molecule mobility) varied within the ranges of those of two extracted end-members of SOM: humic-like materials and microbe-associated materials. The coexistence of PARAFAC compositions and the sustaining internal relationship between GDOM and extracted SOM indicate a similar source. The results from principal component analyses with selected spectroscopic indices showed that GDOM exhibited a transition trend regarding its nature: from refractory high-humification DOM to intermediate humification DOM and then to microbe-associated DOM, with decreasing molecular weight. Correlations of spectroscopic indices with physicochemical parameters of the groundwater suggested that GDOM was released from SOM and was modified by microbial diagenetic processes. The current study demonstrated the associations of GDOM with SOM from a spectroscopic viewpoint and provided new evidence supporting SOM as the source of GDOM. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Targeted Removal of Dissolved Organic Matter in Boiler-Blowdown Wastewater: Integrated Membrane Filtration for Produced Water Reuse	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												The efficacy of coagulation and membrane filtration was studied for the treatment of boiler-blowdown (BBD) wastewater to enable reuse and minimize the overall water consumption in steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD), thermally enhanced, oil recovery operations. Direct nanofiltration of chemically unadjusted BBD at its original pH was the optimal treatment option with respect to the flux stability and the removal of dissolved organic material and salinity, which if not removed would result in the fouling and failure of downstream process equipment. The naturally high solute hydrophilicity allowed for prolonged operation with an elevated flux of 60 L m(-2) h(-1) (LMH) and recovery up to 85% while maintaining solute removal as high as 80% and 45% for dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved solids, respectively. Comparatively, neither precoagulation nor preacidification improved the rejection of dissolved organic material or salinity and consistently resulted in increased membrane surface fouling and flux decline. The proposed filtration treatment solution would result inasmuch as a 4-fold reduction in the volume of makeup water required and BBD wastewater disposed compared to a conventional SAGD facility.																	0888-5885					SEP 30	2015	54	38					9431	9439		10.1021/acs.iecr.5b02035						WOS:000362243400017

The two steps mixing model of the a(CDOM)(lambda) with salinity have been derived based on 3521 CDOM absorption observations done in Baltic Sea, from 1993 until April 2014 and 1011 CDOM absorption observation done in the Danish Straits from August 2006 until February 2008. Disproportionate decrease and even increase of CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm, a(CDOM)(350), with increased salinity was observed in deep waters. There was a significant increase of the a(CDOM)(350) mixing model residual values in deep water compared to overlaying waters. The a(CDOM)(350) mixing model residual values tended to increase significantly with increasing salinity in deep waters. The CDOM and FDOM composition has been assessed by spectral slope coefficient, S300-600, the Humification Index (HIX), calculated from measured DOM fluorescence Excitation Emission Matrix spectra and from ratio of the humic-like and protein-like DOM fluorescence measured in situ. The S300-600 values decreased significantly in deep waters compared with overlaying waters. There was a strong (R-2 = 0.705) inverse linear relationship between S300-600 and a(CDOM)(350) mixing model residuals. The HIX, and the values of the ratio of the humic-like to protein-like DOM fluorescence increased significantly in the deep waters, what indicated increase of humic-like and decrease of protein-like DOM fraction in the deep waters samples compared to control surface waters samples. An exponential relationship between the humic-like to protein-like FDOM intensity ratio and the apparent oxygen utilization - AOU was observed in the Gulf of Gdansk. Presented results suggested that possible DOM emission from sediments into the adjacent near bottom water in anoxic conditions, could explain the a(CDOM)(lambda) mixing anomaly. Microbial DOM reprocessing in anoxic condition, documented by direct in situ measurements, significantly changed the CDOM and FDOM composition. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Moshiur; Ahmed, Kazi Matin			Dissolved Organic Matter Quality in a Shallow Aquifer of Bangladesh: Implications for Arsenic Mobility	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In some high arsenic (As) groundwater systems, correlations are observed between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and As concentrations, but in other systems, such relationships are absent. The role of labile DOM as the main driver of microbial reductive dissolution is not sufficient to explain the variation in DOM-As relationships. Other processes that may also influence As mobility include complexation of As by dissolved humic substances, and competitive sorption and electron shuttling reactions mediated by humics. To evaluate such humic DOM influences, we characterized the optical properties of filtered surface water (n = 10) and groundwater (n = 24) samples spanning an age gradient in Araihazar, Bangladesh. Further, we analyzed large volume fulvic acid (FA) isolates (n = 6) for optical properties, C and N content, and C-13 NMR spectroscopic distribution. Old groundwater (>30 years old) contained primarily sediment-derived DOM and had significantly higher (p < 0.001) dissolved As concentration than groundwater that was younger than 5 years old. Younger groundwater had DOM spectroscopic signatures similar to surface water DOM and characteristic of a sewage pollution influence. Associations between dissolved As, iron (Fe), and FA concentration and fluorescence properties of isolated FA in this field study suggest that aromatic, terrestrially derived FAs promote As-Fe-FA complexation reactions that may enhance As mobility.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 15	2015	49	18					10815	10824		10.1021/acs.est.5b01962						WOS:000361415800008	26192081

In this study, an Escherichia coli whole-cell bioreporter construct with antibiotic resistance genes coupled to green fluorescence protein was exposed to tetracycline in the presence of DOM derived from humic acids. Complexation between tetracycline and DOM diminished tetracycline bioavailability to E. coli, as indicated by reduced expression of antibiotic resistance genes. Increasing DOM concentration resulted in decreasing bioavailability of tetracycline to the bioreporter. Freely dissolved tetracycline (not complexed with DOM) was identified as the major fraction responsible for the rate and magnitude of antibiotic resistance genes expressed. Furthermore, adsorption of DOM on bacterial cell surfaces inhibited tetracycline diffusion into the bioreporter cells. The magnitude of the inhibition was related to the amount of DOM adsorbed and tetracycline affinity for the DOM. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which the bioavailability of tetracycline antibiotics to bacteria is reduced by DOM present in water. Agricultural lands receiving livestock manures commonly have elevated levels of both DOM and antibiotics; the DOM could suppress the bioavailability of antibiotics, hence reducing selective pressure on bacteria for development of antibiotic resistance.

Metal-DOM interactions were quantified using linear and log-transformed DOM absorbance spectra acquired at varying pHs and total Ca2+ and Cu2+ concentrations. The binding of Cu2+ by DOM was examined in the presence of three different Ca2+ concentrations. Interactions of Ca2+ with DOM chromophores were accompanied by the emergence of features in the differential spectra that were dissimilar from those characteristic for the binding of Cu2+. The amount of Ca2+ and Cu2+ bound by DOM was ascertained using changes of the slopes of log-transformed absorbance spectra in the range of wavelength 350-400 nm (denoted as S350-400) and comparing the data with model predictions. The observed effects indicated the occurrence of the replacement of a characteristic number of protons by the bound Ca2+ and Cu2+ ions.

Seasonal Variation of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, Using Combined Landsat and Field Data	REMOTE SENSING												Coastal bays, such as Barataria Bay, are important transition zones between the terrigenous and marine environments that are also optically complex due to elevated amounts of particulate and dissolved constituents. Monthly field data collected over a period of 15 months in 2010 and 2011 in Barataria Bay were used to develop an empirical band ratio algorithm for the Landsat-5 TM that showed a good correlation with the Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a(g)355) (R-2 = 0.74). Landsat-derived CDOM maps generally captured the major details of CDOM distribution and seasonal influences, suggesting the potential use of Landsat imagery to monitor biogeochemistry in coastal water environments. An investigation of the seasonal variation in a(g)355 conducted using Landsat-derived a(g)355 as well as field data suggested the strong influence of seasonality in the different regions of the bay with the marine end members (lower bay) experiencing generally low but highly variable a(g)355 and the freshwater end members (upper bay) experiencing high a(g)355 with low variability. Barataria Bay experienced a significant increase in a(g)355 during the freshwater release at the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion (DPFD) following the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in 2010 and following the Mississippi River (MR) flood conditions in 2011, resulting in a weak linkage to salinity in comparison to the other seasons. Tree based statistical analysis showed the influence of high river flow conditions, high- and low-pressure systems that appeared to control a(g)355 by 28%, 29% and 43% of the time duration over the study period at the marine end member just outside the bay. An analysis of CDOM variability in 2010 revealed the strong influence of the MR in controlling CDOM abundance in the lower bay during the high flow conditions, while strong winds associated with cold fronts significantly increase CDOM abundance in the upper bay, thus revealing the important role these events play in the CDOM dynamics of the bay.																	2072-4292					SEP	2015	7	9					12478	12502		10.3390/rs70912478						WOS:000362511400070		
J	Bao, HY; Wu, Y; Zhang, J				Bao, Hongyan; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Jing			Spatial and temporal variation of dissolved organic matter in the Changjiang: Fluvial transport and flux estimation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Changjiang is the most important source of freshwater and dissolved organic matter (DOM) for the East China Sea. However, knowledge regarding the sources, seasonal fluxes, and fluvial transport of terrigenous DOM (tDOM) in the Changjiang is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved lignin in water samples collected in the middle and lower Changjiang under different hydrological conditions. Additional samples were collected biweekly in the lower Changjiang. Through comparisons with other rivers, we found that the DOC in the Changjiang is mainly from soil organic matter and has a higher fraction of tDOM during flood. Mass balance model results indicate that approximately 33% of the dissolved lignin discharged into the middle and lower Changjiang is removed during its transport to the lower reach during both low-discharge and flood periods. Based on a comparison of the removal rates under these two contrasting hydrological conditions and considering the lower organic carbon content and fine grain size of the Changjiang's suspended particles, we speculate that the major process for the removal of dissolved lignin is sorption, and potentially flocculation by suspended particles. Changjiang discharges 1.40.10Tgyr(-1) and 8.60.30Ggyr(-1) DOC and dissolved lignin to the estuary during the period of July 2010 to June 2011, respectively. Seasonal distributions of DOC and dissolved lignin fluxes are controlled by water discharge, which will be affected by future climate change and the Three Gorges Dam.																	2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP	2015	120	9					1870	1886		10.1002/2015JG002948						WOS:000363332900012

Both the protein-like and the humic-like components showed a marked quenching effect by Cu (II). Negligible quenching effects were found for Cd (II) by components 1, 5 and 6. The stability constants and the fraction of the binding fluorophores for humic-like components and Cu (II) can be influenced by macrophyte decomposition of various weight gradients in aquatic plants. Macrophyte decomposition within the scope of the appropriate aquatic phytomass can maximize the stability constant of DOM-metal complexes. A large amount of organic matter was introduced into the aquatic environment by macrophyte decomposition, suggesting that the potential risk of DOM as a carrier of heavy metal contamination in macrophytic lakes should not be ignored.

J	Peng, T; Lu, XL; Su, RG; Zhang, DM				Peng Tong; Lu Xiao-lan; Su Rong-guo; Zhang Dong-mei			Absorption and Fluorescence Properties of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter Produced by Algae	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Four kinds of diatom (Chaetoceros curvisetus, Phaeodactylumtricornutum, Nitzschia closterium f. minutissima and Navicula halophile) and two kinds of dinoflagellates (Prorocentrum donghaiense and Gymnodinium) were cultured under laboratory conditions. Variations of optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were studied with absorption and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy(EEM) during growth of marine microalgae in incubation experiment. Absorption spectrum revealed absorption coefficient a(355) (CDOM absorption coefficients at 355 nm) of 6 kinds of marine microalgae above increased by 64.8%, 242.3%, 535.1%, 903.2%, 836% and 196.4%, respectively. Simultaneously, the absorption spectral slope(Sg), determined between 270 and 350 rim, representing the size of molecular weight of CDOM and humic-like composition, decreased by 8.7%, 34.6%, 39.4%, 53.1%, 46.7%, and 35.7%, respectively. Applying parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) together with EEM got four components of CDOM: C1(Ex/Em=350(260) nm/450 nm), C2 (Ex/Em=260 (430) nm/525 nm) 03 (Ex/Em=325 nm/400 nm) and C4(Ex/Em=275 nm/325 nm), which.were relative to three humic-like and one protein-like fluorescent components of Nitzschia closterium f. minutissima and Navicula halophile. In incubation experiment, fluorescence intensity of these four components during growth of Nitzschia closterium f. minutissima increased by, respectively, 8.68, 24.9, 7.19 and 39.8 times, and those of Navicula halophile increased by 2.64, 0.07, 4.39 and 12.4 times, respectively. Significant relationships were found between the fluorescence intensity of four components of CDOM, a(355) and Sg. All results demonstrated that both content and molecular weight of CDOM produced by diatom and dinoflagellate studied in incubation experiment increased, but these two parameters changed more obviously of the diatom than those of dinoflagellate; the proportion of humic-like components in the composition of CDOM also increased clearly with the growth of marine microalgae, but protein-like fluorescent component had only a slow growth. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of CDOM produced by different species of algae changed obviously and the relative composition fluorescence intensity of CDOM produced by different microalgae were found to vary among different composition from EEM, which suggested CDOM produced by different microalgae make quite different contributions to CDOM in natural seawater.																	1000-0593					SEP	2015	35	9					2424	2430		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)09-2424-07						WOS:000361268300009

The effects of these blooms on marine ecosystem functioning and particularly on the dynamics of the heterotrophic bacteria are still unclear. The response of the bacterial community from a Mediterranean coastal lagoon to the addition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the jellyfish Aurelia aurita, corresponding to an enrichment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 1.4, was assessed for 22 days in microcosms (8 l). The high bioavailability of this material led to (i) a rapid mineralization of the DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen from the jellyfish and (ii) the accumulation of high concentrations of ammonium and orthophosphate in the water column. DOM from jellyfish greatly stimulated heterotrophic prokaryotic production and respiration rates during the first 2 days; then, these activities showed a continuous decay until reaching those measured in the control microcosms (lagoon water only) at the end of the experiment. Bacterial growth efficiency remained below 20 %, indicating that most of the DOM was respired and a minor part was channeled to biomass production. Changes in bacterial diversity were assessed by tag pyrosequencing of partial bacterial 16S rRNA genes, DNA fingerprints, and a cultivation approach. While bacterial diversity in control microcosms showed little changes during the experiment, the addition of DOM from the jellyfish induced a rapid growth of Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio species that were isolated. After 9 days, the bacterial community was dominated by Bacteroidetes, which appeared more adapted to metabolize high-molecular-weight DOM. At the end of the experiment, the bacterial community shifted toward a higher proportion of Alphaproteobacteria. Resilience of the bacterial community after the addition of DOM from the jellyfish was higher for metabolic functions than diversity, suggesting that jellyfish blooms can induce durable changes in the bacterial community structure in coastal lagoons.

J	Bida, MR; Tyler, AC; Pagano, T				Bida, Morgan R.; Tyler, Anna Christina; Pagano, Todd			Quantity and composition of stream dissolved organic matter in the watershed of Conesus Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of soluble organic compounds that plays important roles in stream ecosystem function. We examined temporal and spatial variation in stream DOM characteristics in the small watersheds draining into Conesus Lake, New York, USA. While all watersheds were impacted by human activity, our study sites spanned multiple land uses, with distinct differences in the proportion of agriculture and natural land cover. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic and organic nitrogen and phosphorus were measured seasonally, with a more detailed analysis during the growing season. DOM composition was assessed with a suite of optical indices and multidimensional fluorescence with parallel factor analysis. Seasonal shifts in the composition and quantity of DOM, characterized by increased protein-like fluorescence in the growing season and maximum DOC concentrations in the fall, were consistent with abiotic seasonal controls and the seasonal influx of allochthonous organic matter to all streams. However, agriculturally dominated streams had higher inorganic nutrients, along with less-humifled, less-molecularly complex, and more protein-like fluorescent DOM than those with less agriculture, suggesting that nutrients may be stimulating greater in-stream DOM production. Stream order also played a strong role, with more similarity in the DOM pools in second order streams, consistent with high in-stream processing of both allochthonous and autochthonous DOM. We conclude that agriculture is an important driver of stream water nutrients and the quantity and composition of DOM, in conjunction with abiotic seasonal drivers and in-stream processing time.

Ammonium and glucose amendments stimulate dissolved organic matter mineralization in a Lake Superior tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an integral role in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems, and rates of DOM mineralization can be affected by nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) availability in the water column. To determine if DOM mineralization rates were limited by availability of N or C in a small tributary of Lake Superior, we conducted 28-day laboratory experiments where we amended stream water with a microbial inoculum and ammonium (NH4+) and/or glucose in a full factorial design. We repeated these experiments on four dates (July, October, January, April) because we expected nutrient limitation to vary with temporal changes in sources of DOM and nutrients. DOM mineralization rates were stimulated by additions of NH4+ in three of the four experiments and by glucose in all four experiments, even in October when carbon inputs to the stream via leaf litter were greatest. Mean biodegradable dissolved organic C was greater in July (40.6% +/- 5.4) than October (10.2% +/- 0.9) or January (9.6% +/- 10.9) but did not differ from April (18.4% +/- 0.7), which suggests the composition of DOM varies temporally. Our results suggest that biodegradable DOM is exported from this forested stream to nearshore Lake Superior throughout the year, but DOM mineralization can be stimulated by additions of both carbon and nitrogen. Nutrient enrichment may alter in-stream processing of DOM in small forested tributary streams, in turn reducing export of biodegradable DOM to nearshore regions of the Great Lakes where it fuels microbial production.

J	Li, YP; Wang, SR; Zhang, L				Li, Yanping; Wang, Shengrui; Zhang, Li			Composition, source characteristic and indication of eutrophication of dissolved organic matter in the sediments of Erhai Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Composition and source characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the surface sediments of Erhai Lake were studied by using fluorescence spectroscopy and UV-Vis absorbance. Moreover, the influence factors and the indication significance for eutrophication are also discussed. The results are as follows: (1) The DOC content of Erhai Lake sediments ranges from 0.17 to 0.77 g kg(-1), which is higher in dry season than that in wet season. Its DOC content of the sediment from the northern part is higher than that from the southern, and that is the smallest in the central. Moreover, DOM in Erhai Lake sediments comprise of protein- and humic-like substances. The average contents of protein-, fulvic acid-like substances and soluble microbial byproduct-like materials in the wet season are higher than those in the dry season by 25.92, 11.82 and 2.96 %, respectively; while the content of humic-like substance in the wet season is lower than that in the dry season by 6.94 %. As to the spatial distribution, the contents of protein- and fulvic acid-like substances are the highest in the central of Erhai Lake sediments, and that of the humic-like substance is the highest in the southern part. In addition, the humification degree of DOM in the dry season is higher than that in the wet season. (2) The DOM in Erhai Lake sediments mainly originated from terrestrial sources, of which the terrestrial pollutant has a main impact in the dry season, and the terrestrial pollutant input and biogenetic derivation play an equally important part in the wet season. Terrestrial pollutant and aquatic plants are the important factors that influence the DOM composition of Erhai Lake sediments. (3) The characteristic parameter (P-(III+V,P-n)/P-(I+II,P-n)) (the content ratio of humic-like substance to protein-like substances) of the DOM composition of Erhai Lake sediments is positively correlated with the contents of the different nitrogen (N) forms in the sediments (R (2) = 0.68-0.83, P < 0.01). The contents of N forms in sediments and its source characteristic can be reflected by the P-(III+V,P-n)/P-(I+II,P-n) value. So the P-(III+V,P-n)/P-(I+II,P-n) value can be taken as the indirect indicator of the contents of N forms in sediments. Moreover, the composition characteristic of DOM in sediments can reflect the contents of N forms to some extent, that is, the risk of N release from Erhai Lake sediments can be indicated to some extent.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2015	74	5					3739	3751		10.1007/s12665-014-3964-4						WOS:000360401400007		
J	Zhou, YQ; Zhang, YL; Shi, K; Liu, XH; Niu, C				Zhou, Yongqiang; Zhang, Yunlin; Shi, Kun; Liu, Xiaohan; Niu, Cheng			Dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter influenced by hydrological conditions in a large, shallow, and eutrophic lake in China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												High concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are terrestrially derived from upstream tributaries to Lake Taihu, China, and are influenced by hydrological conditions of the upstream watershed. To investigate how the dynamics of CDOM in Lake Taihu are influenced by upstream inflow runoff, four sampling cruises, differing in hydrological conditions, were undertaken in the lake and its three major tributaries, rivers Yincun, Dapu, and Changdou. CDOM absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and stable isotope delta C-13 and delta N-15 measurements were conducted to characterize the dynamics of CDOM. The mean absorption coefficient a(350) collected from the three river profiles (5.15 +/- 1.92 m(-1)) was significantly higher than that of the lake (2.95 +/- 1.88 m(-1)), indicating that the upstream rivers carried a substantial load of CDOM to the lake. This finding was substantiated by the exclusively terrestrial signal exhibited by the level of delta C-13 (-26.23 +/- 0.49aEuro degrees) of CDOM samples collected from the rivers. Mean a(350) and COD in Lake Taihu were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season (t test, p < 0.0001), suggesting that the abundance of CDOM in the lake is strongly influenced by hydrological conditions of the watershed. Four components were identified by parallel factor analysis, including two protein-like components (C1 and C2), a terrestrial humic-like component (C3), and a microbial humic-like (C4) component. The contribution percentage of the two humic-like components relative to the summed fluorescence intensity of the four components (C (humic)) increased significantly from the dry to the wet season. This seasonal difference in contribution further substantiated that an enhanced rainfall followed by an elevated inflow runoff in the lake watershed in the wet season may result in an increase in humic-like substances being discharged into the lake compared to that in the dry season. This finding was further supported by an elevated a(250)/a(365) of CDOM samples collected in the lake in the wet season than in the dry season. Significantly higher mean levels of C3 and a(350) were recorded for CDOM samples collected from River Yincun than those from rivers Dapu and Changdou, differing in seasons, suggesting the significance of terrestrial CDOM input from River Yincun.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2015	22	17					12992	13003		10.1007/s11356-015-4556-x						WOS:000360311500021	25916473

To evaluate the effect of biogas residue content of initial composting mixture on the composting efficiency, co-composting processes of biogas residues and livestock manure (BRLM) were performed in terms of weight fractions of biogas residues (T1: 30%, T2: 40%, T3: 50% and T4: 60%). The dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation was characterised. Fractionation of DOM, FTIR, UV-vis and fluorescence spectra indicated that the degradation efficiency of alcohols, ether and polysaccharides, and molecular weight, aromaticity and polycondensation degree of composts were in the order T3 > T2 > T1 > T4. Parallel factor analysis also showed that the content of humic-like substances was in the same order. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that humified and stabilised degree of compost was optimal when the weight fraction of biogas residues was 40-50%. Bacterial profiles implied that biogas residue content of composting substrate significantly influenced bacterial dynamics. Bacteria were mainly active in the degradation of easily biodegradable organic matter and lignin. The abundance of bacteria involved in the degradation of easily biodegradable organic matter and lignin in the course of composting was closely related to composting efficiency and humification degree of compost.

Tracking litter-derived dissolved organic matter along a soil chronosequence using C-14 imaging: Biodegradation, physico-chemical retention or preferential flow?	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												The cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is controversial. While DOM is believed to be a C source for soil microorganisms, DOM sorption to the mineral phase is regarded as a key stabilization mechanism of soil organic matter (SOM). In this study, we added C-14-labelled DOM derived from Leucanthemopsis alpina to undisturbed soil columns of a chronosequence ranging from initial unweathered soils of a glacier forefield to alpine soils with thick organic. layers. We traced the C-14 label in mineralized and leached DOM and quantified the spatial distribution of (DOC)-C-14 retained in soils using a new autoradiographic technique. Leaching of (DOC)-C-14 through the 10 cm-long soil columns amounted up to 28% of the added (DOC)-C-14 in the initial soils, but to less than 5% in the developed soils. Biodegradation hardly contributed to the removal of litter-(DOC)-C-14 as only 2-9% were mineralized, with the highest rates in mature soils. In line with the mass balance of C-14 fluxes, measured C-14.activities in soils indicated that the major part of litter (DOC)-C-14 was retained in soils (>80% on average). Autoradiographic images showed an effective retention of almost all (DOC)-C-14 in the upper 3 cm of the soil columns. In the deeper soil, the C-14 label was concentrated along soil pores and textural discontinuities with similarly high C-14 activities than in the uppermost soil. These findings indicate DOM transport via preferential flow, although this was quantitatively less important than DOM retention in soils. The leaching of (DOC)-C-14 correlated negatively with oxalate-extractable Al, Fe, and Mn. In conjunction with the rapidity of (DOC)-C-14 immobilization, this strongly suggests that sorptive retention DOM was the dominating pathway of litter-derived DOM in topsoils, thereby contributing to SOM stabilization.

A better understanding of the evolution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its degradation drivers during sludge bio-drying could facilitate its control. Aeration is one of the key factors that affect sludge bio-drying performance. In this study, two aeration strategies (pile I-the optimized and pile II-the current) were established to investigate their impacts on the evolution of DOM and the microbial community in a full-scale sludge bio-drying plant. A higher pile temperature in pile I caused pile I to enter the DOM and microbiology stable stage approximately2 days earlier than pile II. The degradation of easily degradable components in the DOM primarily occurred in the thermophilic phase; after that degradation, the DOM components changed a little. Along with the evolution of the DOM, its main degradation driver, the microbial community, changed considerably. Phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were dominant in the thermophilic stage, and genus Ureibacillus, which was the primary thermophilic bacteria, was closely associated with the degradation of the DOM. In the mesophilic stage, the microbial community changed significantly at first and subsequently stabilized, and the genus Parapedobacter, which belongs to Bacteriodetes, became dominant. This study elucidates the interplay between the DOM and microbial community during sludge bio-drying.																	0175-7598	1432-0614				SEP	2015	99	17					7321	7331		10.1007/s00253-015-6640-z						WOS:000359739600030	25967653

Influence of dissolved organic matter on the photodegradation and volatilization kinetics of chlorpyrifos in coastal waters	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY												Irradiation by a medium-pressure mercury (Hg) lamp was used to study the photodegradation of chlorpyrifos (O,O-diethyl-O-3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2-yl phosphorothioate) in salt, deionized water (unbuffered), and a natural saline water. The UV irradiation produces 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) with accelerated photodegradation kinetics of the parent compound. The results show that chlorpyrifos photolysis followed pseudo-first-order kinetics in the presence and absence of salt with no significant difference between the photodegradation rates in saline waters and unbuffered deionized water. Addition of Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) to mimic the mixing of freshwaters with seawaters significantly changed the photodegradation rate constant of chlorpyrifos in saline waters. The influence of hydrolysis and volatilization was also evaluated. While photolysis was found to be the main transformation process in unbuffered deionized water, both volatilization and photolysis can be important pathways of chlorpyrifos loss in natural saline waters and under aerated conditions.

The photo-release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved nitrogen (DN), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were quantified over time. During the 5-7-day incubations, 3.4-12.4 and 23-41 % of the sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) and 2.8-10.2 and 25-46 % of the solid phase nitrogen (TN) were released into DOC and DN pools from Florida and Massachusetts salt marsh sediments, respectively. The suspended, fractionated, clay-sized particles from Massachusetts released much higher DOC and DN than Florida bulk sediment. Up to 65 % of the DOC and 100 % of the DN photo-released from sediments were respired rapidly by bacteria, indicating that microorganisms play an important role in regulating the concentration of DOC and DN. The bioavailability of photo-released DOC and DN also depends largely on the biochemical nature of the DOM released from different sediments. Optical measurements confirmed that significant CDOM production was associated with the sunlight-induced DOC release. Photo-released CDOM appeared to be marine and humic-like as characterized by fluorescence and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. It is estimated that photo-production of DOC from resuspended sediments could account for 10-22 % of the DOC measured in the coastal waters adjacent to the marsh systems studied. These results indicate that production of DOM from resuspended sediments due to direct sunlight irradiation could be an important source of DOC, CDOM, and secondary production in salt marshes and marsh-dominated coastal waters.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				SEP	2015	38	5					1692	1705		10.1007/s12237-014-9893-3						WOS:000358611500023

Mixing Behavior of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter and Its Potential Ecological Implication in the Caloosahatchee River Estuary, Florida	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one of the most important water quality constituents impacting light attenuation in estuaries; its concentration and distribution influence light quality and quantity available to phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation. By combining field surveys (March 2009-January 2011) and laboratory studies, we examined the estuarine mixing behavior of CDOM and potential loss processes affecting mixing behavior in the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE), Florida. The CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a (CDOM)(355), m(-1)) varied from 0.5 to 64 m(-1), with higher values in the upper estuary and lower values downstream, and increased with increasing freshwater inflow. CDOM exhibited three apparent mixing patterns with respect to hypothetical conservative mixing, with (1) conservative behavior or (2) addition at lower inflow and (3) loss at higher inflow. Laboratory studies indicated that flocculation was not a major loss process and that CDOM was susceptible to photolysis. The concentration of CDOM declined as a function of cumulative solar irradiation with a rate of similar to 0.003 m(2) mol(-1), suggesting a photobleaching half-life for CDOM of about 1 w. Apparent nonconservative mixing of CDOM increased or decreased light attenuation by 15-30 %, depending on freshwater inflow and location in the estuary. Light attenuation in the CRE was controlled primarily by CDOM in the upper estuary and by turbidity in the lower estuary, with the average contribution of CDOM to total light attenuation of 55 % (2-92 %) and turbidity of 23 % (3-79 %). The contribution of chlorophyll a (Chl a) to light attenuation was less than both CDOM and turbidity, accounting for about 12 % on average (2-24 %), regardless of location. These results suggest that any nutrient management scenario aimed at improving water clarity through reduction in Chl a concentration should consider the contributions of color and turbidity as well.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				SEP	2015	38	5					1706	1718		10.1007/s12237-014-9916-0						WOS:000358611500024

Samples from multiple seasons covered different hydrological regimes, including anomalously low-discharge conditions. The untargeted approach used allowed for identifying the DOM molecular signatures associated with different DOM sources in the estuary. DOM composition was strongly modulated by river discharge at monthly scales, with high river flow leading to significant increases in the terrigenous signature of the DOM throughout the estuary. During a severe/exceptional drought, estuarine DOM was imprinted with a distinct signature of marsh-derived compounds. The frequency of occurrence of anomalously low-discharge conditions seems to have increased over the last decades. If predictions of anthropogenically driven changes in hydroclimate are confirmed, they will likely be accompanied by changes in DOM composition in estuaries at multidecadal time scales.

Ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed 462 distinct brominated DBPs at a relative abundance in the mass spectra of more than 1%. A brominated DBP with a relative abundance of almost 22% was identified as 2,2,4-tribromo-5-hydroxy-4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione, which is an analogue to several previously described 2,2,4-trihalo-5-hydroxy-4-cyclopentene-1,3-diones in drinking water. Several other brominated molecular formulas matched those of other known brominated DBPs, such as dibromomethane, which could be generated by decarboxylation of dibromoacetic acid during ionization, dibromophenol, dibromopropanoic acid, dibromobutanoic acid, bromohydroxybenzoic acid, bromophenylacetic acid, bromooxopentenoic acid, and dibromopentenedioic acid. Via comparison to previously described chlorine-containing analogues, bromophenylacetic acid, dibromooxopentenoic acid, and dibromopentenedioic acid were also identified. A novel compound at a 4% relative abundance was identified as tribromoethenesulfonate. This compound has not been previously described as a DBP, and its core structure of tribromoethene has been demonstrated to show toxicological implications. Here we show that electrochemical disinfection, suggested as a-candidate for successful ballast water treatment, caused considerable production of some previously characterized DBPs in addition to novel brominated DBPs, although several hundred compounds remain structurally uncharacterized. Our results clearly demonstrate that electrochemical and potentially direct chlorination of ballast water in estuarine and marine systems should be approached with caution and the concentrations, fate, and toxicity of DBP need to be further characterized.

Developing Polycation-Clay Sorbents for Efficient Filtration of Diclofenac: Effect of Dissolved Organic Matter and Comparison to Activated Carbon	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The presence of nanoconcentrations of persistent pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater effluent and in surface water has been frequently reported. A novel organic inorganic hybrid sorbent based on adsorbing quarternized poly vinyl-pyridinium-co-styrene (QPVPcS) to montmorillonite (MMT) was designed for the removal of the anionic micropollutants. QPVPcS-clay composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR., thermal gravimetric analysis, Zeta potential and element analysis. Based on these measurements polymer clay micro- and nanostructures, as a function of polymer loading, were suggested. The affinity of the anionic pharmaceutical, diclofenac (DCF), to the composite was high and did not decrease dramatically with an increase of ionic strength, indicating that the interactions are not only electrostatic. The presence of humic acid (HA) did not hinder DCF removal by the composite; whereas, its filtration by granulated activated carbon (GAG) was compromised in the presence of HA. The kinetics and adsorption at equilibrium of DCF to the composite and to GAG were measured and modeled by the time dependent Langmuir equation. The adsorption of DCF to the composite was significantly faster than to GAG. Accordingly, the filtration of micro- and nanoconcentrations of DCF by composite columns, in the presence of HA, was more efficient than by GAG columns.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 4	2015	49	15					9280	9288		10.1021/acs.est.5b01530						WOS:000359278400042	26126078

Membrane separation technology has potential for use in treating process water for recirculation. The purpose of this study was to reveal the fouling characteristics of a polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membrane caused by dissolved organic matter (DOM) in process water. Ultrafiltration membranes (UF) and DAX ion exchange resins were applied to characterize the molecular weight (MW) and hydrophilicity distribution of DOM. The interactions between various fractions of DOM and a PES ultrafiltration membrane were investigated. The membrane fouling characteristics were elucidated by examining the filtration resistances and linearized Herman's blocking models. The results demonstrated that the membrane was fouled significantly by much of the MW distribution. The membrane was fouled more significantly by the low MW fraction rather than the high MW fraction. The filtration resistances and the fitted equation of Hermia's laws indicated that hydrophilic organics were the main foulants. The hydrophilic organics partially block the membrane pores and form intermediate blocking, reducing the effective filtration area, while the hydrophobic organics form a gel layer or cake on the surface of the membrane.																	1930-2126					AUG	2015	10	3					5906	5919								WOS:000364199800159

The relative influence of land cover, hydrology, and in-stream processing on the composition of dissolved organic matter in boreal streams	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Low-order boreal streams are particularly sensitive interfaces where dissolved organic matter (DOM) is transported from soils to inland waters. Disentangling the relative influence of key environmental factors suspected to influence stream water DOM composition is highly relevant to predicting the reactivity and fate of terrestrial DOM entering inland waters. Here we examined changes to DOM composition using absorbance and fluorescence, from 17 boreal streams ranging from first to fourth orders, over 14 months, including the rarely studied winter season, and two snowmelt periods (n = 836). We also analyzed soil pore water samples from three forest soil lysimeters to a depth of 70 cm (n = 60). Of five identified fluorescing parallel factor analysis components, two (C4 and C5) expressed a clear mire wetland or forest signature, providing distinct molecular markers of dominant land cover. In fact, land cover alone explained 49% of the variability in DOM composition. In contrast, seasonal fluctuations in hydrology only contributed to minor shifts (8%) in the composition of stream water DOM, while in-stream transformations to DOM composition were undetectable. These findings suggest that low-order boreal streams act as a passive pipe, since in-stream processing of DOM is restricted by short water residence times (6 h to 2 days). In addition, we demonstrated the sensitivity of optical approaches to distinguish between key terrestrial sources of DOM in the boreal landscape. By distinguishing the proportional leverage of key environmental controls on headwater stream DOM composition, we are better equipped to predict where and when key DOM transformations occur in the aquatic conduit.

In the Arctic Ocean, CDOM is abundant because of major input by large rivers. To better understand the processes that drive variations in CDOM, light absorption coefficients of CDOM [a(CDOM)(lambda),m(-1)] were extensively documented together with temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, nitrate concentrations, and bacterial production (BP) and abundance (BA) in the Western Arctic Ocean (WAO) from early to late summer as part of the MAUNA and the ICESCAPE expeditions. The data set covered contrasting situations, from bloom to post-bloom conditions and from river-influenced to oceanic water masses. While CDOM photobleaching occurred in the surface layer (< 20 m), we observed significantly lower spectral slopes for CDOM absorption spectra (S-CDOM) in addition to higher a(CDOM)(440) in the layer below (intermediate layer: 30.7 < salinity <33.9). In particular, the low S-CDOM values were found in the Chukchi Sea and the western part of the Beaufort Sea, which coincided with high BP and BA values. Considering the high primary production observed in these areas during our cruises (Arrigo et al., 2012. Science. 10.1126/science.1215065), we hypothesize that S-CDOM variations reflect the degradation of phytoplankton that is associated with heterotrophic bacterial activity. In our datasets, a simple regression analysis showed that S-CDOM was significantly correlated with BP and BA. A principal component analysis further supported this conclusion. From our field observations, it was shown that variations in a(CDOM)(440) and S-CDOM result to a large extent from bacterial activity, at least in the WAO. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Delgado-Moreno, L; Wu, LS; Gan, J				Delgado-Moreno, Laura; Wu, Laosheng; Gan, Jay			Application of isotope dilution method for measuring bioavailability of organic contaminants sorbed to dissolved organic matter (DOM)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Natural waters such as surface water and sediment porewater invariably contain dissolved organic matter (DOM). Association of strongly hydrophobic contaminants (HOCs) with DOM leads to decreased toxicity and bioavailability, but bioavailability of DOM-sorbed HOCs is difficult to measure. Current methods to estimate bioavailability of HOCs in water are based on only the freely dissolved concentration (C-free). The ignorance of the exchangeable fraction of HOCs sorbed on DOM may result in an underestimation of the toxicity potential of HOCs to aquatic organisms. Here we explore the applicability of an isotope dilution method (IDM) to measuring the desorption fraction of DOM-sorbed pyrene and bifenthrin and determining their exchangeable pool (E) as an approximation of bioavailability. E values, expressed as percentage of the total concentration, ranged between 0.80 and 0.92% for pyrene and 0.74 and 0.85% for bifenthrin, depending primarily on the amount of chemical in the freely dissolved form. However, between 34 and 78% of the DOM-sorbed pyrene was exchangeable. This fraction ranged between 23% and 82% for bifenthrin. The ability of IDM to predict bioavailability was further shown from a significant relationship (r(2) >0.72, P< 0.0001) between E and bioaccumulation into Daphnia magna. Therefore, IDM may be used to improve the bioavailability measurement and risk assessment of HOCs in aquatic systems.

Three humic-like components (C1, C2, and C4) and two protein-like components (C3 and C5) were identified. Fluorescent intensity showed more apparent temporal changes than spatial changes, and humic-like substances were dominant. The C3, C4, and C5 components decreased from November 2011 to October 2012, indicating effective CDOM removal by the water quality mitigation measures. Significant positive correlations were found between fluorescent components (C3 and C5) and nutritional factors including TN, NH4+-N, and NO3--N. Furthermore, changes of fluorescent components (C2) were found to be related to microbial phosphatase activities. The application of EEMs-PARAFAC presents a promising approach to track the compositions and spatio-temporal changes of CDOM in urban rivers.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				AUG	2015	43	8					1128	1135		10.1002/clen.201400277						WOS:000359083500002

The river as a chemostat: fresh perspectives on dissolved organic matter flowing down the river continuum	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A better understanding is needed of how hydrological and biogeochemical processes control dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition from headwaters downstream to large rivers. We examined a large DOM dataset from the National Water Information System of the US Geological Survey, which represents approximately 100 000 measurements of DOC concentration and DOM composition at many sites along rivers across the United States. Application of quantile regression revealed a tendency towards downstream spatial and temporal homogenization of DOC concentrations and a shift from dominance of aromatic DOM in headwaters to more aliphatic DOM downstream. The DOC concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships at each site revealed a downstream tendency towards a slope of zero. We propose that despite complexities in river networks that have driven many revisions to the River Continuum Concept, rivers show a tendency towards chemostasis (C-Q slope of zero) because of a downstream shift from a dominance of hydrologic drivers that connect terrestrial DOM sources to streams in the headwaters towards a dominance of instream and near-stream biogeochemical processes that result in preferential losses of aromatic DOM and preferential gains of aliphatic DOM.

The sequential SOM releasing evidenced by fluorescence and H-1-NMR profiles coupled with aqueous DOM solubilization was found to make sorption kinetics atypical and sorption capacity reduced, by comparing sorption results among sediments of different pretreatments. More importantly, the tested S was proved less humified with inherent DOM rich in microbial sources than P, and DOM affinity to phenanthrene was thus weakened (K-doc values of 2.02-3.63 x 10(4) L kg(-1)), while the inhibitive effects of SOM releasing on sorption were strengthened, ascribing to the enlarged alterations of sediment characters, and particularly the amplified solubilization effects resulted from the larger proportion of soluble SOM and lower critical micelle concentration (5.66 mg L-1) of DOM. Moreover, relative contribution of DOM solubilization to the releasing effects enhanced from 0.67 for P to 0.78 for S relative to alterations of sediment characters. Consequently, mobility and exposure risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons would be enhanced in a plant-soil/sediment-water system.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2015	22	15					11955	11965		10.1007/s11356-015-4418-6						WOS:000358330800067	25869431	
J	Han, XM; Liu, YR; Zhang, LM; He, JZ				Han, Xue-Mei; Liu, Yu-Rong; Zhang, Li-Mei; He, Ji-Zheng			Insight into the Modulation of Dissolved Organic Matter on Microbial Remediation of PAH-Contaminated Soils	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Microorganisms play a key role in degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in environments. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can enhance microbial degradation of PAHs in soils. However, it is not clear how will the soil microbial community respond to addition of DOM during bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils. In this study, DOMs derived from various agricultural wastes were applied to remediate the aging PAH-contaminated soils in a 90-day microcosm experiment. Results showed that the addition of DOMs offered a more efficient and persistent elimination of soil PAHs compared to the control which had no DOM addition. PAH removal effects were different among treatments with various DOMs; the addition of DOMs with high proportion of hydrophobic fraction could remove PAHs more efficiently from the soil. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) PAHs were more easily eliminated than that with high-molecular-weight (HMW). Addition of DOMs significantly increased abundance of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), pdo1, nah, and C12O genes and obviously changed community compositions of nah and C12O genes in different ways in the PAH-contaminated soil. Phylogenetic analyses of clone libraries exhibited that all of nah sequences and most of C12O sequences were affiliated into Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. These results suggested that external stimuli produced by DOMs could enhance the microbial degradation of PAHs in soils through not only solubilizing PAHs but also altering abundance and composition of indigenous microbial degraders. Our results reinforce the understanding of role of DOMs in mediating degradation of PAHs by microorganims in soils.

J	Chen, M; Hur, J				Chen, Meilian; Hur, Jin			Pre-treatments, characteristics, and biogeochemical dynamics of dissolved organic matter in sediments: A review	WATER RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediments, termed here sediment DOM, plays a variety of important roles in global biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients as well as in the fate and transport of xenobiotics. Here we reviewed sediment DOM, including pore waters and water extractable organic matter from inland and coastal sediments, based on recent literature (from 1996 to 2014). Sampling, pre-treatment, and characterization methods for sediment DOM were summarized. The characteristics of sediment DOM have been compared along an inland to coastal ecosystems gradient and also with the overlying DOM in water column to distinguish the unique nature of it. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from inland sediment DOM was generally higher than coastal areas, while no notable differences were found for their aromaticity and apparent molecular weight. Fluorescence index (FI) revealed that mixed sources are dominant for inland sediment DOM, but marine end-member prevails for coastal sediment DOM. Many reports showed that sediments operate as a net source of DOC and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) to the water column. Sediment DOM has shown more enrichment of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds in the elemental signature than the overlying DOM. Fluorescent fingerprint investigated by excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) further demonstrated the characteristics of sediment DOM lacking in the photo-oxidized and the intermediate components, which are typically present in the overlying surface water. In addition, the biogeochemical changes in sediment DOM and the subsequent environmental implications were discussed with the focus on the binding and the complexation properties with pollutants.

Characterization of biochars and dissolved organic matter phases obtained upon hydrothermal carbonization of Elodea nuttallii	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY												The invasive aquatic plant Elodea nuttallii was subjected to hydrothermal carbonization at 200 degrees C and 240 degrees C to produce biochar. About 58% w/w of the organic carbon of the pristine plant was translocated into the solid biochar irrespectively of the operating temperature. The process water rich in dissolved organic matter proved a good substrate for biogas production. The E. nuttallii plants showed a high capability of incorporating metals into the biomass. This large inorganic fraction which was mainly transferred into the biochar (except sodium and potassium) may hamper the prospective application of biochar as soil amendment. The high ash content in biochar (similar to 40% w/w) along with its relatively low content of organic carbon (similar to 36% w/w) is associated with low higher heating values. Fatty acids were completely hydrolyzed from lipids due to hydrothermal treatment. Low molecular- weight carboxylic acids (acetic and lactic acid), phenols and phenolic acids turned out major organic breakdown products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This dual role was systematically investigated through photochemical experiments with three types of DOM of terrestrial and aquatic origins that were preoxidized to varying extents by ozonation. The inhibitory effect of DOM was assessed by determining the 4-carboxybenzophenone photosensitized transformation rate constants of two sulfonamide antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine) in the presence of untreated or preoxidized DOM. The inhibitory effect decreased with the increasing extent of DOM preoxidation, and it was correlated to the loss of phenolic antioxidant moieties, as quantified electrochemically, and to the loss of DOM ultraviolet absorbance. The triplet photosensitizing ability of preoxidized DOM was determined using the conversion of the probe compound 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP), which is unaffected by DOM inhibition effects. The DOM photosensitized transformation rate constants of TMP decreased with increasing DOM preoxidation and were correlated to the concomitant loss of chromophores (i.e., photosensitizing moieties). The combined effects of DOM preoxidation on the inhibiting and photosensitizing properties were assessed by phototransformation experiments of the sulfonamides in DOM-containing solutions. At low extents of DOM preoxidation, the sulfonamide phototransformation rate constants remained either unchanged or slightly increased, indicating that the removal of antioxidant moieties had larger effects than the loss of photosensitizing moieties. At higher extents of DOM preoxidation, transformation rates declined, mainly reflecting the destruction of photosensitizing moieties.

We provide evidence for TDOC priming using a lab-based microcosm experiment in which TDOC was primed by the addition of C-13-labeled algal dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) or a C-13-labeled disaccharide (trehalose). The rate of TDOC remineralization to carbon dioxide (CO2) occurred 4.10.9 and 1.50.3 times more rapidly with the addition of trehalose and ADOC, respectively, relative to experiments with TDOC as the sole carbon source over the course of a 301h incubation period. Results from these controlled experiments provide fundamental evidence for the occurrence of priming of TDOC by ADOC and a simple disaccharide. We suggest that priming effects on TDOC should be considered in carbon budgets for large-river deltas, estuaries, lakes, hydroelectric reservoirs, and continental shelves.

Climate-driven terrestrial inputs in ultraoligotrophic mountain streams of Andean Patagonia revealed through chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fluvial networks transport a substantial fraction of the terrestrial production, contributing to the global carbon cycle and being shaped by hydrologic, natural and anthropogenic factors. In this investigation, four Andean Patagonian oligotrophic streams connecting a forested catchment (similar to 125 km(2)) and draining to a double-basin large and deep lake (Lake Moreno complex, Northwestern Patagonia), were surveyed to analyze the dynamics of the allochthonous subsidy. The results of a 30 month survey showed that the catchment supplies nutrients and dissolved organicmatter (DOM) to the streams. The eruption of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle at the beginning of the study overlapped with seasonal precipitation events. The largest terrestrial input was timed with precipitation which increased particulate materials, nutrients and DOM through enhanced runoff. Baseline suspended solids and nutrients were very low in all the streams (suspended solids: similar to 1 mg/L; total nitrogen: similar to 0.02 mg/L; total phosphorus: similar to 5 mu g/L), increasing several fold with runoff. Baseline dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC) ranged between 0.15 and 1 mg/L peaking up to three-fold. Chromophoric and fluorescent analyses characterized the DOM as of large molecular weight and high aromaticity. Parallel factor modeling (PARAFAC) of DOM fluorescence matrices revealed three components of terrestrial origin, with certain degree of microbial processing: C1 and C2 (terrestrial humic-like compounds) and C3 (protein-like and pigment derived compounds). Seasonal changes in MOD quality represent different breakdown stages of the allochthonous DOM. Our survey allowed us to record and discuss the effects of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle eruption, showing that due to the high slopes, high current and discharge of the streams the volcanic material was rapidly exported to the Moreno Lake complex. Overall, this survey underscores the magnitude and timing of the allochthonous input revealing the terrestrial subsidy to food webs in Patagonian freshwaters, which are among the most oligotrophic systems of the world.

Water mass age and aging driving chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the dark global ocean	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The omnipresence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the open ocean enables its use as a tracer for biochemical processes throughout the global overturning circulation. We made an inventory of CDOM optical properties, ideal water age (), and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) along the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean waters sampled during the Malaspina 2010 expedition. A water mass analysis was applied to obtain intrinsic, hereinafter archetypal, values of , AOU, oxygen utilization rate (OUR), and CDOM absorption coefficients, spectral slopes and quantum yield for each one of the 22 water types intercepted during this circumnavigation. Archetypal values of AOU and OUR have been used to trace the differential influence of water mass aging and aging rates, respectively, on CDOM variables. Whereas the absorption coefficient at 325nm (a(325)) and the fluorescence quantum yield at 340nm ((340)) increased, the spectral slope over the wavelength range 275-295nm (S275-295) and the ratio of spectral slopes over the ranges 275-295nm and 350-400nm (S-R) decreased significantly with water mass aging (AOU). Combination of the slope of the linear regression between archetypal AOU and a(325) with the estimated global OUR allowed us to obtain a CDOM turnover time of 634120years, which exceeds the flushing time of the dark ocean (>200m) by 46%. This positive relationship supports the assumption of in situ production and accumulation of CDOM as a by-product of microbial metabolism as water masses turn older. Furthermore, our data evidence that global-scale CDOM quantity (a(325)) is more dependent on aging (AOU), whereas CDOM quality (S275-295, S-R, (340)) is more dependent on aging rate (OUR).

While these changes can affect phytoplankton, the relative importance of each of these subsidies and how their effects vary with nutrient limitation patterns remain unclear. We investigated the effects of increasing N and DOM on phytoplankton in two relatively remote boreal regions of the northern US with lakes that differ in N and DOM concentrations: Acadia National Park (ACAD) in the northeastern US, and Isle Royale National Park (ISRO) in the north-central US. Nutrient enrichment assays were conducted in two lakes from each area first to assess nutrient limitation patterns. To determine the effects of increasing N and DOM, changes in phytoplankton biomass and community structure were examined in bioassay experiments using a N gradient combined with either DOM enrichment or DOM shading treatments. Algal biomass response indicated N limitation in ISRO and N&P co-limitation in ACAD. In the N gradient experiments, algal biomass in the N-limited lake increased along the N gradient, while it was unaffected in the N&P co-limited lake. Regardless of nutrient limitation pattern, algal biomass increased with DOM enrichment, with DOM additions primarily stimulating chlorophytes, diatoms, and chrysophytes. In contrast, shading with DOM had no effect on any phytoplankton response metrics. In boreal lakes, the effects of N enrichment were dependent on nutrient limitation status of the lake, whereas the effects of DOM enrichment were observed across lakes regardless of nutrient limitation status, suggesting that increasing DOM may have widespread effects on aquatic systems.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2015	77	3					511	521		10.1007/s00027-015-0396-5						WOS:000358863500015

Chromophoric (CDOM) and fluorescent (FDOM) properties were analyzed by spectrophotometry, and chemical signatures were obtained by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). E-DOM was more heterogeneous regarding optical characteristics as indicated by the presence of multiple CDOM peaks and the more even distribution of FDOM components, and had less absolute and relative numbers for molecular formulae containing nitrogen (N) than I-DOM. E-DOM was more photolabile, with greater photochemical removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CDOM and FDOM, and exhibited more pronounced photochemical alterations in molecular formulae composition than I-DOM. E-DOM was less biolabile, with less biological removal of DOC, CDOM, and protein-like fluorescent material, and supported lower rates of bacterial productivity than I-DOM. Phototransformations reduced the bioavailability of E-DOM and I-DOM, as shown by lower bacterial productivity and longer DOC and CDOM half-lives in bioassays with photoirradiated DOM in comparison to those with nonirradiated DOM. Analyses of CDOM, FDOM, and FTICR-MS revealed that the decrease in bioavailability was caused primarily by photolysis of the biolabile DOM, indicating competition between photochemical and biological removal of cyanobacterial DOM. These results provided insights into mechanistic effects of independent and combined photochemical and biological degradation on M. aeruginosa-derived DOM.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2015	60	4					1172	1194		10.1002/lno.10090						WOS:000357894500007

In the Eastern Mediterranean such systems are also particularly vulnerable to climate change, posing additional challenges for integrated water resources management. Comprehensive measurements of the optical signature of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were combined with measurements of river discharges and water physicochemical and biogeochemical properties, to assess carbon dynamics, water quality, and anthropogenic influences in a major transboundary system of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Evros (or, Ma?a or, Meric) river and its Ramsar protected coastal wetland. Measurements were performed over three years, in seasons characterized by different hydrologic conditions and along transects extending more than 70 km from the freshwater end-member to two kilometers offshore in the Aegean Sea. Changes in precipitation, anthropogenic dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs from the polluted Ergene tributary, and the irregular operation of a dam were key factors driving water quality, salinity regimes, and biogeochemical properties in the Evros delta and coastal waters. Marsh outwelling affected coastal carbon quality, but the influence of wetlands was often masked by anthropogenic DOM contributions. A distinctive five-peak CDOM fluorescence signature was characteristic of upstream anthropogenic inputs and clearly tracked the influence of freshwater discharges on water quality. Monitoring of this CDOM fluorescence footprint could have direct applications to programs focusing on water quality and environmental assessment in this and other transboundary rivers where management of water resources remains largely ineffective.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2015	60	4					1222	1240		10.1002/lno.10092						WOS:000357894500010

Thus DOM and its components play an important role in the environmental risk in the soil ecosystem and groundwater environment. Currently, most studies focused on the short-term effect of high concentration of DOM on the pesticide residues. However, soil DOM is mainly at low level. Therefore, there is of some practical significance to probe into the environmental behavior of soil pesticides under natural level of DOM. Thus a site investigation was conducted in the farmland with long-term application history of pesticide. By using the three dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence matrix (3D-EEM) technology, together with the fluorescence regional integration (FRI) quantitative method, the long-term effects of pesticide residues under low concentration of natural DOM were analyzed. Results showed that: (1) The long-term effects of the natural DOM components on the environment behavior of most soil organo-chlorine pesticides were not significant except for a few pesticides such as gamma-HCH, p,p'-DDE, etc. (2) The influencing effects of DOM components on different type of pesticides were varied. Among which, the content of tyrosine component showed a significantly negative correlation (p<0. 05) with the concentration of gamma-HCH and p, p'-DDE. There were significant positive correlations (p<0. 05) between the by-products of microbial degradation in DOM components and the concentration of heptachlor. There were also a significant positive correlation (p<0. 05) between the content of active humus component of humic acid in the DOM and the concentration of heptachlor epoxide. These results suggested that the distribution of different types of pesticides residue in the soil was influenced by different components at different levels of significance. (3) The humification degree of soil organic matter showed minor effect of DOM on the pesticide residues in the soil. In this study, 3D-EEM and FRI technology were firstly coupled in use for studying the influence of different components of DOM in soil on the environmental behavior of pesticides, which provides a new idea for the research on the mechanism of pesticides transportation and transformation in soil and groundwater environment.																	1000-0593					JUL	2015	35	7					1926	1932		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)07-1926-07						WOS:000357761200034		
J	Fan, CH; Zhang, YC; Wang, JH				Fan Chun-hui; Zhang Ying-chao; Wang Jia-hong			Effect of pH on the Ultraviolet Spectra and Fluorescence Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Process of Straw Humification	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Crop straw is the dominant by-product from agriculture and is regarded as the new source of non-point contamination. Straw incorporation is possible to solve the issues of straw reduction and reutilization, which is clearly required in the twelfth five-year-plan for national economic and social development of the People's Republic of China. At present, it is of noticeable lack of the investigation on straw incorporation behavior and detail humification product analysis in the representative regions under different environmental conditions. The ultraviolet and fluorescence spectrometry were used to reveal the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM), affected by pH values, in the straw humification process in loess region. The results showed: the ultraviolet absorbance of DOM samples increased firstly and then decreased with the increasing wavelength from 200 to 700 nm, and the maximum absorbance peaks appeared around the wavelength of 240 nm. The maximum absorbance peaks (Am.) were greater at pH values of 6, 8 and 9 than that of 7, and the low degree of humification was indicated from the values of SUVA(254), E-3 /E-4 and A(253) / A(203) caused by the short period of humification. The fluorescence peaks of extracted DOM from loess appeared around the regions of lambda(ex/em) =250/330 and lambda(ex/em) =325/450, referred as UV fulvic-like fluorescence, and visible fulvic-like and humic-like fluorescence, respectively. The increasing pH values resulted in the greater wavelength of absorbance peak, suggesting the increased aromaticity and conjugated degree, and the novel fluorescence peak was found in lambda(ex/em) =250/450. The pH values were more effective to change the UV fulvic-like fluorescence peaks intensity (increased firstly and then decreased) than that of visible fulvic-like and humic-like fluorescence, which might be related to buffer effect, fluorescence quenching (side effects) and component structure. The ultraviolet and fluorescence spectrometry were acceptable to illustrate the characteristics variation of DOM affected by pH values in the straw humification process.																	1000-0593					JUL	2015	35	7					1933	1937		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)07-1933-05						WOS:000357761200035

The objective of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that DOM is an adequate indicator of soil quality. To test this, the soil quality indices (SQI) of 190 arable soils from a Hungarian dataset were estimated, and these values were compared to DOM parameters (DOC and SUVA254). A clear difference in soil quality was found between the soil types, with low soil quality for arenosols (average SQI 0.5) and significantly higher values for gleysols, vertisols, regosols, solonetzes and chernozems. The SQI-DOC relationship could be described by non-linear regression, while a linear connection was observed between SQI and SUVA. The regression equations obtained for the dataset showed only one relatively weak significant correlation between the variables, for DOC (R-2 = 0.157***; n = 190), while nonsignificant relationships were found for the DOC and SUVA(254) values. However, an envelope curve operated with the datasets showed the robust potential of DOC to indicate soil quality changes, with a high R-2 value for the envelope curve regression equation. The limitations to using the DOM fraction of soils as a quality indicator are due to the contradictory processes which take place in soils in many cases.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2015	187	7								10.1007/s10661-015-4700-6						WOS:000357340500087

Molecular weight (MW) distribution and fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were discussed to study the characteristics. The experiment showed that the removal rate of chemical oxygen demand (COD), five day biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) by the combined process were 92.8%, 87.8% and 98.0%, respectively. Humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) were the main fractions in raw leachate with 81.8% of the total COD concentration, while hydrophilic organic matter (HyI) was the dominant fraction in the final effluent of the combined process with 63.5% of the total COD concentration. After the combined treatment process, the removal rate of DOM and fractions HA, FA, HyI were 91.9%, 97.1%, 95.8% and 71.7%, respectively. Organic matters of MW < 2 k and MW > 100k were removed with 90.5% and 97.9% COD concentration after the treatment. The ultraviolet-visible spectra (UV-vis), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrices spectra (EEMs) indicated that benzene materials and phenol compounds were preferentially removed in air stripping. High MW matters, aromatic rings, conjugated moieties and some functional groups were mainly removed by Fenton. While small MW fractions, carboxylic acids, alcohols and protein-like materials were preferentially biodegraded via SBR. Fulvic-like and humic-like materials were mainly destroyed via Fenton oxidation and coagulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lead Bioavailability to Freshwater Microalgae in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter: Contrasting Effect of Model Humic Substances and Marsh Water Fractions Obtained by Ultrafiltration	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Years of experimentation in well-defined media has demonstrated that trace metal bioavailability should be best predicted by the concentration (or activity) of the free cation (free ion activity model, FIAM). In the particular case of lead, uptake of Pb by Chlorella kessleri has been, however, shown to be higher in the presence of the Suwannee River fulvic acid and Suwannee River humic acid as compared to what was predicted by the free ion concentrations [Pb2+]. In order to estimate whether such exceptions of the FIAM can be extended to other freshwater phytoplankton, we measured the biouptake of Pb by C. reinhardtii another model phytoplankton, in solution containing these two model humic substances and for which free Pb2+ concentrations were evaluated using an ion-exchange technique. Our results showed that Pb internalization by C. reinhardtii can be directly related to the [Pb2+] but that the deviation from the FIAM when using C. kessleri was still observed under the present experimental conditions. Indeed, when using freshly isolated colloidal fraction (> 3 kDa) of a marsh water and its photoaltered products, [Pb2+] measurements are shown to poorly predict Pb uptake by C. kessleri and surprisingly Pb uptake by C. reinhardtii.

J	Davison, W; Lin, C; Gao, Y; Zhang, H				Davison, William; Lin, Chun; Gao, Yue; Zhang, Hao			Effect of Gel Interactions with Dissolved Organic Matter on DGT Measurements of Trace Metals	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) has emerged as a powerful technique for obtaining information on the dynamics of chemical speciation and partitioning of a diverse range of solutes in natural waters. However, there have been concerns that adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the diffusive hydrogel could affect measurements, particularly of trace metals. Diffusive gels were exposed to solutions containing DOM from eight different sources and the adsorption of organic matter measured spectrophotometrically, both by its removal from solution and its accumulation on the gel. Both fulvic and humic acid extracted from water adsorbed slightly, but there was much more marked adsorption of humic acid extracted from a peaty soil. There was virtually no evidence of adsorption of DOM in filtered natural waters of various sources, including a lake, river and the porewaters of soils, even when the latter had high concentrations of humic substances. It appears that humic substances in solution, rather than those extractable from the solid phase of soils, do not adsorb markedly to the DGT diffusive hydrogel. DGT measurements of Cd were unaffected if their diffusive gels were pre-exposed to DOM in soil and surface waters, but DGT measurements of Cu were suppressed, especially if the pre-exposure had been to a water containing high concentrations of DOM. This effect on the DGT measurement is likely to be minimised by use of longer deployment times, but further work is required to establish the extent of such effects for a range of realistic conditions.

DOM extracted from five saline-alkali soil samples were studied by fluorescence quenching titrations combined with three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) spectra and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Modified Stern-Volmer model was used to calculate the conditional stability constant (K) and the percent of fluorophores (f %) participating in the complexation reaction. Three main fluorescent components in the DOM, e.g., fulvic-like (component 1), humic-like (component 2), and protein-like (component 3) were identified and characterized by fluorescence EEM-PARAFAC. Both the components 1 and 2 showed fluorescence quenching by gradual addition of Cu (II), while component 3 had no marked change in fluorescence intensity. The higher log K of DOM-Cu (II) complexes suggests that the DOM has a high Cu binding affinity. Meanwhile, humic-like components showed higher in the proportion of organic ligands than those of fulvic-like components in the DOM of saline-alkali soils. The fluorescence quenching titration using EEM-PARAFAC analysis allows for the assessment of metal ion interactions with specific fluorophores, and is a good approach to study the geochemical behavior of metal ions in saline-alkali soils and to provide a support for the management of saline-alkali soil environment.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				JUL	2015	15	7					1473	1482		10.1007/s11368-015-1113-7						WOS:000356368200003		
J	Li, Z; Wu, LH; Zhang, H; Luo, YM; Christie, P				Li, Zhu; Wu, Longhua; Zhang, Hao; Luo, Yongming; Christie, Peter			Effects of soil drying and wetting-drying cycles on the availability of heavy metals and their relationship to dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Variation in soil moisture content can change metal availability. However, the effects of soil drying during wetting-drying cycles on metal availability have been little investigated. Metal availability to an imposed sink can be assessed by the diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) technique. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the effects of the soil drying processes and previous soil moisture contents on metal availability using DGT. Two metal-polluted agricultural soils with contrasting pH (one acid and one calcareous) were collected from agricultural fields and were repeatedly phytoextracted with a Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator. Both soils, with and without phytoextraction, were subjected to two soil drying processes, i.e. drying from flooded conditions to 50 % maximum water holding capacity (WHC) and drying from 100 to 30 % WHC. Changes in metal availability induced by changing soil water moisture were examined using DGT. In acid soils, the availability of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and nickel (Ni) (but not copper) increased with drying from saturation to 50 % WHC. Drying soil from 100 to 30 % WHC had weak or no significant effects on available metals. Availabilities of Cd, Ni and Zn correlated well with available Al for both drying conditions. In calcareous soil, a decreasing trend of metal availability with soil drying from saturation to 50 % WHC or from 100 to 30 % WHC was found. Soils were also subjected to different wetting-drying cycles prior to drying. In acid soil, available copper (Cu) was correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Available Cd, Ni and Zn were correlated with available Al and increased with soil wetting-drying cycles in phytoextracted soil, but not in non-remediated soil. In calcareous soil, available Cu and Ni were correlated well with DOC and were higher with long dry periods. However, available Cd and Zn were lower in soils dried from the cycle of saturation to 50 % WHC. The results indicate that soil water regimes can be manipulated to alleviate soil metal availability, but they must be tailored to individual metals and different soil types, and soil moisture content before drying should be considered when dried soils are used for evaluation of metal availability.

Two protein-like components and three humic-like components were identified. Three humic-like components decreased linearly with increasing salinity (r>0.90, p<0.001), suggesting their distribution could primarily be controlled by physical mixing. By contrast, two protein-like components fell below the theoretical mixing line, largely due to microbial degradation and removal during mixing. Higher concentrations of humic-like components found in 2012 could be attributed to higher freshwater discharge relative to 2013. There was a lack of systematic patterns for three humic-like components between seasons and years, probably due to variations of other factors such as sources and characteristics. Highest concentrations of fluorescent components, observed in estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region, could be attributed to sediment resuspension and subsequent release of DOM, supported by higher concentrations of fluorescent components in bottom water than in surface water at two stations where sediments probably resuspended. Meanwhile, photobleaching could be reflected from the changes in the ratios between fluorescence intensity (Fmax) of humic-like components and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) absorption coefficient (a355) along the salinity gradient. This study demonstrates the abundance and composition of DOM in estuaries are controlled not only by hydrological conditions, but also by its sources, characteristics and related estuarine biogeochemical processes.

Temperature Dependence of Photodegradation of Dissolved Organic Matter to Dissolved Inorganic Carbon and Particulate Organic Carbon	PLOS ONE												Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been studied for more than two decades. Usually, laboratory or "in-situ" experiments are used to determine photodegradation variables. A common problem with these experiments is that the photodegradation experiments are done at higher than ambient temperature. Five laboratory experiments were done to determine the effect of temperature on photochemical degradation of DOM. Experimental results showed strong dependence of photodegradation on temperature. Mathematical modeling of processes revealed that two different pathways engaged in photochemical transformation of DOM to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) strongly depend on temperature. Direct oxidation of DOM to DIC dominated at low temperatures while conversion of DOM to intermediate particulate organic carbon (POC) prior to oxidation to DIC dominated at high temperatures. It is necessary to consider this strong dependence when the results of laboratory experiments are interpreted in regard to natural processes. Photodegradation experiments done at higher than ambient temperature will necessitate correction of rate constants.

Leigh; Koch, Boris P.; Gonsior, Michael; Jaffe, Rudolf			Dynamics of dissolved organic matter in fjord ecosystems: Contributions of terrestrial dissolved organic matter in the deep layer	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Annually, rivers and inland water systems deliver a significant amount of terrestrial organic matter (OM) to the adjacent coastal ocean in both particulate and dissolved forms; however, the metabolic and biogeochemical transformations of OM during its seaward transport remains one of the least understood components of the global carbon cycle. This transfer of terrestrial carbon to marine ecosystems is crucial in maintaining trophic dynamics in coastal areas and critical in global carbon cycling. Although coastal regions have been proposed as important sinks for exported terrestrial materials, most of the global carbon cycling data, have not included fjords in their budgets. Here we present distributional patterns on the quantity and quality of dissolved OM in Fiordland National Park, New Zealand. Specifically, we describe carbon dynamics under diverse environmental settings based on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) depth profiles, oxygen concentrations, optical properties (fluorescence) and stable carbon isotopes. We illustrate a distinct change in the character of DOC in deep waters compared to surface and mid-depth waters. Our results suggest that, both, microbial reworking of terrestrially derived plant detritus and subsequent desorption of DOC from its particulate counterpart (as verified in a desorption experiment) are the main sources of the humic-like enriched DOC in the deep basins of the studied fjords. While it has been suggested that short transit times and protection of OM by mineral sorption may ultimately result in significant terrestrial carbon burial and preservation in fjords, our data suggests the existence of an additional source of terrestrial OM in the form of DOC generated in deep, fjord water.

However, the triplet-mediated reaction mechanism was poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the reaction adopting sulfadiazine as a representative SA and 4-carboxybenzophenone (CBBP)as a proxy of DOM. Results showed that the excited triplet state of CBBP ((CBBP)-C-3*) is responsible for the photodegradation of sulfadiazine. The reaction of (CBBP)-C-3* with substructure model compounds verified there are two reaction sites (amino-or sulfonyl-N atoms) of sulfadiazine. Density functional theory calculations were performed, which unveiled that electrons transfer from the N reaction sites to the carbonyl oxygen atom of (CBBP)-C-3* moiety, followed by proton transfers, leading to the formation of sulfadiazine radicals. Laser flash photolysis experiments were performed to confirm the mechanism. Thus, this study identified that the photodegradation mechanism of SAs initiated by (DOM)-D-3*, which is important for understanding the photochemical fate, predicting the photoproducts, and assessing the ecological risks of SAs in the aquatic environment.

Inputs of DOC and CDOM are predicted to increase with climate change, affecting coastal ecosystems. We found that the relationships between DOC, CDOM, salinity, and Secchi depth all differed between the two coastal areas studied; the W Gulf of Bothnia with high terrestrial input and the NW Baltic Proper with relatively little terrestrial input. The CDOM: DOC ratio was higher in the Gulf of Bothnia, where CDOM had a greater influence on the Secchi depth, which is used as an indicator of eutrophication and hence important for Baltic Sea management. Based on the results of this study, we recommend regular CDOM measurements in monitoring programmes, to increase the value of concurrent Secchi depth measurements.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				JUN	2015	44			3	SI		S392	S401		10.1007/s13280-015-0658-4						WOS:000362290800007	26022322

Despite marine bacteria being critical drivers of marine carbon cycling, knowledge of compositional responses within bacterioplankton communities to such disturbances is strongly limited. Using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, we examined bacterioplankton population dynamics in Baltic Sea mesocosms with treatments combining terrestrial DOM enrichment and increased temperature. Among the 200 most abundant taxa, 62 % either increased or decreased in relative abundance under changed environmental conditions. For example, SAR11 and SAR86 populations proliferated in combined increased terrestrial DOM/temperature mesocosms, while the hgcI and CL500-29 clades (Actinobacteria) decreased in the same mesocosms. Bacteroidetes increased in both control mesocosms and in the combined increased terrestrial DOM/temperature mesocosms. These results indicate considerable and differential responses among distinct bacterial populations to combined climate change effects, emphasizing the potential of such effects to induce shifts in ecosystem function and carbon cycling in the future Baltic Sea.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				JUN	2015	44			3	SI		S402	S412		10.1007/s13280-015-0659-3						WOS:000362290800008	26022323

More than 96% of the marine DOM resists microbial degradation for thousands of years. The composition of this refractory DOM (RDOM) exhibits a molecular signature ubiquitously detected in the deep oceans. Surprisingly efficient microbial transformation of labile into stable forms of DOM has been shown previously, implying that microorganisms apparently produce far more RDOM than needed to sustain the global pool. Here we show, by assessing the microbial formation and transformation of DOM in unprecedented molecular detail for 3 years, that most of the microbial DOM is different from RDOM in the ocean. Only <0.4% of the net community production is channelled into a form of DOM that is undistinguishable from oceanic RDOM.

This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2015	22	12					9173	9183		10.1007/s11356-015-4078-6						WOS:000356453000033	25586618

The study focused on the role of DOM in the transport of these micropollutants from parcels to surface waters (river, lake). Soil solution and river water samples were collected in the Lavaux vineyard area, western Switzerland. Their fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEM) were decomposed using parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and compared to their content in glyphosate and copper. PARAFAC analysis of EEM of both types of samples showed the contribution of protein-like and humic-like fluorophores. In soil water samples, complexes between fulvic-like and humic-like fluorophores of DOM, copper, and glyphosate were likely formed. In surface water, DOM-copper and glyphosate-copper interactions were observed, but not between glyphosate and DOM.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2015	22	12					9284	9292		10.1007/s11356-015-4086-6						WOS:000356453000044	25592914	
J	Cheng, T; Saiers, JE				Cheng, Tao; Saiers, James E.			Effects of dissolved organic matter on the co-transport of mineral colloids and sorptive contaminants	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												Colloid-facilitated transport of contaminants in the vadose zone has important implications to groundwater quality, and has received considerable attention. Natural organic matter (NOM) is ubiquitous in subsurface environments, and its influence on mineral colloids and solute transport has been well documented. However, research on the influence of NOM on colloid-facilitated transport is limited. The objective of this paper is to elucidate the effects of NOM on colloid-facilitated transport of a radioactive contaminant (Cs-137) within partially-saturated sediments. Measurements made with re-packed columns reveal that Cs-137 mobility was low when mineral colloids were absent and was unaffected by the presence of NOM. The addition of mineral colloids to influent increased Cs-137 mobility, and effluent Cs-137 was dominated by the colloid-associated form. When NOM was added to systems that contained mineral colloids and Cs-137, the mobility of Cs-137 further increased. A mathematical model simulating colloid-facilitated transport showed that NOM increases Cs-137 transport by increasing colloid mobility and reducing the rate of Cs-137 adsorption to the porous medium.

The role of a specific lake ecosystem serving as a sink for CDOM was elucidated in Lake Taihu, China. The lake was divided into CDOM-enriched and CDOM-depleted regions based on principal component analysis (PCA) results. The spatial distribution of molecular size (M), spectral slope ratio (S-R) and humification index (HIX) of CDOM suggested that CDOM in Lake Taihu was mainly from exogenous sources. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified four components, including a microbially humic-like component (Cl), two protein-like components (0 and 0) and a terrestrial humic-like component (C4). Strong conservative mixing behaviors of C4 and C1 were observed in the lake, and River Yincun is likely responsible for high CDOM concentration in Zhushan Bay. Compared with C2, C3 seemed to be more independent of the terrestrial humic-like CDOM. HIX decreased and S-R increased significantly from the CDOM-enriched region to the CDOM-depleted region (t-test, p < 0.0001), indicating CDOM properties might have changed significantly during lake water translocation processes. Mean CDOM absorption coefficient a(350), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and summed fluorescence intensity of the four components in the CDOM-enriched region were significantly higher than in the CDOM-depleted region (t-test, p < 0.0001), indicating that a large quantity of CDOM might have been lost during eastward and southward flow in Lake Taihu. The estimated CDOM and DOC loss rates in Lake Taihu were 10.59 x 10(9) m(3) m(-1) yr(-1) and 16.91 x 10(3) t yr(-1), respectively. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Nguyen, HVM; Choi, JH				Hang Vo-Minh Nguyen; Choi, Jung Hyun			Changes in the dissolved organic matter leaching from soil under severe temperature and N-deposition	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In this study, we conducted growth chamber experiments using three types of soil (wetland, rice paddy, and forest) under the conditions of a severe increase in the temperature and N-deposition in order to investigate how extreme weather influences the characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) leaching from different soil types. This leachate controls the quantity and quality of DOM in surface water systems. After 5 months of incubation, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased in the range of 21.1 to 88.9 %, while the specific UV absorption (SUVA) values increased substantially in the range of 19.9 to 319.9 % for all of the samples. Higher increases in the SUVA values were observed at higher temperatures, whereas the opposite trend was observed for samples with N-addition. The parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) results showed that four fluorescence components: terrestrial humic-like (component 1 (C1)), microbial humic-like (component 2 (C2)), protein-like (component 3 (C3)), and anthropogenic humic-like (component 4 (C4)) constituted the fluorescence matrices of soil samples. During the experiment, labile DOM from the soils was consumed and transformed into resistant aromatic carbon structures and less biodegradable components via microbial processes. The principle component analysis (PCA) results indicated that severe temperatures and N-deposition could enhance the contribution of the aromatic carbon compounds and humic-like components in the soil samples.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2015	187	6							323	10.1007/s10661-015-4549-8						WOS:000355917300010	25944751

The existing research mainly focus on the quality of inlet and outlet water, rather than the purification and transformation behavior of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the treatment process of tannery wastewater. The UV spectra and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to detect the spectral characteristics of water samples in the treatment process, and it is analyzed that the formation process and the linear relationships between total fluorescence intensity and parameters. The results showed: the UV absorbance of DOM in wastewater increased firstly and then decreased with longer wavelength, and the wave peaks were found around the wavelength of 230 nm. The values of A(253)/A(203) and SUVA(254) increased firstly and then decreased, indicating the complex reaction process related to free substituent and aromatic rings. The fluorescence peaks appeared at the regions of lambda(ex/em)=320 similar to 350/440 similar to 460 and lambda(ex/em)=270 similar to 300/390 similar to 420, referred as visible humic-like and visible fulvic-like fluorescence, respectively. With the treatment process of tannery wastewater, the following fluorescence phenomenon were monitored, such as the blue-shift of humic-like fluorescence peak in the hydrolytic acidification tank, the appearance of tryptophan fluorescence peak in the second biochemical pond (lambda(ex/em)=290/340), the weak fluorescence peak in the fourth biochemical pond (lambda(ex/em)=350/520) and the stabilized fluorescence characteristics in the secondary sedimentation tank and water outlet. The achievements are helpful to investigate the degradation and formation behavior of water components, and significant for the fluorescence variation analysis in the treatment system. The removal rate of total fluorescence intensity of tannery wastewater fit better the removal rate of TOC with coefficient of r 0.835 5. The UV spectra and 3D-EEMs are effective to reveal the purification behavior and mechanism of tannery wastewater.																	1000-0593					JUN	2015	35	6					1587	1591		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)06-1587-05						WOS:000355883400026		
J	Zhang, X; Zhao, X; Gao, YT; Zhang, M				Zhang, Xue; Zhao, Xuan; Gao, Yutuan; Zhang, Meng			Combination of MIEXA (R) resin and ozonation for reduction of dissolved organic matter during aquifer recharge using municipal effluent	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Magnetic anion exchange resin treatment (MIEXA (R)), as well as ozonation, was applied as pretreatment for soil aquifer treatment (SAT). The removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from municipal effluent was characterized during these treatments. The DOM removal ratio increased with the increasing of MIEXA (R) resin dosage (5-20 mL/L), and a dosage of 5-10 mL/L was suggested for the SAT pretreatment. Under this dosage, 30 % DOC was removed from secondary effluent, which was much lower than those found with drinking water resources. The aromatic DOM with apparent molecular weight (AMW) ranging 2-5 kDa was preferentially removed by MIEXA (R), especially for aromatic proteins. Differently, ozonation preferentially destroyed larger AMW (> 10 kDa) DOM, especially for fulvic and humic acid-like materials. Better purifucation was achieved by combining the two technologies. With pretreatments (MIEXA (R), ozonation, and combined MIEXA (R)/ozonation), the DOM removals by SAT were significantly improved. The DOC and UV254 values were reduced by 40-77 % in SAT combined with pretreatments, compared with 20-30 % reduction by only SAT. Around 50% of the fluorescent DOM was reduced in SAT and MIEX/SAT systems, while higher reductions (76-84%) were achieved in ozonation/SAT and MIEX/Ozonation/SAT systems. Different modes were identified: ozonation improved SAT on removing DOM of 1.7-5.3 kDa, whereas MIEXA (R) treatment attributed to the removal of small AMW (0.5-1.7 kDa) DOM responsible for the absorbance peak at 300 nm. Based on the results, DOM removed by MIEXA (R) treatment is complementary with those removed by SAT and ozonation, and the best DOM purification was found in combined MIEXA (R)/ozonation/SAT.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2015	73	12					7781	7787		10.1007/s12665-014-3292-8						WOS:000355142800010		
J	Zhang, X; Zhao, X; Zhang, M				Zhang, Xue; Zhao, Xuan; Zhang, Meng			Characterization of persistent dissolved organic matter in municipal effluents after ozonation and soil aquifer treatment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated for municipal effluent treated by ozonation and soil aquifer treatment (SAT). The apparent molecular weight (AMW) distribution of DOM was characterized using high-pressure size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detector (OCD), ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescent detectors. Using OCD, the DOM in secondary effluent (SE) was mainly humic substance (50.2 %) and low AMW acids (45.4 %). Ozonation removed 55 % of low AMW acids, while SAT removed 58 % humic substances. Using UV detector, the aromatic DOM in SE was mainly medium AMW 1.2-5.5 kDa (60.8 %) and low AMW 0.4-1.2 kDa (38.5 %). Ozonation removed 65 % of medium AMW fraction, while SAT removed 17 % medium AMW and 29 % low AMW. Fulvic acids and soluble microbial products (SMPs) were monitored using fluorescent detector. Fulvic acids in SE were mainly AMW 0.7-4.6 kDa (76.5 %) and AMW < 0.5 kDa (19.5 %). SMPs in SE were mainly AMW 0.8-4.1 kDa (52.1 %) and AMW 0.4-0.8 kDa (33.8 %). Ozonation effectively removed most fractions (AMW > 0.4 kDa) by 76-100 %, while SAT could only remove less than 30 % of small AMW (0.2-0.8 kDa) fraction. For the whole system, the reductions of total peak areas were 78.6, 66.3, 81.3 and 85.1 % for OCD signals, aromatic DOM, fulvic acids and SMPs, respectively. Compared with SE, the percents of total humic substances, aromatic low AMW acids (0.4-1.2 kDa), SMPs with AMW of 0.4-1.1 kDa and fulvic acids with AMW of 0.5-4.6 kDa increased in the final effluent, indicating such DOM was more resistant during the treatments.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2015	73	12					7789	7794		10.1007/s12665-014-3692-9						WOS:000355142800011

The results showed that the groundwater DOM comprised protein-, fulvic-, and humic-like substances, and the protein-like component originated predominantly from microbial production. The groundwater pollution by landfill leachate enhanced microbial activity and thereby increased microbial by-product-like material such as protein-like component in the groundwater. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra combined with parallel factor analysis showed that the protein-like matter content increased from 2011 to 2012 in the groundwater, whereas the fulvic- and humic-like matter concentration exhibited no significant changes. In addition, synchronous-scan fluorescence spectra coupled with two-dimensional correlation analysis showed that the change of the fulvic- and humic-like matter was faster than that of the protein-like substances, as the groundwater flowed from upstream to downstream in 2011, but slower than that of the protein-like substance in 2012 due to the enhancement of microbial activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy combined with chemometric analysis can investigate groundwater pollution characteristics and monitor DOM dynamics in groundwater.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2015	22	11					8499	8506		10.1007/s11356-014-4029-7						WOS:000354960300048	25548024

In this study, the effect of a coal slag additive on the bulk removal of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in WWTP effluent during SAT operation was explored via the matrix configurations of both coal slag layer and natural soil layer. Azide inhibition and XAD-resins fractionation experiments indicated that the appropriate configuration designing of an upper soil layer (25 cm) and a mixture of soil/coal slag underneath would enhance the removal efficiency of adsorption and anaerobic biodegradation to the same level as that of aerobic biodegradation (31.7% vs 32.2%), while it was only 29.4% compared with the aerobic biodegradation during traditional 50 cm soil column operation. The added coal slag would preferentially adsorb the hydrophobic DOM, and those adsorbed organics could be partially biodegraded by the biomass within the SAT systems. Compared with the relatively lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet light adsorption at 254 nm (UV-254) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) removal rate of the original soil column (42.0%, 32.9%, and 28.0%, respectively), SSL2 and SSL4 columns would enhance the bulk removal efficiency to more than 60%. Moreover, a coal slag additive in the SAT columns could decline the aromatic components (fulvic-like organics and tryptophan-like proteins) significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Persistence of dissolved organic matter in lakes related to its molecular characteristics	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Whether intrinsic molecular properties or extrinsic factors such as environmental conditions control the decomposition of natural organic matter across soil, marine and freshwater systems has been subject to debate(1-3). Comprehensive evaluations of the controls that molecular structure exerts on organic matter's persistence in the environment have been precluded by organic matter's extreme complexity(4). Here we examine dissolved organic matter from 109 Swedish lakes using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy to investigate the constraints on its persistence in the environment. We find that degradation processes preferentially remove oxidized, aromatic compounds, whereas reduced, aliphatic and N-containing compounds are either resistant to degradation or tightly cycled and thus persist in aquatic systems. The patterns we observe for individual molecules are consistent with our measurements of emergent bulk characteristics of organic matter at wide geographic and temporal scales, as reflected by optical properties. We conclude that intrinsic molecular properties are an important control of overall organic matter reactivity.

The results showed that he absorption coefficient a (CDOM)(440) ranged from 0.37 m(-1) to 3.93 m(-1) with an average of 1.89 +/- 0.76 m(-1) (+/- SD) for the aggregated dataset, and S varied from 0.0048 nm(-1) to 0.0239 nm(-1) with an average of 0.0108 +/- 0.0040 nm(-1). A significant relationship between S and a (CDOM)(440) can be fitted with a power equation (S = 0.013 x a (CDOM)(440)(-0.42), R (2) = 0.612), excluding data from Geist Reservoir during high flow (12 April 2010) and the Morse Reservoir on 25 June 2010 due to a T-storm achieves even higher determination coefficient (R (2) = 0.842). Correlation analysis indicated that a (CDOM)(440) has strong association with inorganic suspended matter (ISM) concentration (0.231 < R-2 < 0.786) for each of the field surveys, and this trend followed the aggregated datasets (R (2) = 0.447, p < 0.001). In contrast, chlorophyll-a was only correlated with a (CDOM)(440) in summer and autumn (0.081 < R (2) < 0.763), indicating that CDOM is mainly from terrigenous sources in early spring and that phytoplankton contributed during the algal blooming season. The S value was used to characterize CDOM origin. The results indicate that the CDOM source is mainly controlled by hydrological variations, while phytoplankton originated organic matter also closely linked with CDOM dynamics in three productive reservoirs.

Effects of Ionic Strength on the Chromophores of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study examined effects of variations of the ionic strength (IS) on the absorbance of dissolved organic. matter (DOM). The measurements performed for DOM of allochthonous (Suwannee River humic and fulvic acids, SRHA and SRFA) and autochthonous (Pony Lake fulvic acid, PLFA) origin Showed that increases of IS (Which was controlled by additions of sodium perchlorate) from 0.001 to 03 mol/L were accompanied by increases of the absorbance of DOM. The extent of the increase of DOM absorbance observed at increasing IS was consistently greater at higher pH values, and it followed the order of PLFA < SRFA < SRHA. The absolute values of the spectral slopes of the log-processed absorbance spectra of DOM calculated for a 350 to 400 nm wavelength range decreased proportionally to the logarithm of IS values. This result was hypothesized to be indicative of the deprotonation of the DOM chromophores at increasing IS values, which was supported by model calculations showing that values of the spectral slopes were nearly linearly correlated with the extent of IS-induced deprotonation of the operationally defined phenolic groups in DOM.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 19	2015	49	10					5905	5912		10.1021/acs.est.5b00601						WOS:000355058300009	25897866

Contrasting Effects of Marine and Terrestrially Derived Dissolved Organic Matter on Mercury Speciation and Bioavailability in Seawater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Methylmercury (MeHg) is the only species of mercury (Hg) to biomagnify in aquatic food-webs to levels that are a widespread concern for human and ecological health. Here we investigate the association between dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater and Hg speciation and uptake using experimental data and field measurements from Long Island Sound (LIS) and the Northwestern Atlantic continental margin. We measured differences in DOM composition across sampling stations using excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and further separated DOM into terrestrial and marine components using Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). Highest MeHg concentrations were found in the estuarine stations (LIS) with highest DOM concentrations due to enhanced external inputs from the watershed and rivers. For stations on the shelf and slope, MeHg in plankton increased linearly with a decreasing fraction of fluorescence attributable to DOM components with a terrestrial rather than marine origin. These results are corroborated by experimental data showing higher MeHg uptake by cells in the presence of predominantly marine DOM compared to terrestrial DOM. Highest fractions of dissolved gaseous mercury were also found at stations with the highest marine DOM content, suggesting a greater reducible fraction of divalent inorganic Hg. These data suggest DOM composition is a critical driver of Hg reactivity and bioavailability in offshore marine waters.

It takes into account the decreasing reactivity of dissolved organic matter using a variable reaction rate coefficient (VRRC) which decreases with an increasing conversion. The concentration of reducing species is surrogated by the maximum chlorine demand. Temperature dependency, respectively, is described by the Arrhenius-relationship. The accuracy and adequacy of the proposed model to describe chlorine decay in bulk water were evaluated and shown for very different waters and different conditions such as water mixing or rechlorination by applying statistical tests.

The impact of a spectral variability stemmed from a diverse dataset on the representativeness of the PARAFAC model needs to be examined. In this study, samples from a river, effluent of a wastewater treatment plant, and algae secretion were collected and subjected to PARAFAC analysis. PARAFAC models of global dataset and individual datasets were compared. It was found that the peak shift derived from source diversity undermined the accuracy of the global model. The results imply that building a universal PARAFAC model that can be widely available for fitting new EEMs would be quite difficult, but fitting EEMs to existing PARAFAC model that belong to a similar environment would be more realistic. The accuracy of online monitoring strategy that monitors the fluorescence intensities at the peaks of PARAFAC components was examined by correlating the EEM data with the maximum fluorescence (F-max) modeled by PARAFAC. For the individual datasets, remarkable correlations were obtained around the peak positions. However, an analysis of cocktail datasets implies that the involvement of foreign components that are spectrally similar to local components would undermine the online monitoring strategy.

We thus investigated the abiotic transformation of sulfide upon reaction with reduced and nonreduced Sigma-Aldrich humic acid (HA), at pH 6 under anoxic conditions. Sulfide reacted with nonreduced HA at conditional rate constants of 0.227-0.325 h(-1). The main transformation products were elemental S (S-0) and thiosulfate (S2O32-), yielding electron accepting capacities of 2.82-1.75 mu mol e(-) (mg C)(-1). Native iron contents in the HA could account for only 6-9% of this electron transfer. About 22-37% of S reacted with the HA to form organic S (S-org). Formation of S-org was observed and no inorganic transformation products occurred for reduced HA. X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy supported S-org to be mainly zerovalent, such as thiols, organic di- and polysulfides, or heterocycles. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that HA can abiotically reoxidize sulfide in anoxic environments at rates competitive to sulfide oxidation by molecular oxygen or iron oxides.				peiffer, stefan/C-3759-2012; Yu, Zhi-Guo/A-5296-2016; Knorr, Klaus-Holger/B-8321-2008	peiffer, stefan/0000-0002-8326-0240; Knorr, Klaus-Holger/0000-0003-4175-0214												0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 5	2015	49	9					5441	5449		10.1021/es505531u						WOS:000354155800024	25850807	
J	Chu, CH; Lundeen, RA; Remucal, CK; Sander, M; McNeill, K				Chu, Chiheng; Lundeen, Rachel A.; Remucal, Christina K.; Sander, Michael; McNeill, Kristopher			Enhanced Indirect Photochemical Transformation of Histidine and Histamine through Association with Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Photochemical transformations greatly affect the stability and fate of amino acids (AAs) in sunlit aquatic ecosystems. Whereas the direct phototransformation of dissolved AAs is well investigated, their indirect photolysis in the presence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is poorly understood. In aquatic systems, CDOM may act both as sorbent for AAs and as photosensitizer, creating microenvironments with high concentrations of photochemically produced reactive intermediates, such as singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). This study provides a systematic investigation of the indirect photochemical transformation of histidine (His) and histamine by O-1(2) in solutions containing CDOM as a function of solution pH. Both His and histamine showed pH-dependent enhanced phototransformation in the CDOM systems as compared to systems in which model, low-molecular-weight O-1(2) sensitizers were used. Enhanced reactivity resulted from sorption of His and histamine to CDOM and thus exposure to elevated O-1(2) concentrations in the CDOM microenvironment. The extent of reactivity enhancement depended on solution pH via its effects on the protonation state of His, histamine, and CDOM. Sorption-enhanced reactivity was independently supported by depressed rate enhancements in the presence of a cosorbate that competitively displaced His and histamine from CDOM. Incorporating sorption and photochemical transformation processes into a reaction rate prediction model improved the description of the abiotic photochemical transformation rates of His in the presence of CDOM.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for qualitative detection of humic substances and dissolved organic matter in mineral soils and peats in Lithuania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with size exclusion (SEC) separation function was used to isolate and examine the molecular mass (MM) distributions and polydispersity of humic substances (HSs) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from mineral soils and peats. The aim was to improve their detailed characterisation and to inform of their soil carbon (C) sequestration and environmental quality. This is the first study conducted in Lithuania in which HSs and DOM, separated from two soil types, have been used to characterise soil at the molecular level. The HPLC-SEC, as a separation method, was coupled with diode-array detection (DAD), thus enabling the separation of molecular fractions. Results showed that HPLC-SEC can be used to determine the MM of HSs in soil, provided that the relation between retention time and MM is known and a suitable method for fitting the HS peak is available. The UV-spectra analysis showed that DOM has a larger MM (M-w=2439-3436Da), which contains more aliphatic C. The HS fraction has a smaller MM (M-w=2776Da), with aromatic structures that reflect a higher aromaticity. Separated fractions had characteristic MMs of humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) and DOM. The HSs separated from peat samples were characterised by higher aromaticity, humification and stability. The HSs extracted from mineral soil samples showed a higher degradability level. The results also show the MM distribution and polydispersity of HS and DOM fractions (M-w/M-n=1.009-1.252) are relatively homogenous in both soil types. Findings confirm that chromatographic and spectrometric parameters can be used for characterisation of both HSs and DOM, and for detecting changes in organic matter quality. Moreover, they can also be used for a further understanding the C-cycle and could be applied for enhancing soil C-sequestration and informing environmental quality management.																	0306-7319	1029-0397				MAY 3	2015	95	6					508	519		10.1080/03067319.2015.1048435						WOS:000356354300003

The Amazon River exports large amounts of DOM, and yet the fate of this material in the ocean remains unclear. Here we investigate the molecular composition and transformations of DOM in the Amazon River-ocean continuum using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and geochemical and biological tracers. We show that there is a strong gradient in source and composition of DOM along the continuum, and that dilution of riverine DOM in the ocean is the dominant pattern of variability in the system. Alterations in DOM composition are observed in the plume associated with the addition of new organic compounds by phytoplankton and with bacterial and photochemical transformations. The relative importance of each of these drivers varies spatially and is modulated by seasonal variations in river discharge and ocean circulation. We further show that a large fraction (50-76%) of the Amazon River DOM is surprisingly stable in the coastal ocean. This results in a globally significant river plume with a strong terrigenous signature and in substantial export of terrestrially derived organic carbon from the continental margin, where it can be entrained in the large-scale circulation and potentially contribute to the long-term storage of terrigenous production and to the recalcitrant carbon pool found in the deep ocean.

Longitudinal shifts in dissolved organic matter chemogeography and chemodiversity within headwater streams: a river continuum reprise	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We tested a long-standing hypothesis within river ecology, predicted by the River Continuum Concept, that dissolved organic matter (DOM) diversity decreases with stream order. We measured DOM molecular composition across three stream orders in the headwaters of well characterized forested catchments with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to assess DOM chemogeography and chemodiversity over the spatial scales of climatic regions and fluvial networks. Stream waters with similar dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in different climatic regions had distinctive DOM compositions, but shared 69.5 % of the 3286 individual chemical formulae detected. DOM compositions common to all watersheds were characterized by abundant lignin-like and tannin-like molecules as well as carboxyl-rich alicyclic-like molecules (CRAM); 50 % of all formulae were found in all streams. Of the roughly 700 unique chemical formulae within a given fluvial network, most were outside the CRAM region within a van Krevelen diagram and 78 to 95 % were restricted to 1st-order streams where diffuse ground water sources surface, coalesce into a channel, and flow downstream. The 1st-order streams within a fluvial network also exhibited the highest formula diversity as well as the greatest numbers of formulae across a broad range of compound classes.

Negative and positive electrospray ion (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) was used to characterize the composition of DOM and its subfractions. Compounds with multi-oxygen atoms were found to be predominant in DOM by either negative or positive ESI analysis, which are similar in composition to most other treated water samples. The DOM in the HOA fraction had a similar molecular composition to that of raw process water by negative ESI analysis. The DOM in the HOB fraction had a low molecular weight (MW) when analyzed by positive ESI, and basic nitrogen compounds, such as N-1 class species, were found to be predominant. The DOM in the HON fraction was predominantly O-2 class species. The DOM in the HIS fraction had a relatively wide MW distribution. All of the compounds of DOM in the HIS fraction exhibited low double bond equivalents (DBE) and low carbon numbers. The results showed that the use of the XAD-8 resin fractionation technique is valuable for characterizing trace quantities of DOM components in process water because their spectral peaks would otherwise be obscured by other abundant peaks. The origin and determination of chlorine-containing compounds, which are abundant in the negative ESI mass spectra of HOB, were discussed.																	0887-0624	1520-5029				MAY	2015	29	5					2923	2930		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b00333						WOS:000355158200021

The reductions of 9-58% and 17-71% in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the removals of 30-75% and 30-83% in absorbance of ultraviolet light at 254 nm (UV-254) were obtained by coagulation of two secondary municipal effluents, respectively. Moreover, the order of DOC and UV-254 removals by coagulation was pH 5>pH 6>unadjusted pH at all coagulant dosages. The reductions of the bulk fluorescent materials by coagulation were lower than those of UV-254 absorbing compounds. Among four types of fluorophores, aromatic protein-like fluorophores were preferentially removed by coagulation. The coagulation treatability of hydrophobic acid (HPO-A) was the highest and that of hydrophilic fraction (HPI) was the lowest, among five DOM fractions. In addition, the value of specific ultraviolet light absorbance for each DOM fraction decreased significantly after coagulation. The Fourier-transform infrared spectra revealed that aromatics were effectively removed by coagulation while coagulation seemed to be inefficient in removing amide-2 functional groups and those hydrocarbons exhibiting absorbance characters at 2950-2850 cm(-1).

Changes in the composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter during sea ice formation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Arctic Ocean receives a large amount of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) from rivers and more than half of this is removed during its passage through the Arctic Ocean. Terrestrial DOM is generally believed to have a low bioavailability and recent studies point to physicochemical processes such as sea ice formation as the source of the significant DOM removal in the Arctic Ocean. We present the results of a mesocosm experiment designed to investigate how sea ice formation affects DOM composition and bioavailability. We measured the change in different fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) fractions in sea ice, brines (contained in small pores between the ice crystals), and the underlying seawater during a 14 d experiment. Two series of mesocosms were used: one with seawater alone and one with seawater enriched with humic-rich river water. Abiotic processes increased the humic-like FDOM signal in the seawater below the ice during the initial ice formation. Humic-like FDOM fractions with a marine signal were preferentially retained in sea ice (relative to salinity), whereas humic-like FDOM with a terrestrial signal behaved more conservatively with respect to salinity. Amino acid-like FDOM and an unknown FDOM component, only previously found in Antarctic brines, were associated with biological activity and possibly extracellular polymeric substances in sea ice. An additional long-term (226-228 d) bioassay experiment with seawater collected from the mesocosm experiment revealed that 11%+/- 2% of the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was bioavailable. However, 16%+/- 12% of DOC expelled from the ice into the seawater below was bioavailable and the bioavailability of DOC in brine was even higher at 45%. DOM is highly susceptible to physicochemical changes during sea ice formation, leading to modifications in composition and increased bioavailability, which can in part explain terrestrial DOC removal in the Arctic Ocean.

Urbanization changes the composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter in headwater streams	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Population growth in cities has resulted in the rapid expansion of urbanized land. Most research and management of stream ecosystems affected by urban expansion has focused on the maintenance and restoration of biotic communities rather than their basal resources. We examined the potential for urbanization to induce bottom-up ecosystem effects by looking at its influence on dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and bioavailability and microbial enzyme activity. We selected 113 headwater streams across a gradient of urbanization in central and southern Maine and used elemental and optical analyses, including parallel factor analysis of excitation-emission matrices, to characterize DOM composition. Results show that fluorescent and stoichiometric DOM composition changed significantly across the rural to urban gradient. Specifically, the proportion of humic-like allochthonous DOM decreased while that of more bioavailable autochthonous DOM increased in the more urbanized streams. In laboratory incubations, increased autochthonous DOM was associated with a doubling in the decay rate of dissolved organic carbon as well as increased activity of C-acquiring enzymes. These results suggest that urbanization replaces upstream humic material with more local sources of DOM that turnover more rapidly and may drive bottom-up changes in microbial communities and affect the quality and quantity of downstream DOM delivery.

Here, we investigated the dissolved organic carbon, fluorescent DOM (FDOM), and DOM molecules from riparian soils on Chongming Island in eastern China. Simultaneously, the soil DOM was extensively characterized in terms of the total aromaticity index (TAI) and several optical indices. The excitation (Ex) emission (Em) matrix parallel factor analysis results showed that two humic-like components were present (Ex/Em = 283(364)/454 nm; 337/410 nm), a fulvic-like component (Ex/Em = 241/426 nm) and a microbial degradation component (Ex/Em = 295/382 nm). The humic-like and fulvic-like substances were the main components in the riparian soil FDOM, accounting for similar to 90% of the FDOM. Mass spectrometry provided more detailed information for the soil DOM molecules. Six chemical fractions, amino acids, carbonyl compounds, fatty acids, lipids, proteins and sugars, were identified using liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Lipids, proteins, and carbonyl compounds were dominant in the soil DOM, accounting for >85% of the detected molecules (m/z < 1000). Significant differences were observed between the quantities of the six soil DOM chemical fractions at the different sampling locations. Discriminant molecules verified the hypothesis that the chemical soil DOM fractions varied with the land use of the adjacent watersheds. The TAI for the soil DOM could provide more reliable information regarding the biogeochemical processes of DOM. The carbonyl compounds and lipid fractions controlled this index. Overall, the optical indices and TAI values can improve our understanding of soil DOM quality; however, the optical indices did not provide quantitative evidence regarding the sources or properties of the soil DOM. The observations from this study provided detailed information regarding the soil DOM quality and the presence of specific molecules and improved our understanding of the biogeochemical processes of DOM.																	0003-7028	1943-3530				MAY	2015	69	5					623	634		10.1366/13-07407R						WOS:000354004500026	25909771

Utilization of PARAFAC-Modeled Excitation-Emission Matrix (EEM) Fluorescence Spectroscopy to Identify Biogeochemical Processing of Dissolved Organic Matter in a Northern Peatland	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												In this study, we contrast the fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fens and bogs in a Northern Minnesota peatland using excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). EEM-PARAFAC identified four humic-like components and one protein-like component and the dynamics of each were evaluated based on their distribution with depth as well as across sites differing in hydrology and major biological species. The PARAFAC-EEM experiments were supported by dissolved organic carbon measurements (DOC), optical spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and compositional characterization by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy (FT-ICR MS). The FT-ICR MS data indicate that metabolism in peatlands reduces the molecular weights of individual components of DOM, and oxygen-rich less aromatic molecules are selectively biodegraded. Our data suggest that different hydrologic and biological conditions within the larger peat ecosystem drive molecular changes in DOM, resulting in distinctly different chemical compositions and unique fluorescent fingerprints. PARAFAC modeling of EEM data coupled with ultrahigh resolution FT-ICR MS has the potential to provide significant molecular-based information on DOM composition that will support efforts to better understand the composition, sources, and diagenetic status of DOM from different terrestrial and aquatic systems.																	0031-8655	1751-1097				MAY-JUN	2015	91	3					684	695		10.1111/php.12448						WOS:000353981900022	25772776

The contaminants of tannery wastewater include macromolecular organic matters, such as grease, fur scraps and collagen, and the alkaline wastewater appears to be of high content of salt and COD. The quality of tannery wastewater is monitored strictly among all kinds of industry wastewater. In the treatment process of tannery wastewater, the quality of inlet and outlet water is generally analyzed. In fact, the transformation behavior of contaminants should be additionally checked to optimize the treatment conditions. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is commonly existed in water-bodies and helpful to understand the physicochemical characteristics, while the related work should be further studied on tannery wastewater. The approaches of elemental analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis (TG), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) were used to reveal the characteristics of DOM in the treatment process of tannery wastewater. The results showed: the carbon content of DOM samples increased gradually, atomic ratios of H/C increased firstly and then decreased, indicating the organic matters were decomposed into chain structures firstly, finally forming the component hard to degraded. The pyrolysis process of DOM mainly proceeded in the regions of 110 similar to 530 degrees C (aliphatic compound, protein, etc.) and 530 similar to 800 degrees C (aromatic ring, single bond of C-C, etc.). The functional groups of DOM included -OH, -NH2, C=O and so on, and the aromatic substances were detected, shown from FTIR figures, in the later period of the reaction, caused by the metabolism effect of micro-organism. The content of alkoxy-C increased to the maximum in the second biochemical pond, and the minimum content of aromatic-C appeared in the second biochemical pond, suggesting the transformation behavior of carbon functional groups. The investigation on DOM in tannery wastewater is significant to understand the purification mechanism of contaminants in tannery wastewater.																	1000-0593					MAY	2015	35	5					1203	1207		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)05-1203-05						WOS:000354142900011

Eight water samples were collected along the river across the centralized wastewater-discharge region and the dispersed wastewater-discharge region. Water quality had deeply deteriorated in the river. Based on DOM fluorescence spectroscopic properties, DOM was composed of tyrosine-like, tryptophan-like, soluble microbial by-product-like, fulvic-like and humic-like materials, among which protein-like material was dominant in the DOM fractions. The DOM in the centralized wastewater-discharge region had a lower level of aromaticity than that in the dispersed wastewater-discharge region, and its humification degree was lower than that in the latter too. Key factors for the trophic state contained NH4-N, DO, DOC, TP, Phi(2,n) and Phi(4,n) by multivariable analysis. DOM was mainly derived from treated and untreated industrial wastewater with weak biodegradability.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2015	73	9					5163	5171		10.1007/s12665-015-4269-y						WOS:000353803600030

Characterization of dissolved organic matter from a restored urban marsh and its role in the mobilization of trace metals	CHEMOSPHERE												Dissolved organic matter (DOM), although highly variable and not very well characterized, plays a role in many important environmental reaction and transport processes, including trace metal mobilization. This study characterizes heterogeneous DOM from the pore-water of a restored urban tidal marsh, using chemical, optical, and electrochemical methods for dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen ratios (C:N: 1.8-6.4), spectroscopic characteristics (decreased aromaticity in amended sediments), element ratios (maximum sediment-associated trace metal concentrations measured <30 cm), and metal complexation properties (logK(c),: Cd: 10.7 +/- 0.7 > Pb: 9.5 +/- 0.1 > Cr: 7.3 +/- 0.1 > Cu: 5.07 +/- 0.53), all as a function of sediment depth. Specific DOM properties from the restored marsh were then compared to pore-water samples from a natural marsh and a simulated wetland microcosm which resulted in similar values, while the reference humic acid significantly differed in properties from field DOM. The results revealed that reference humic acids do not accurately represent the complexity of natural heterogeneous DOM, whereas a simulated wetland microcosm may provide a reasonable representation of natural DOM. Clear differences between amended and original soil (transition below 30 cm) were observed in DOM and trace metal properties including: lower DOM content, higher logK(c) values, less DOM complexity, development of a iron-sulfide redox buffering pool, and greater affinity for metals in the solid phase occurring in the amended sediments.

J	Scaglia, B; Pognani, M; Adani, F				Scaglia, Barbara; Pognani, Michele; Adani, Fabrizio			Evaluation of hormone-like activity of the dissolved organic matter fraction (DOM) of compost and digestate	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Biomasses are usually applied to soil for their agronomic properties (fertilization and amendment properties). Biomass can also have bio-stimulating effects on plants because of the presence of hormones and hormonelike molecules. Although compost has been the subject for studies of this aspect, no data have yet been reported on the extraction of this kind of molecule from digestate biomass. The aim of this work is to study the auxin- and gibberellin-like activity of pig slurry digestate in comparison with those of pruning and garden wastes compost's dissolved organic fraction (DOM). DOM (i.e., fraction <0.45 mu m) is the most reactive among the organic matter fractions readily available to microbial and plant metabolism. No gibberellin-like activities were found for either compost or digestate, whereas digestate showed auxin-like properties which were found to be located in its neutral hydrophobic (NHo) DOM fractions. Hormone activity was due principally to the presence of auxin coming from the anaerobic digestion of aromatic amino acids. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gmurek, M; Olak-Kucharczyk, M; Ledakowicz, S				Gmurek, Marta; Olak-Kucharczyk, Magdalena; Ledakowicz, Stanislaw			Influence of dissolved organic matter in natural and simulated water on the photochemical decomposition of butylparaben	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Background: In the last few decades the quality of natural water has often deteriorated as a variety of novel pollutants have contaminated rivers and lakes. Trace amounts of some man-made chemicals can be hazardous to plants, animals as well as human health as carcinogens, mutagens or endocrine disruptors. Light radiation may help in its decomposition, aided by naturally occurring colored organic compounds (humic substances) in the water. The aim of these studies was to check the influence of presence of organic and inorganic matter on the removal of endocrine disrupting compound - butylparaben (BP) from water. Methods: Photochemical decomposition of BP in aqueous solution using: photolysis by ultraviolet-C (UVC) and visible (VIS) irradiation, advanced oxidation in H2O2/UV system and photosensitized oxidation was examined. The degradation processes were carried out in different type of water matrix: natural water from Sulejow Reservoir, simulated natural water with humic acids and buffered solution. Results: The presence of dissolved organic matter in water did not influence much on UVC photolysis and increases only about 8% of BP depletion rate in H2O2/UV system. While during visible light photolysis and photosensitized oxidation the addition of natural water matrix causes the acceleration of reaction rate by 16% and 36%, respectively. Moreover BP degradation proceeds via singlet oxygen generated from humic substances. Conclusions: Butylparaben undergoes both direct and indirect photodegradation in aqueous solution under UVC and visible radiation. The efficiency of the H2O2/UV process, photolysis as well as photosensitized oxidation processes is strongly dependent on composition of the water.

Temperature Dependence of the Photochemical Formation of Hydroxyl Radical from Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The temperature dependence of the photochemical production of the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) from dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated by measuring the apparent temperature dependence of the quantum yield (Phi(a)) for this process. Temperature dependent Phi(a) values were analyzed using the Arrhenius equation. Apparent activation energies obtained for DOM isolates purchased from the International Humic Substances Society ranged from 16 to 34 kJ mol(-1). Addition of 40 units mL(-1) catalase, used to hinder the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-dependent pathway to center dot OH, did not impact the observed activation energy. However, an increase in activation energy was observed in lower molecular weight DOM obtained by size fractionation. We also measured the temperature dependence of p-benzoquionone photolysis as a model compound for DOM and observed no temperature dependence (slope p = 0.41) for the formation of phenol from oxidation of benzene (the center dot OH probe used), but a value of about 10 kJ mol(-1) for p-benzoquinone loss, which is consistent with formation of a quinone-water exciplex. These data provide insight into DOM photochemistry as well as provide parameters useful for modeling steady state center dot OH concentrations in natural systems.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 7	2015	49	7					4147	4154		10.1021/acs.est.5b00102						WOS:000352659000019	25719947

This work investigated the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the motility, attachment, and transport of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida G7 in saturated porous media. The study is based on the hypothesis that DOM quality is critical to triggering tactic motility and, consequently, affects bacterial transport and dispersal. Sunflower root exudates, humic acids (HA), and the synthetic oleophilic fertilizer S-200 were used as representatives of fresh, weathered, and artificially processed DOM with high nitrogen and phosphorus contents, respectively. We studied DOM levels of 16-130 mg L-1, which are representative of DOM concentrations typically found in agricultural soil pore water. In contrast to its responses to HA and S-200, strain G7 exhibited a tactic behavior toward root exudates, as quantified by chemotaxis assays and single-cell motility observations. All DOM types promoted bacterial transport through sand at high concentrations (similar to 130 mg L-1). At low DOM concentrations (similar to 16 mg L-1), the enhancement occurred only in the presence of sunflower root exudates, and this enhancement did not occur with G7 bacteria devoid of flagella. Our results suggest that tactic DOM effectors strongly influence bacterial transport and the interception probability of motile bacteria by collector surfaces.

Variations in the concentrations of dissolved REEs and several elements (As, Sb, and V) apparently correlated well with peak intensities in the optical spectra (ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence emission) of the river water. The optical properties were considered to represent humic substances in dissolved organic matter (DOM). Similar hysteretic loops were found for the REE concentrations and optical intensities as a function of the water discharge. This result indicates that the mobile REEs and DOM likely shared flow paths from the soil to the stream during these events. An ultrafiltration study revealed that colloidal REEs present in a size fraction of 10-30 kilodaltons comprised the major component of the dissolved REEs and increased under high water flow. Considering these observations and model interpretations in the precedent literature, complexation of the dissolved REEs with DOM was suggested to occur during the studied rainfall events. A high correlation between the size-fractionated REE concentrations and specific ultraviolet absorbance was observed, suggesting that the aromaticity of DOM plays a role in its complexation with dissolved REEs.

The data used in this paper include the spectral data (R-rs(lambda)) collected on October 26, 2013 over Guanting Reservoir and a(CDOM)(lambda) measured in the laboratory. A semi-analytical method (QAA-CDOM) was validated and improved accordingly. The inversion result accuracy of QAA-CDOM was not bad, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.10 and the mean relative error (sigma) was 10.8%. The QAA-CDOM method was improved by recalculating the value of Q (the ratio of upwelling irradiance to upwelling radiance just below the water surface) by the field spectral data to replace the fixed value. After this improvement, the inversion accuracy was slightly improved, with RMSE of 0.09 and of 10.2%. After that, four band ratios were used in linear regression with a(CDOM) (440) to build empirical inversion models. The results showed that the performance of the model based on R-rs(531)/R-rs(551) was the best, with R-2 of 0.63. The RMSE and sigma of the a(CDOM) (440) result inverted by the empirical method were 0.08 and 8.8% respectively. The empirical method was of higher precision than that of the semi-analytical method, but the bands and coefficients used in the empirical method need to be calibrated by concurrently measured data in each study area. On the contrary, semi-analytical method does not need calibration, and is easier to be applied.																	1000-0593					APR	2015	35	4					1015	1019		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)04-1015-05						WOS:000352926900030		
J	He, R; Tian, BH; Zhang, QQ; Zhang, HT				He, Ruo; Tian, Bao-Hu; Zhang, Qi-Qi; Zhang, Hong-Tao			Effect of Fenton oxidation on biodegradability, biotoxicity and dissolved organic matter distribution of concentrated landfill leachate derived from a membrane process	WASTE MANAGEMENT												The treatment of concentrated landfill leachate from membrane process is a troublesome issue due to high concentrations of biorecalcitrant pollutants. In this study, the effect of Fenton process on dissolved organic matter (DOM) distribution (i.e. humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA) and hydrophilic fraction (HyI)), chemical forms of toxic organic compounds and metals, and their biotoxicity were investigated. In the concentrated leachate, toluene, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene predominated in the HyI fraction, while phthalate esters (PAEs) were mainly absorbed on the HA and FA fractions. PAEs were more readily removed from the HA and FA fractions than that from the HyI fraction in the Fenton process. The complexing abilities of DOM varied with types of metal in the concentrated leachate. The biotoxicities of the DOM fractions to luminescent bacteria (Photobacterium phosphoreum T3 mutation) were HA > FA > HyI. The biotoxicities of the hydrophobic organic contaminants to luminescent bacteria were not obvious in the concentrated leachate due to their low concentrations. Metals might be the main contributor to the biotoxicity to luminous bacteria in the concentrated leachate. These results indicated that Fenton process could influence the pollutants distribution in DOM and their biotoxicities through the breakdown of HA and FA in the concentrated leachate.

Dissolved organic matter features, pH, and Fe content in the main stream and tributaries of the forested Wustebach catchment in Germany were examined for a 4-yr weekly sampling period (2009-2013). The catchment outlet (Wu14) discharge (Q) ranged from 0.22 to 72.5 L s(-1), with minima and maxima around the summer and winter seasons, respectively. Discharge clearly followed precipitation in the late autumn to early spring period. Dissolved organic C (DOC) values at Wu14 ranged between 0.8 and 7.4 mg L-1, with a mean of 2.7 mg L-1. Annual periodicities in DOC and temperature (T), and DOC and Fe concentrations were positively correlated, reflecting DOM transport via organo-mineral complexes. The watershed tributaries dominated by surficial water (Wu01, Wu08, and Wu09) exhibited relatively high DOC, Fe, pH, and specific DOC UV absorbance (SUVA) and high variability. Groundwater-dominated tributaries (Wu03, Wu12, and Wu15) had lower, less variable contents. The extremely dry 2011 spring had limited effect on stream water chemistry. Outlet (Wu14) stream water DOC reflected seasonally variable contributions of surficial water and groundwater, annually 65 vs. 35%. Critically, a 4-yr lowering of SUVA (reduction of the DOM aromaticity and increased biodegradability) was observed in headwater tributaries (Wu01 and Wu08) but not at Wu14. Our long-term spatial-temporal explicit data set, covering both tributaries and main stream water DOM quality and quantity, was critical in apportionment of contributing sources and drivers of sub-and whole-catchment stream water DOM dynamics.					bol, roland/0000-0003-3015-7706; Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808												1539-1663					APR	2015	14	4								10.2136/vzj2015.01.0005						WOS:000352872100004

This increase has reduced the quality of the aquatic environment. In this study, UV-vis spectroscopy and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy with a difference of 50 nm between the excitation and emission (SF50) were used to characterize the DOC in a rural river (Madon River). The specific absorbance index at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) which is related to the aromaticity of DOC was extracted from UV-vis spectra, whose maximum of the second derivative (occurring near 225 nm) is related to nitrates. SF50 spectra which are characterized by well-defined peaks indicated large spatial and temporal variations. Two methods were used to analyze and compare these spectra. The first method was based on the decomposition of the SF50 spectra into four Gauss functions: B1 (related to tryptophan-like fluorescence), B2 and B3 (related to humic substances), and B4 (related to chlorophyll-like substances). The second method was principal components analysis (PCA), which results yielded three principal components that accounted for 95 % of the variance. Although PCA enables the consideration of the spectra without making assumptions regarding the number of fluorophores, the results from the decomposition in Gauss function were easier to interpret.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2015	187	4							188	10.1007/s10661-015-4422-9						WOS:000352113200014	25784610

We combined intensive sampling with liquid chromatography and spectroscopic techniques to follow changes in DOC and DON concentrations as well as in DOM size fractions and spectroscopic properties in a temporary stream during an entire contraction-fragmentation-expansion hydrological cycle. DOC and DON concentrations remained low (range = 1.4-5.2 mg C L-1 and 0.05-0.15 mg N L-1) during hydrological contraction and fragmentation, with concomitant increases in the proportion of high molecular weight substances (HMWS) during contraction and of DOM aromaticity during fragmentation. DOC and DON concentrations abruptly increased (up to 8.8 mg C L-1 and 0.37 mg N L-1) at the end of the fragmentation phase, with a concomitant increase in the non-humic, microbial and aquatic character of DOM. Upon rewetting, the DOC and DON concentrations reached their highest values (up to 12.7 mg C L-1 and 0.39 mg N L-1), with concomitant increases in the proportion of HMWS and in the humic, aromatic and terrestrial character of DOM. Subsequently, DOC and DON concentrations recovered to values similar to those at the contraction phase, while DOM composition variables indicated the prevalence of a DOM of humic and terrestrial character during the whole expansion phase. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of hydrological transitions for DOM dynamics in temporary streams, and point to the potential response of perennial streams under future water scarcity scenarios.

Ecosystem Consequences of Changing Inputs of Terrestrial Dissolved Organic Matter to Lakes: Current Knowledge and Future Challenges	ECOSYSTEMS												Lake ecosystems and the services that they provide to people are profoundly influenced by dissolved organic matter derived from terrestrial plant tissues. These terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) inputs to lakes have changed substantially in recent decades, and will likely continue to change. In this paper, we first briefly review the substantial literature describing tDOM effects on lakes and ongoing changes in tDOM inputs. We then identify and provide examples of four major challenges which limit predictions about the implications of tDOM change for lakes, as follows: First, it is currently difficult to forecast future tDOM inputs for particular lakes or lake regions. Second, tDOM influences ecosystems via complex, interacting, physical-chemical-biological effects and our holistic understanding of those effects is still rudimentary. Third, non-linearities and thresholds in relationships between tDOM inputs and ecosystem processes have not been well described. Fourth, much understanding of tDOM effects is built on comparative studies across space that may not capture likely responses through time. We conclude by identifying research approaches that may be important for overcoming those challenges in order to provide policy- and management-relevant predictions about the implications of changing tDOM inputs for lakes.

The complexation and strength of binding of Ag+ with DOM in soil water extracts was examined and modelled based on a range of chemical and quality DOM measurements. Silver ion binding measured by addition of the Ag-110m radioisotope in addition to a cation exchange resin technique were used to determine strongly complexed Ag in solutions. Silver was found to be up to 70% strongly complexed. The variability in Ag+ binding by DOM across different soils was closely related (R-2 = 0.8) to the mid-infrared spectra of these extracts. The affinity of Ag+ for DOM was stronger in solutions containing a greater content of humic and aromatic structures. The ability of Ag+ to complex with DOM could result in increased mobilisation of this metal in the soil environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of several abiotic parameters, including solution pH, initial TCC concentration, presence of natural organic matter, and most common inorganic anions in surface waters, were investigated. The results show that the photolysis of TCC followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The TCC photolysis rate constant increased with increasing solution pH and decreasing the initial TCC concentration. Compared with the TCC photolysis in pure water, the presence of aqueous bicarbonate, nitrate, humic acids, and its sodium salt decreased the TCC photolysis rate, but fulvic acid increased the TCC photolysis rate. The electron spin resonance and reactive oxygen species scavenging experiments indicated that TCC may undergo two different types of phototransformation reactions: direct photolysis and energy transfer to generate O-1(2). The main degradation products were tentatively identified by gas chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and a possible degradation pathway was also proposed.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2015	22	7					5204	5211		10.1007/s11356-014-3686-x						WOS:000351586500037	25354431

Soil columns were leached with simulated acid rain (SAR) at pH ranging from 2.5 to 5.6. The impact of SAR on the release of phenanthrene from red soil and its correlation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in eluates were investigated. The results showed that the leaching loss of phenanthrene was affected by both the leaching volume and acidity of SAR. When the leaching volume was less than 500 mm, the phenanthrene concentration in eluates decreased rapidly with increasing leaching volume, indicating a high rate of leaching loss at the beginning of leaching; then with continuous leaching, the phenanthrene concentration decreased slightly and reached zero when the leaching volume reached 875 mm. The lower pH of SAR was, the higher release rate of phenanthrene was. The change of DOC in eluates was similar to that of the phenanthrene concentration. The phenanthrene concentration had a significantly positive correlation with DOC in all eluates (the squared correlation coefficient R (2) varied between 0.952 and 0.997). Three-dimensional fluorescence analysis revealed that phenanthrene was associated with humic acid and fulvic acid, and was released with dissolved organic matters leached by SAR.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2015	73	7					3675	3681		10.1007/s12665-014-3653-3						WOS:000351163300051

However, details of several mechanisms of the coupled photochemical and biological processing of DOM remain too poorly understood to achieve accurate predictions of the impact of these processes on DOM fate and reactivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate how photochemical degradation of amino acids affects bacterial metabolism and whether or not photochemical degradation of DOM competes for amino acids with biological processes. We examined the interactions between photochemical and bacterial degradation dynamics using a mixture of 18 amino acids and examined their dynamics and turnover rates within a larger pool of allochthonous or autochthonous DOM. We observed that photochemical exposure of DOM containing amino acids led to delayed biomass production (even though the final biomass did not differ), most likely due to a need for upregulation of biosynthetic pathways for amino acids that were damaged by photochemically produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). This response was most pronounced in bacterial communities where the abundance of photosensitive amino acids was highest (amended treatments and autochthonous DOM) and least pronounced when the abundance of these amino acids was low (unamended and allochthonous DOM), likely because these bacteria already had these biosynthetic pathways functioning. We observed both a cost and benefit associated with photochemical exposure of DOM. We observed a cost associated with photochemically produced ROS that partially degrade key amino acids and a benefit associated with an increase in the availability of other compounds in the DOM. Bacteria growing on DOM sources that are low in labile amino acids, such as those in terrestrially influenced environments, experience more of the benefits associated with photochemical exposure, whereas bacteria growing in more amino acid-rich environments, such as eutrophic and less terrestrially influenced waters, experience a higher cost due to the increased necessity of salvage pathways for these essential amino acids. Finally, we propose a conceptual model whereby the effects of DOM photochemical degradation on microbial metabolism result from the balance between two mechanisms: One is dependent on the DOM sources, and the other is dependent on the DOM concentration in natural systems.

Effect of dissolved organic matter composition on metal speciation in soil solutions	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Knowledge of the speciation of heavy metals and the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil solution is a key to understand metal mobility and ecotoxicity. In this study, soil column-Donnan membrane technique (SC-DMT) was used to measure metal speciation of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in eighteen soil solutions, covering a wide range of metal sources and concentrations. DOM in these soil solutions was also fractionated into humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), hydrophilic acid (Hy), and hydrophobic neutral organic matter (HON) by a rapid batch technique using DAX-8 resin. Our results show that in soil solution Pb and Cu are dominant in complex form, whereas Cd, Ni and Zn mainly exist as free ions; for the whole range of soil solutions, only 26.2% of DOM is humic substances and consists mainly of fulvic acid (FA). The metal speciation measured by SC-DMT was compared to the predicted ones obtained via the NICA-Donnan model using the measured FA concentrations. The free ion concentrations predicted by speciation modeling were in good agreement with the SC-DMT measurement. Moreover, we show that to make accurate modeling of metal speciation in soil solutions, the knowledge of DOM composition, especially FA fraction, is the crucial information, especially for Cu and Cd; like in previous studies the modeling of Pb speciation is not optimal and an update of Pb generic binding parameters is required to reduce model prediction uncertainties.

J	Roth, VN; Dittmar, T; Gaupp, R; Gleixner, G				Roth, Vanessa-Nina; Dittmar, Thorsten; Gaupp, Reinhard; Gleixner, Gerd			The Molecular Composition of Dissolved Organic Matter in Forest Soils as a Function of pH and Temperature	PLOS ONE												We examined the molecular composition of forest soil water during three different seasons at three different sites, using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). We examined oxic soils and tested the hypothesis that pH and season correlate with the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We used molecular formulae and their relative intensity from ESI-FT-ICR-MS for statistical analysis. Applying unconstrained and constrained ordination methods, we observed that pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and season were the main factors correlating with DOM molecular composition. This result is consistent with a previous study where pH was a main driver of the molecular differences between DOM from oxic rivers and anoxic bog systems in the Yenisei River catchment. At a higher pH, the molecular formulae had a lower degree of unsaturation and oxygenation, lower molecular size and a higher abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds. These characteristics suggest a higher abundance of tannin connected to lower pH that possibly inhibited biological decomposition. Higher biological activity at a higher pH might also be related to the higher abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds. Comparing the seasons, we observed a decrease in unsaturation, molecular diversity and the number of nitrogen-containing compounds in the course of the year from March to November. Temperature possibly inhibited biological degradation during winter, which could cause the accumulation of a more diverse compound spectrum until the temperature increased again. Our findings suggest that the molecular composition of DOM in soil pore waters is dynamic and a function of ecosystem activity, pH and temperature.

Dissolved Organic Matter Composition Drives the Marine Production of Brominated Very Short-Lived Substances	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Brominated very short-lived substances,(BrVSLS), such as bromoform; are important trace gases for stratospheric ozone chemistry. These naturally derived trace gages are formed via bromoperoxidase-mediated halogenation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater. Information on DOM type in relation to the observed BrVSLS concentrations in seawater, however, is scarce. We examined the sensitivity of BrVSLS production in relation to the presence of specific DOM moieties. A total Of 28 model DOM compounds in artificial seawater were treated with vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO): Our results show a clear dependence of BrVSLS production on DOM type. In general, molecules that comprise a large fraction of the bulk DOM pool did not noticeably affect BrVSLS production: Only specific cell metabolites and humic acid appeared to significantly,enhance BrVSLS production. Albino acids and lignin phenols suppressed enzyme-mediated BrVSLS production and may instead have formed halogenated nonvolatile molecules. Dibromomethane production was not observed in any experiments, suggesting it is not produced by the same pathway as the other BrVSLS. Our results suggest that regional differences in DOM composition may explain the observed BrVSLS concentration variability in the global ocean: Ultimately, BrVSLS production and concentrations are likely affected by DOM composition, reactivity, and cycling in the ocean.

Sampling was performed over a 4-year period (2008-2011) for five locations with drainage areas of 0.62, 3.5, 4.5, 12 and 79ha. Hydrologic flow paths were characterized using an end-member mixing model. DOM composition was determined using a suite of spectrofluorometric indices and a site-specific parallel factor analysis model. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), humic-like DOM and fluorescence index were most sensitive to changes with drainage scale, whereas dissolved organic nitrogen, specific UV absorbance, Sr and protein-like DOM were least sensitive. DOM concentrations and humic-like DOM constituents were highest during both baseflow and stormflow for a 3.5-ha catchment with a wetland near the catchment outlet. Whereas storm-event concentrations of DOC and humic DOM constituents declined, the mass exports of DOC increased with increasing catchment scale. A pronounced dilution in storm-event DOC concentration was observed at peak stream discharge for the 12-ha drainage location, which was not as apparent at the 79-ha scale, suggesting key differences in supply and transport of DOM. Our observations indicate that hydrologic flow paths, especially during storms, and the location and extent of wetlands in the catchment are key determinants of DOM concentration and composition. This study furthers our understanding of changes in DOM with drainage scale and the controls on DOM in headwater, forested catchments.

Product ion spectra of selected precursor ions (m/z 359-375) have been acquired to obtain structural information, after method development. To evaluate the performance of the method, the Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) reference standard was also analyzed. By reconstructing the individual product ion spectrum of marine DOM, several fragments were assigned to the different precursor ions indicating the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl, lactones, quinones, esters, and structures more similar to lignin-degraded molecules. On the basis of these findings, coastal marine DOM molecules, although structurally homogeneous, might be more rich in diversity of functional groups than previously described.																	1618-2642	1618-2650				MAR	2015	407	9					2455	2462		10.1007/s00216-015-8499-3						WOS:000351510300012	25701414

Samples from different textile wastewater treatment plants were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography and size exclusion chromatography as well as fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra. Despite the highly heterogeneous textile effluents, the fluorescent components and their physicochemical properties were found relatively invariable, which is beneficial for the combination of biological and physicochemical treatment processes. The humic-like substance with triple-excitation peaks (excitation (Ex) 250, 310, 365/emission (Em) 460 nm) presented as the specific fluorescence indicator in textile effluents. It was also the major contributor to UV absorbance at 254 nm and resulted in the brown color of biologically treated textile effluents. By spectral comparison, the specific fluorophore in textile effluents could be attributed to the intermediate structure of azo dyes 1-amino-2-naphthol, which was transferred into the special humic-like substances during biological treatment.

After optimization of the SPME method for the analysis of TFR, partition coefficients (K-DOM) with three different sources of DOM were determined in buffered solutions at pH 7. Commercial humic acids and DOM fractions isolated from two surface waters were used. The values of log K-DOM varied from 4.3 to 5.8, depending on the nature of the organic material. A good correlation was established between log K-DOM and DOM properties (as measured with the H/O atomic ratio and UV absorbance), in agreement with literature data. This is consistent with the effect of polarity and aromaticity for governing DOM-pollutant associations, regardless of the origin of DOM. This association phenomenon is relevant to better understand the behavior of pesticides in the environment since it controls part of pesticide leaching and fate in aquatic systems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2015	22	6					4201	4212		10.1007/s11356-014-3614-0						WOS:000350572500016	25277710

Diel cycles in the fluorescence of dissolved organic matter in dystrophic Wisconsin seepage lakes: Implications for carbon turnover	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We monitored the dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence in two Wisconsin bog lakes over timescales ranging from hours to months. Peatland-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) was the major solute in both bog lakes, and diel cycles were dominant features of the CDOM fluorescence time series. Two distinct diel cycles that differed in amplitude and timing were observed: one in oxic epilimnia and a second in anoxic, hypolimnetic waters. These cycles were not attributable to instrumental artifacts (i.e., daily oscillations of temperature, ambient light, or battery voltage), hydrologic forcing, or the effects of inner filtering, pH, or redox conditions. High light extinction coefficients, especially in the ultraviolet region (approximate to 10 m(-1) to 30 m(-1)), suggest that DOM photolysis was negligible at the depths of the CDOM fluorescence probes in these dark-water lakes (dissolved carbon concentration: 10 mg C L-1 to 20 mg C L-1). The diel cycles were apparently governed primarily by biological activities that mediate DOM production (release) and destruction (uptake). Rates of carbon turnover derived from properties of the epilimnetic CDOM fluorescence cycle (0.28 mg C L-1 d(-1)) were similar to rates of net ecosystem production based on daily CO2 dynamics (0.32 mg C L-1 d(-1)). It appears that a small, secondary pool of labile organic carbon turns over at relatively high rates in these bog lakes, consistent with the two-compartment view of DOM stability.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2015	60	2					482	496		10.1002/lno.10026						WOS:000351126500011

Origin-specific molecular signatures of dissolved organic matter in the Lena Delta	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Large Arctic rivers discharge significant amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the Arctic Ocean. We sampled natural waters of the Lena River, the Buor-Khaya Bay (Laptev Sea), permafrost melt water creeks, ice complex melt water creeks and a lake. The goal of this study was to characterize the molecular DOM composition with respect to different water bodies within the Lena Delta. We aimed at an identification of source-specific DOM molecular markers and their relative contribution to DOM of different origin. The molecular characterization was performed for solid-phase extracted DOM by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Average dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the original samples were 490 +/- A 75 A mu mol C L-1 for riverine and bay samples and 399 +/- A 115 A mu mol C L-1 for permafrost melt water creeks. Average TDN concentrations were elevated in the permafrost melt waters (19.7 +/- A 7.1 A mu mol N L-1) in comparison to the river and the bay (both 13.2 +/- A 2.6 A mu mol N L-1). FT-ICR MS and statistical tools demonstrated that the origin of DOM in the Lena Delta was systematically reflected in its molecular composition. Magnitude weighted parameters calculated from MS data (O/C-wa, H/C-wa, C/N-wa) highlighted preliminary sample discrimination. The highest H/C-wa of 1.315 was found for DOM in melt water creeks in comparison to 1.281 for river and 1.230 for the bay samples. In the bay samples we observed a higher fraction of oxygen-rich components which was reflected in an O/C-wa ratio of 0.445 in comparison to 0.425 and 0.427 in the river and creeks, respectively. From the southernmost location to the bay a relative depletion of nitrogenous molecular markers and an enrichment of oxidized DOM components occurred. The highest contribution of nitrogenous components was indicative for creeks reflected in a C/N-wa of 104 in comparison to 143 and 176 in the river and bay, respectively. These observations were studied on a molecular formula level using principal component and indicator value analyses. The results showed systematic differences with respect to water origin and constitute an important basis for a better mechanistic understanding of DOM transformations in the changing Arctic rivers.

Impact of drying/rewetting cycles on the bioavailability of dissolved organic matter molecular-weight fractions in a Mediterranean stream	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Mediterranean fluvial systems are subject to severe drought/rewetting cycles. These extreme periods modify the direction and magnitude of the water fluxes between the stream surface water and the riparian ground water, enabling exploration of the abrupt changes affecting dissolved organic matter (DOM). We investigated the variability in DOM concentration and composition over a drying and rewetting period in a stream-riparian groundwater system. We analyzed dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON), and bioavailable DOC (BDOC) in whole water and 3 molecular-weight (MW) fractions (high [HMW]: >10 KDa, medium: 1-10 KDa, low [LMW]: <1 KDa) in surface water and riparian ground water. The quantitative differences in DOM between surface water and riparian ground water were minimal during the drying period, but were greater during the rewetting period because of notable flushing of DOC (>6 mg/L) and DON (>0.4 mg/L) in stream water. Asynchronous inputs of DOC and DON were detected in stream water during rewetting: an abrupt and brief increase (up to 32%) in DOCHMW contribution, and a strong and persistent increase (up to 70%) in DONLMW contribution. Average BDOC values were 18% in stream water and 13% in riparian ground water. BDOC was not correlated with DOC MW, but was positively correlated with DON (r = 0.59, df = 17, p < 0.01). During rewetting, BDOC increased by up to 49%, DONLMW input occurred, and the DOCLMW:DONLMW ratio decreased to values <15:1, suggesting that small, nitrogenous organic compounds contributed to DOM bioavailability. The rewetting period occurred in the brief span of only 2 wk, but it had major biogeochemical implications for DOM and generated a pulse of potentially bioavailable DOM to the stream-riparian interface and downstream communities.

Watershed hydrology and dissolved organic matter export across time scales: minute to millennium	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Ecological theory emphasizes headwater streams and wetlands as hotspots for metabolism of terrestrially derived organic matter and biogeochemical transformations. Growing evidence indicates that freshwater ecosystems may be as important as terrestrial and marine environments in the annual flux of CO2 to the atmosphere. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Stream Ecological Observatory Network (STREON) offer the opportunity to collect and analyze data related to these processes at spatial scales ranging from local to continental and at temporal scales from minutes to millennia. These data can be used to understand how global climate change and subsequent shifts in terrestrial plant communities and precipitation regimes will influence the export and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to headwater streams, downstream freshwater ecosystems, and coastal environments. Moreover, temporal scaling of DOM export among watersheds is an underexploited frontier research area throughout the earth sciences. Long-term, high-frequency fluorometry and discharge data sets collected at NEON and STREON observatories could be linked to evaluate, quantify, and forecast DOM export among watersheds and across time scales ranging from individual hydrologic events to decadal changes in precipitation regimes.

Evaluation and modelling of dissolved organic matter reactivity toward As-III and As-V - Implication in environmental arsenic speciation	TALANTA												Many studies have been carried out to identify dissolved organic matter-trace metals interactions, as organic matter (OM) was demonstrated to be a governing parameter of metals speciation. Concerning arsenic (As), such OM-As studies are scarce and concluded that, when As binding occurred, it was probably through cationic bridges or, in some cases, directly. Yet, analytical proofs remained complex to obtain. In this work, As binding with Suwanee River Humic Acid (SRHA), as an example of dissolved organic matter, was studied, considering both As-III and As-V, at various pH and in absence/presence of Na and Ca. Dialysis, fluorescence measurements and PHREEQC modelling were performed to identify and characterize the mechanisms at work for the various performed experiments. It was observed that As-III binding on SRHA occurred through direct SRHA-As-III binding and that neither Na nor Ca presence modify this mechanism. As-III appeared to be also bound by SRHA through direct interaction, but suffered from the competition of Na for the SRHA binding sites. Oppositely, in presence of Ca, the overall As-V-SRHA binding was significantly enhanced, Ca acting as an efficient cationic bridge through the formation of an SRHA-Ca-As-V ternary complex. All the obtained data were satisfactorily simulated using a unique set of binding parameters which can therefore be implemented in any speciation code to better address As behaviour in environmental conditions.

The variation in the composition of WSOM in the different sewage sludge samples could be correlated with the conditions of stabilization; therefore, the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor these changes can be a useful tool to optimize the management of this residual flux, avoiding environmental pollution. However, the "contour density" EEM maps obtained with fluorescence present continuous spectra with different peaks, valleys, and shoulders where manual peak picking can be complicated and subjective, especially in complex matrixes such as sewage sludge. With the PARAFAC algorithm, it is possible to resolve the emission and excitation spectra of the different fluorescence components present in the samples and their contribution to the total fluorescence. Also, the contribution (scores) of the different fluorophors can be coupled with another chemometric tool to provide an effective classification method using the stabilization conditions of sewage sludge as main criterion. In this study, a wide survey of sewage sludge samples (287) was characterized by fluorescence emission-excitation matrix. The final molecular composition of the sewage sludge samples was not related to the stabilization (aerobic vs anaerobic) treatments. However, a sewage sludge classification based on a combined spectroscopic-chemometric approach was obtained, which could be used for the optimization of sewage sludge use in agriculture, minimizing the environmental risks.

As carbon emissions continue unabated, two major stressors-warming and acidification-threaten marine systems on several scales. Here, we report that a moderate temperature increase (from 30 degrees C to 32 degrees C) is sufficient to slow-even hinder-the ability of dissolved organic matter, a major carbon pool, to self-assemble to form marine microgels, which contribute to the particulate organic matter pool. Moreover, acidification lowers the temperature threshold at which we observe our results. These findings carry implications for the marine carbon cycle, as self-assembled marine microgels generate an estimated global seawater budget of similar to 10(16) g C. We used laser scattering spectroscopy to test the influence of temperature and pH on spontaneous marine gel assembly. The results of independent experiments revealed that at a particular point, both pH and temperature block microgel formation (32 degrees C, pH 8.2), and disperse existing gels (35 degrees C). We then tested the hypothesis that temperature and pH have a synergistic influence on marine gel dispersion. We found that the dispersion temperature decreases concurrently with pH: from 32 degrees C at pH 8.2, to 28 degrees C at pH 7.5. If our laboratory observations can be extrapolated to complex marine environments, our results suggest that a warming-acidification synergism can decrease carbon and nutrient fluxes, disturbing marine trophic and trace element cycles, at rates faster than projected.

J	Kim, J; Kim, G				Kim, Jeonghyun; Kim, Guebuem			Importance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) inputs from the deep sea to the euphotic zone: Results from the East (Japan) Sea	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The vertical and horizontal distributions of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the East (Japan) Sea of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean were determined by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The PARAFAC model identified two humic-like components and one protein-like component in the study region. The concentration of the protein-like component decreased, whereas that of the humic-like components increased with depth. Significant correlations between the fluorescence intensity of the humic-like CDOM and the apparent oxygen utilization below the thermocline indicate that the humic-like CDOM originates primarily from the in situ biological activity. In addition, the negative relationship observed between the salinity and fluorescence intensity of CDOM in the surface water of the study region, including the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, southern sea of Korea, and East Sea, suggests that CDOM in the "freshwater" fraction of the study region originated predominantly from the Changjiang River. The box model results show that the proportions of the humic-like CDOM transported from the subsurface layer were approximately 33% for C1 and 22% for C3 of the riverine sources. The results of this study highlight the significance of CDOM inputs from the subsurface layer as an unrecognized source of CDOM in the euphoric zone, which may have a significant influence on the biology and biogeochemistry of the ocean.

The relevant aspects of metalorganic interactions remain unclear because the metal binding functionalities in DOM are substantially nonuniform and the availability of the models is limited. In this work, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) integrated with synchronous fluorescence and infrared absorption spectroscopy was used to explore the binding process of copper to DOM. A series of heterogeneous binding sites in humic acid (HA), a representative DOM, and the subsequent subtle changes of these sites within the molecular interactions were elucidated by the 2DCOS method. The band assignments and the correspondence between the results obtained by two spectral probes (synchronous fluorescence and infrared absorption spectra) were verified by hetero-2DCOS. Our results showed that, during the copper binding process, the carboxyl and polysaccharide groups gave the fastest responses to copper binding. Then fluorescence quenching of fluorescent humic-like moieties occurred with a vibrational change of the related functionalities, i.e., phenolic and aryl carboxylic groups, which further induces the fluorescence quenching of fulvic-like fractions. Finally, small amounts of amide and aliphatic groups participated in the copper binding after the fluorescence of the protein-like fraction decreased. With these promising results, a comprehensive picture of structural changes of HA during the copper binding process was developed, highlighting the superior potential of 2D heterospectral correlation spectroscopy in studying complex interactions in the environment.

Changing hydrological connectivity of the floodplain generates a broad range of conditions, from lentic to lotic. This creates a mixture of allochthonously and autochthonously derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). Autochthonous DOM, including photosynthetic extracellular release (PER), is an important source supporting bacterial secondary production (BSP). Nonetheless, no details are available regarding microbial extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) as a response to PER under variable hydrological settings in river-floodplain systems. To investigate the relationship between bacterial and phytoplankton components, we therefore used EEA as a tool to track the microbial response to non-chromophoric, but reactive and ecologically important DOM. The study was conducted in three floodplain subsystems with distinct hydrological regimes (Danube Floodplain National Park, Austria). The focus was on the post-flood period. Enhanced %PER (up to 48% of primary production) in a hydrologically isolated subsystem was strongly correlated with beta-glucosidase, which was related to BSP. This shows that in disconnected floodplain backwaters with high terrestrial input BSP can also be driven by autochthonous carbon sources (PER). In a semi-isolated section, in the presence of fresh labile material from primary producers, enhanced activity of phenol oxidase was observed. In frequently flooded river-floodplain systems, BSP was mainly driven by enzymatic degradation of particulate primary production. Our research demonstrates that EEA measurements are an excellent tool to describe the coupling between bacteria and phytoplankton, which cannot be deciphered when focusing solely on chromophoric DOM.

Dissolved organic matter composition and photochemical transformations in the northern North Pacific Ocean	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The composition and photochemical transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the northern North Pacific Ocean were investigated at the molecular level using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and geochemical tracers. Analyses included vertical profiles and experiments in which deep sea DOM was exposed to sunlight and incubated in the dark. The composition of the deep sea DOM was found to be approximately uniform and enriched with highly unsaturated compounds, with highly aromatic compounds, and with polycyclic aromatics. Surface DOM had a significantly different composition, being enriched with both highly unsaturated and with unsaturated aliphatic compounds potentially due to the addition of photodegradation products and phytoplankton inputs. Deep sea DOM composition is transformed by photoreactions, becoming more similar to surface DOM. The influence of photochemistry extends beyond the photic zone, presumably because of vertical export of DOM previously modified at the surface.

Quality of dissolved organic matter affects planktonic but not biofilm bacterial production in streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Streams and rivers are important sites of organic carbon mineralization which is dependent on the land use within river catchments. Here we tested whether planktonic and epilithic biofilm bacteria differ in their response to the quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Thus, planlctonic and biofilm bacterial production was compared with patterns of DOC along a land-use gradient in the Bode catchment area (Germany). The freshness index of DOC was positively related to the proportion of agricultural area in the catchment. The humification index correlated with the proportion of forest area. Abundance and production of planktonic bacteria were lower in headwaters than at downstream sites. Planktonic production was weakly correlated to the total concentration of DOC but more strongly to quality-measures as revealed by spectra indexes, i.e. positively to the freshness index and negatively to the humification index. In contrast to planktonic bacteria, abundance and production of biofilm bacteria were independent of DOC quality. This finding may be explained by the association of biofilm bacteria with benthic algae and an extracellular matrix which represent additional substrate sources. The data show that planktonic bacteria seem to be regulated at a landscape scale controlled by land use, whereas biofilm bacteria are regulated at a biofilm matrix scale controlled by autochthonous production. Thus, the effects of catchment-scale land use changes on ecosystem processes are likely lower in small streams dominated by biofilm bacteria than in larger streams dominated by planktonic bacteria.

An approach to estimate the freshwater contribution from glacial melt and precipitation in East Greenland shelf waters using colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Changes in the supply and storage of freshwater in the Arctic Ocean and its subsequent export to the North Atlantic can potentially influence ocean circulation and climate. In order to understand how the Arctic freshwater budget is changing and the potential impacts, it is important to develop and refine empirical approaches for tracing freshwater contributions. This in turn can help develop and validate model simulations. Arctic rivers are an important source of freshwater and stable oxygen isotope measurements are used to separate contributions from meteoric water (river, glacial, and precipitation) and sea ice melt. We develop this approach further and investigate the use of an additional tracer, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which is largely specific to freshwater originating from Arctic rivers. A robust relationship between the freshwater contribution from meteoric water and CDOM is derived from 4 years of measurements in Fram Strait (2009-2012), combined with measurements from the East Greenland shelf and Dijmpha Sound (NE Greenland). Results confirm a high contribution of riverine CDOM in Arctic halocline waters with salinities >31.5 and indicate the importance of shelf processes (riverine input and sea ice formation), while previously, these waters where thought to be derived from open sea processes (cooling and sea ice formation) in the northern Barents and Kara Seas. In Greenlandic coastal waters the meteoric water contribution is influenced by Greenland ice sheet meltwater and deviations from the CDOM-meteoric water relationships found are applied to quantify meltwater contribution along the East Greenland shelf waters (0-13%).

J	Engel, M; Chefetz, B				Engel, Maya; Chefetz, Benny			Adsorptive fractionation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by carbon nanotubes	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and carbon nanotubes are introduced into aquatic environments. Thus, it is important to elucidate whether their interaction affects DOM amount and composition. In this study, the composition of DOM, before and after interactions with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), was measured and the adsorption affinity of the individual structural fractions of DOM to SWCNTs was investigated. Adsorption of DOM to SWCNTs was dominated by the hydrophobic acid fraction, resulting in relative enhancement of the hydrophilic character of non-adsorbed DOM. The preferential adsorption of the HoA fraction was concentration-dependent, increasing with increasing concentration. Adsorption affinities of bulk DOM calculated as the normalized sum of affinities of the individual structural fractions were similar to the measured affinities, suggesting that the structural fractions of DOM act as independent adsorbates. The altered DOM composition may affect the nature and reactivity of DOM in aquatic environments polluted with carbon nanotubes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), the absorption spectra of CDOM and the fluorescence intensity of proteins (Ex/Em 280/320 nm; F(280/320)) and marine humic-like substances (F(320/410)) were measured in the upper 200 m. DOC and DON showed higher concentrations in the top 20 m than below, and DOC increased southwards, while DON decreased. F(280/320) and F(320/410) showed maxima near the deep chlorophyll maximum (at about 50 m), suggesting that these fluorophores were linked to phytoplankton production and the metabolism of the associated microbial community. The coloured and fluorescent fractions of DOM showed low levels south of the Azores Front, at about 35 degrees N, likely due to the accumulated photobleaching of the waters transported eastwards by the Azores current into the study area (at 20 degrees W). Twelve culture experiments were also conducted with surface water (5 m) to assess the impact of microbial degradation processes on the bulk, coloured and fluorescent fractions of DOM. After 72 h of incubation in the darkness, 14 +/- 9% (average +/- SD) of the initial DON was consumed at an average rate of 0.24 +/- 0.14 mu mol l(-1) d(-1) and the protein-like fluorescence decayed by 29 +/- 9% at a net rate of 0.06 +/- 0.03 QSU d(-1). These rates were significantly lower south of the Azores front, suggesting that DOM in this region was of a more recalcitrant nature. Conversely, the marine humic-like fluorescence increased at a net rate of 0.013 +/- 0.003 QSU d(-1). The close linear relationship of DON uptake with F(280/320) consumption (R-2= 0.91, p < 0.0001, n=12) and F(320/410) production (R-2= 0.52, p < 0.008, n=12) that we found during these incubation experiments suggest that the protein-like fluorescence can be used as a proxy for the dynamics of the labile DON pool and that marine humic-like materials can be produced as a by-product of microbial DOM degradation.

J	Wang, Y; Zhang, D; Shen, ZY; Feng, CH; Zhang, X				Wang, Ying; Zhang, Di; Shen, Zhen-yao; Feng, Cheng-hong; Zhang, Xiao			Investigation of the interaction between As and Sb species and dissolved organic matter in the Yangtze Estuary, China, using excitation-emission matrices with parallel factor analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The interactions between trivalent or pentavalent As/Sb and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in four regions (the river channel, the adjacent coastal area, and the northern and southern nearshore areas) of the Yangtze Estuary, China, were studied using fluorescence quenching titration combined with excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The As/Sb-DOM complexation characteristics were investigated using FTIR and UV absorbance spectroscopy and zeta potential analysis. Four protein-like components and one humic-like component were identified in the DOM from the Yangtze Estuary, China, by PARAFAC analysis. The tryptophan-like substance represented by component 2 was the dominant component and played an important role in the complexation between DOM and As/Sb. The results of complexation modeling demonstrated that the binding capacity of trivalent As/Sb with DOM was higher than that of pentavalent As/Sb with DOM. The DOM from the north nearshore area with the most acidic functional groups and greatest aromaticity possessed the highest binding capacity for trivalent and pentavalent As/Sb. The increase in the UV absorbance and the charge neutralization further indicated the interaction between As/Sb and DOM. The higher binding capacity of Sb(III) with DOM was mainly due to the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Our study demonstrates that the use of the advanced EEM-PARAFAC method in fluorescence quenching studies is very useful for evaluating the properties of DOM-pollutant interactions.

Hydrochemical results indicated that As concentration in groundwater ranged from 18.0 to 1821 mu g/L with an average value of 58.4 mu g/L. Dissolved Fe(II), sulfide and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were high in the elevated As groundwater. The As contents in both the bulk sediments and extractable fractions show an obvious positive correlation with the Fe contents, demonstrating that As is strongly associated with Fe-bearing minerals via adsorption and/or co-precipitation. The DOM in the shallow groundwater mainly contained terrestrially and microbially derived humic substances, and most of the quinone-like humic substances were in the oxidized state. By contrast, the DOM in the deep groundwater was predominantly microbially derived and had a higher concentration of labile DOM, and the quinone-like humic substances were more reduced. The strong linear correlation between DOC and HCO3- suggests that the high concentration of HCO3- may be related to the microbially mediated oxidation of DOM into HCO3- using Fe(III) or SO42- as electron acceptor in the anoxic groundwater. The relationships of As species with Fe(II), DOC concentrations, redox index and SUVA values of DOM indicate that abundant labile DOM may serve as an important electron donor to promote the microbially mediated reductions of Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides, SO42- and As(V). Furthermore, the quinone-like humic substances act as electron shuttles to transfer electrons from labile DOM to Fe(III), SO42-, and As(V) adsorbed on the surfaces of Fe minerals, hence enhancing the mobilization of As (particularly As(III)) into groundwater. However, the observed negative correlations of dissolved sulfide with As and Fe(II) concentrations in groundwater demonstrate that dissolved As is most likely scavenged via co-precipitation with Fe(II) sulfides or As-bearing sulfides. Therefore, reductive dissolution of Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides coupled to microbial oxidation of natural DOM may serve as the primary geochemical process controlling As mobilization in groundwater systems, while the formation of Fe(II) sulfides due to microbially mediated sulfate reduction and DOM oxidization could sequester As from groundwater.

Dissolved organic matter in the Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Several factors highlight the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in coastal ecosystems such as the Baltic Sea: 1) DOM is the main energy source for heterotrophic bacteria in surface waters, thus contributing to the productivity and trophic state of bodies of water. 2) DOM functions as a nutrient source: in the Baltic Sea, more than one-fourth of the bioavailable nutrients can occur in the dissolved organic form in riverine inputs and in surface water during summer. Thus, DOM also supports primary production, both directly (osmotrophy) and indirectly (via remineralization). 3) Flocculation and subsequent deposition of terrestrial DOM within river estuaries may contribute to production and oxygen consumption in coastal sediments. 4) Chromophoric DOM, which is one of the major absorbers of light entering the Baltic Sea, contributes highly to water color, thus affecting the photosynthetic depth as well as recreational value of the Baltic Sea. Despite its large-scale importance to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, DOM has been of minor interest compared with inorganic nutrient loadings. Information on the concentrations and dynamics of DOM in the Baltic Sea has accumulated since the late 1990s, but it is still sporadic. This review provides a coherent view of the current understanding of DOM dynamics in the Baltic Sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing the effects of dams and waterpower facilities on riverine dissolved organic matter composition	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An extensive study was performed in boreal rivers across northern Ontario Canada, to examine the responses of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in rivers altered by hydroelectric waterpower operations. This was tested through three study components: a control-impact component comparing differences upstream and downstream of waterpower facilities (WPFs); a longitudinal component examining responses downstream; and a temporal component comparing the diurnal variations between two disparate rivers. Parallel factor analysis was used to examine how the inherent characteristics of the DOM pool changed between rivers. All rivers were located in heavily forested watersheds with low-level human land use. The main factor differentiating rivers was the presence or absence of WPFs. In a few instances, we identified larger relative differences in the nutrients moving downstream of the WPFs and some diurnal variation between an altered and reference river. However, the overall outcome from each study component was that the presence of WPFs had very little influence on DOM. We related these results to riverine hydrology, as well as a potential relationship between DOM and temperature. In the boreal forest of northern Ontario, catchment characteristics may exert the strongest influence on DOM composition.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2015	744	1					145	164		10.1007/s10750-014-2069-0						WOS:000346182100011		
J	Janssen, EML; McNeill, K				Janssen, Elisabeth M. L.; McNeill, Kristopher			Environmental Photoinactivation of Extracellular Phosphatases and the Effects of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Alkaline phosphatases are ubiquitous extracellular enzymes in aquatic systems and play a central role in the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus. Yet, the photochemical stability of phosphatase and effects of natural organic matter (DOM) are not completely understood. We demonstrate that phosphatase activity in natural biofilm samples decreased during sunlight exposure similar to well-defined bacterial phosphatase solutions. Direct photoinactivation was slowed by more than 50% in the presence of redox-active dissolved organic matter (DOM, 10 mg(C) L-1) or a model antioxidant (esculetin, 50 mu M), even after light screening effects had been accounted for. Thus, DOM can not only inhibit enzymes (in the dark) or sensitize photodegradation by producing photochemically produced reactive intermediates but can also significantly quench direct photoinactivation of phosphatase. Our data further suggest that direct photooxidation of tryptophan residues within the protein structure are significantly involved in the photoinactivation of phosphatase because a loss of tryptophan-like fluorescence paralleled photoinactivation kinetics and because DOM acted as an antioxidant toward photoinactivation, a phenomenon recently established for the photooxidation of freely dissolved tryptophan. Thus, photoinactivation of phosphatase can be significantly slowed in the presence of naturally occurring antioxidants like DOM. The mechanistic link between tryptophan photooxidation and inactivation of phosphatase may have applicability to other extracellular enzymes but remains to be established.

When C-60 and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were present as a mixture, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generation concentrations were 1.2-1.5 times higher than the sum of O-1(2) concentrations that were produced when C60 and DOM were present in water by themselves. When C-60 and HA were present as a mixture, superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) were 2.2-2.6 times more than when C-60 and HA were present in water by themselves. A synergistic ROS photogeneration mechanism involved in energy and electron transfer between DOM and C-60 was proposed. Enhanced O-1(2) generation in the mixtures was partly due to (DOM)-D-3* energy transfer to O-2. However, it was mostly due to (DOM)-D-3* energy transfer to C-60 producing C-3(60)*. C-3(60)* has a prolonged lifetime (>4 mu s) in the mixture and provides sufficient time for energy transfer to O-2, which produces O-1(2). The enhanced O-2 generation for HA/C-60 mixture was because C-3(60)* mediated electron transfer from photoionized HA to O-2. This study demonstrates the importance of considering DOM when investigating ROS production by C-60.

Dissolved organic matter produced by Thalassiosira pseudonana	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Phytoplankton are significant producers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine ecosystems but the identity and dynamics of this DOM remain poorly constrained. Knowledge on the identity and dynamics of DOM is crucial for understanding the molecular-level reactions at the base of the global carbon cycle. Here we apply emerging analytical and computational tools from metabolomics to investigate the composition of DOM produced by the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We assessed both intracellular metabolites within T. pseudonana (the endo-metabolome) and extracellular metabolites released by T. pseudonana (the exo-metabolome). The intracellular metabolites had a more variable composition than the extracellular metabolites. We putatively identified novel compounds not previously associated with T. pseudonana as well as compounds that have previously been identified within T. pseudonana's metabolic capacity (e.g. dimethylsulfoniopropionate and degradation products of chitin). The resulting information will provide the basis for future experiments to assess the impact of T. pseudonana on the composition of dissolved organic matter in marine environments.

Mercury Isotope Fractionation during Aqueous Photoreduction of Monomethylmercury in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Monomethylmercury (MMHg) is a toxic pollutant that bioaccumulates in aquatic food webs. A major mechanism that limits MMHg uptake by biota is photodemethylation in surface waters. Recently, the extent of mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes preserved in fish is being used to quantify this MMHg sink. Here, the effects of different types and amounts of DOM on Hg MIF during MMHg photodemethylation were investigated to assess how variable MIF enrichment factors may be with respect to changing DOM binding sites. From experiments conducted with varying amounts of reduced organic sulfur (S-red-DOM), the extent and signature of MIF is likely dependent on whether MMHg is dominantly bound to Sred-DOM. Similar enrichment factors were observed for low MMHg:S-red-DOM experiments, where S-red-DOM was in far excess of MMHg. In contrast, significantly lower and variable enrichment factors were observed for experiments with higher MMHg:S-red-DOM ratios. Additionally the relationship between the two odd Hg isotopes that display MIF (Delta Hg-199/Delta Hg-201) was consistent for the low MMHg:S-red-DOM experiments, while lower Delta Hg-199/Delta Hg-201 relationships were observed for the higher MMHg:S-red-DOM experiments. These results suggest that both the extent and signature of MMHg MIF are sensitive to different ligands that bind MMHg in nature.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 6	2015	49	1					259	267		10.1021/es5034553						WOS:000347589300029	25399734

To investigate the effect of strong wind-induced sediment suspension on CDOM concentration, we carried out an in situ observation in a large, shallow lake, which is seriously affected by eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms, using a finely stratified sampling device and several automatic monitoring instruments. During the observation, a typhoon-induced strong wind with a mean wind speed of 6.6m/s swept the Lake Taihu basin. The strong wind-induced hydrodynamic disturbance caused explosive sediment suspension. During the strong winds, the maximum turbidity in the overlying waters reached 175.4 NTU, which was 12.2times the background value recorded before the strong winds. Sediment suspension resulted in the release of CDOM from within the sediment. The CDOM absorption coefficient a(355) in the overlying water showed that there was no significant difference between any two water layers for all time points during the observation (13 July to 16 July). The CDOM concentration was fully mixed along the water depth. However, the mean a(355) values recorded in all time points during the wind were higher than that before the wind (p < 0.001). The maximum value during the wind event was 2.524 +/- 0.097m(-1), which was 1.4times that of the value before the disturbance. CDOM concentrations were significantly correlated with hourly mean wind speed (p < 0.05) and turbidity (p < 0.01). Because Lake Taihu is frequently affected by strong wind processes, CDOM concentration changes caused by intense hydrodynamic disturbance are important for quantitative remote sensing of water quality and primary productivity.																	0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 2	2015	30	1			SI		143	156		10.1080/02705060.2014.961043						WOS:000349681400002

The DOM characteristics of raw water and FBWW were primarily identified and compared, and it was found that DOM in FBWW was roughly hydrophilic as compared with raw water, and the FBWW was more refractory due to a substantial increment of low-MW (< 3 KDa). Additionally, humic-like fluorophore (Peak A) and protein-like fluorophore (Peak T1), with maxima at the Ex/Em wavelengths of 245.0-265.0 nm/400.0-435.0 nm, 280.0-305.0 nm/305.0-345.0 nm, respectively, were the two main components in raw water and FBWW. Recycling trial results indicated that DOM removal efficiencies were improved with comparison to control. Specifically, all chemical fractions except hydrophobic neutral could enhance removal, but MWD was highly depended on the physical nature of raw water and FBWW. Fluorescence spectra of treated water indicated recycling FBWW could effectively improve humic-like substance (Peak A) removal, but the protein-like matter (Peak T1) was resistant to elimination or was enriched.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN 2	2015	53	1					48	56		10.1080/19443994.2013.836994						WOS:000347545200007

Bacterial influence on chromophoric dissolved organic matter in coastal waters of the northern South China Sea	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), bacterial production (BP) and phytoplankton biomass (chl a) were investigated at 2 coastal sites in the northern South China Sea during summer 2011. Our data showed that chl a levels were higher in Hong Kong eastern waters (HKEW) than Sanya Bay (SYB), but CDOM exhibited the opposite pattern. This decoupling between surface CDOM and chl a indicates that phytoplankton biomass is not the determining factor affecting CDOM distribution. The low levels of CDOM in HKEW could be associated with upwelling of CDOM-deficient deep waters. In addition, bacteria produced more CDOM during the beginning of incubation experiments at SYB than at HKEW, although CDOM turnover time by bacteria was similar to 4 to 10 d and showed no significant difference between SYB and HKEW (p > 0.05). Addition of nitrogen shortened the CDOM turnover time by 2 fold at SYB. Upwelling likely resulted in a phosphorus deficiency for bacteria, and phosphorus enrichment increased bacterial abundance (BA) and BP at HKEW. Interestingly, nitrogen enrichment increased both BP and CDOM generation in SYB, but phosphorus enrichment did not change CDOM at either location, suggesting that CDOM distribution is more associated with nitrogen than phosphorus availability.																	0948-3055	1616-1564					2015	76	3					207	217		10.3354/ame01778						WOS:000371303900004

Characteristics of dissolved organic matter in forest soils: influence of different plant covering	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT SCIENCE AND MATERIALS	AER-Advances in Engineering Research				International Forum on Energy, Environment Science and Materials (IFEESM)	SEP 25-26, 2015	Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA					To investigate the influence of different plant covering on dissolved organic matter (DOM) in forest soils, the DOM characteristics of soil sample in P. massoniana plantation forest and mixed conifer-broadleaf forest of P. massoniana and C. carlesii were researched by using chemical and spectroscopic methods, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratios, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), together with aromaticity index (AIX) and humification index (HIX). Results showed that TOC, TN and C/N ratios were much higher in soils of PC than P, together with the level of DOC and DON, and the spectroscopic characteristics of DOM including AIX and HIX. It's suggested that different plant covering in forest have great influences on soil DOM characteristics. DOM concentrations in mixed forest of P. massoniana and C. carlesii were much higher than pure conifer forest of C. carlesii. Thus, mixed conifer-broadleaf forest was more suitable choice for ecological restoration and reconstruction in southeast China.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-117-9				2015	40						1201	1206								WOS:000371023700221

Due to the complex components, it is hard to analyze fully specific organic fraction. Due to three dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence (3DEEM) technique with the merits of high sensitivity, high selectivity, simple operation, and non-destructive and less sample, it has become one reliable method to study DOM. This study gave a brief introduction for 3DEEM technique, and reviewed from the characterization of DOM and the relationship between DOM and heavy metals. Additionally, we also summarized the application of 3DEEM in DOM from natural water environment and wastewater treatment to provide the theoretical basis and technical support for geochemical cycling of pollutants and water environmental protection and control.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-117-9				2015	40						1416	1421								WOS:000371023700257

Results showed that the Cu adsorption isotherms were well fitted with both Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The Cu maximum potential adsorption capacity of the three soils followed the order of Eutric Fluvisol > Haplic Phaeozems > Haplic Acrisol. DOMw and DOMs increased the Cu adsorption capacity in Haplic Phaeozems and Haplic Acrisol, and the promoting role of DOMs on Cu adsorption was obviously higher than that of DOMw. Increasing DOM concentration of DOMw and DOMs promoted the Cu adsorption in Haplic Phaeozems and Haplic Acrisol. However, this promoting effect weakened with increasing DOM concentration. Moreover, DOMw and DOMs inhibited the Cu adsorption in Eutric Fluvisol, and this inhibitory effect significantly increased with increasing DOM concentration. The results may be used to assess the potential environmental contamination of the studied soils and to control the application of organic fertilizers.

Spectroscopic Characterization	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												To reveal the influencing mechanism of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on mercury (Hg II) adsorption by black, red, and fluvo-aquic soils in China, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy were employed to characterize the DOM samples and DOM-Hg complexes. FTIR spectra showed that the complexation of Hg (II) mainly acted on the C=O, COO, and O-H groups of DOM from swine manure (DOMs) and wheat straw (DOMw). The NMR spectra indicated that the complex reaction of Hg (II) and DOM corresponded with the change in carboxyl C. The NMR results also showed that the dominant C components in DOM were aromatic C, O-alkyl C, alkyl C, and carboxyl C, and that DOMw imposed more influence on Hg (II) adsorption than DOMs, which was consistent with that of FTIR spectroscopy. The 3DEEM showed that DOM contained both aromatic protein-like and fulvic-like substances, and that the protein-like properties of DOMs and UV fulvic-like fluorescence substances of DOMw can better participate in the formation of Hg complexes. This result provides strong direct evidence to elucidate the DOM-Hg (II) binding mechanism, and further interprets the effect mechanism of exogenous DOM on Hg adsorption by soil.

We investigated the light regimes in relation to DOM in 18 oligotrophic, high-latitude lakes across mountain birch woodland, shrub tundra and barren tundra in north-west Finnish Lapland. In 12 lakes >1% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reached the lake bottom, while 1% UV-B depth ranged from 0.1 to >12 m. Lakes located in barren tundra had highest transparency, lowest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and lowest DOM absorption (a(440)) (mean values: K-d PAR 0.3m(-1), DOC 2.1mg l(-1), a(440) 0.4m(-1)), while lakes in shrub tundra and mountain birch forest were less transparent (DOC 4.7 mg l(-1), a(440) 1.4 m(-1)). Solar attenuation and lake transparency was best explained by a(440). Our survey emphasizes the importance of catchment type on DOM characteristics and lake optics. We predict that even small changes in DOM quality may largely change the UV radiation exposure of lakes while changes in PAR may have smaller biological effects in these shallow lakes that are already illuminated to the bottom.																	1195-6860	2376-7626					2015	22	1					17	31		10.1080/11956860.2015.1047137						WOS:000369737300004

The effect of coagulant category, additional doses of diatomite and pH on coagulation efficiency was investigated and DOM was fractioned and characterized by ultra-filtration and resin adsorption techniques. The results showed that enhanced coagulation can improve the removal of turbidity and DOM. The smaller molecules (< 4 kna) and larger ones (> 30 kDa) were found to be the dominant fractions. The hydrophobic acids (HA) and the hydrophilic matter (HiM) were more abundant than hydrophobic base (HoB), hydrophobic neutral (HoN) and weak hydrophobic acid (WHoA). The results showed that the enhanced coagulation process could provide certain reduction for each molecular weight (MW) organics, WHoA, HoN and HoA fractions. It can be concluded that the MW distribution and component fraction of DOM were related to the enhanced coagulation performance.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	12C					4783	4788								WOS:000367699500011

A loess reservoir lake Khanka containing great amount of suspended inorganic matter were selected as the research object. In order to assess changes in the composition of the DOM the following parameters were selected: index of the degree exponent of absorption spectrum, the specific absorption coefficient, relative specific fluorescence yield and relative specific fluorescence,. The research has shown that not only the content of organic matter during adsorption on the surface of the suspension is changing during filtration, but also the composition.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-908-5				2015	9680								96802Y	10.1117/12.2204892						WOS:000366810300106

Spectrofluorometric characteristics of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in a surface microlayer in the Southern Baltic coastal waters	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN OPTICAL SOCIETY-RAPID PUBLICATIONS												This paper presents results of characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) using fluorescence spectroscopy in the surface microlayers (SML) and subsurface layers (SS) in the Baltic Sea. Samples for spectroscopic measurements were collected during five research cruises in April/May and October 2013 and 2014 in a surface microlayer and a subsurface layer at a depth of 1 m along two transects from the river outlets to the open sea. The first transect was located from the Vistula River outlet to the Gdansk Deep and the second transect was located from the Leba River outlet to Slupsk Furrow. Results indicated that DOM fluorescence intensity in the SML is higher by 20% compared to the SS. The Humification Index, HIX values were lower in SML than SS by 13%. That indicates that SML is depleted in molecules with high molecular weight and higher aromaticy. The inverse relationship of fluorescence intensity of dominant peaks with salinity both in SML and SS suggests that FDOM variability is regulated mostly by terrestrial DOM input.																	1990-2573						2015	10								15050	10.2971/jeos.2015.15050						WOS:000366323900001

Controls on dissolved organic matter (DOM) degradation in a headwater stream: the influence of photochemical and hydrological conditions in determining light-limitation or substrate-limitation of photo-degradation	BIOGEOSCIENCES												We investigated how absorption of sunlight by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the degradation and export of DOM from Imnavait Creek, a beaded stream in the Alaskan Arctic. We measured concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as concentrations and characteristics of CDOM and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), during ice-free periods of 2011-2012 in the pools of Imnavait Creek and in soil waters draining to the creek. Spatial and temporal patterns in CDOM and FDOM in Imnavait Creek were analyzed in conjunction with measures of DOM degradation by sunlight and bacteria and assessments of hydrologic residence times and in situ UV exposure. CDOM was the dominant light attenuating constituent in the UV and visible portion of the solar spectrum, with high attenuation coefficients ranging from 86 +/- 12 m(-1) at 305 nm to 3 +/- 1 m(-1) in the photosynthetically active region (PAR). High rates of light absorption and thus light attenuation by CDOM contributed to thermal stratification in the majority of pools in Imnavait Creek under low-flow conditions. In turn, thermal stratification increased the residence time of water and DOM, and resulted in a separation of water masses distinguished by contrasting UV exposure (i.e., UV attenuation by CDOM with depth resulted in bottom waters receiving less UV than surface waters). When the pools in Imnavait Creek were stratified, DOM in the pool bottom water closely resembled soil water DOM in character, while the concentration and character of DOM in surface water was reproduced by experimental photo-degradation of bottom water. These results, in combination with water column rates of DOM degradation by sunlight and bacteria, suggest that photo-degradation is the dominant process controlling DOM fate and export in Imnavait Creek. A conceptual model is presented showing how CDOM amount and lability interact with incident UV light and water residence time to determine whether photo-degradation is "light-limited" or "substrate-limited". We suggest that degradation of DOM in CDOM-rich streams or ponds similar to Imnavait is typically light-limited under most flow conditions. Thus, export of DOM from this stream will be less under conditions that increase the light available for DOM photo-degradation (i.e., low flows, sunny days).

J	Zhang, Y; Xie, H				Zhang, Y.; Xie, H.			Photomineralization and photomethanification of dissolved organic matter in Saguenay River surface water	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Rates and apparent quantum yields of photomineralization (AQYDOC) and photomethanification (AQY(CH4)) of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in Saguenay River surface water were determined at three widely differing dissolved oxygen concentrations ([O-2]) (suboxic, air saturation, and oxygenated) using simulated-solar radiation. Photomineralization increased linearly with CDOM absorbance photobleaching for all three O-2 treatments. Whereas the rate of photochemical dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss increased with increasing [O-2], the ratio of fractional DOC loss to fractional absorbance loss showed an inverse trend. CDOM photodegradation led to a higher degree of mineralization under suboxic conditions than under oxic conditions. AQYDOC determined under oxygenated, suboxic, and air-saturated conditions increased, decreased, and remained largely constant with photobleaching, respectively; AQYDOC obtained under air saturation with short-term irradiations could thus be applied to longer exposures. AQYDOC decreased successively from ultraviolet B (UVB) to ultraviolet A (UVA) to visible (VIS), which, alongside the solar irradiance spectrum, points to VIS and UVA being the primary drivers for photomineralization in the water column. The photomineralization rate in the Saguenay River was estimated to be 2.31 x 108 mol Cyr(-1), accounting for only 1% of the annual DOC input into this system. Photoproduction of CH4 occurred under both suboxic and oxic conditions and increased with decreasing [O-2], with the rate under suboxic conditions similar to 7-8 times that under oxic conditions. Photoproduction of CH4 under oxic conditions increased linearly with photomineralization and photobleaching. Under air saturation, 0.00057% of the photo-chemical DOC loss was diverted to CH4, giving a photochemical CH4 production rate of 4.36 x 10(6) mol m(-2) yr(-1) in the Saguenay River and, by extrapolation, of (1.9-8.1) x 10(8) mol yr(-1) in the global ocean. AQYCH(4) changed little with photobleaching under air saturation but increased exponentially under suboxic conditions. Spectrally, AQYCH(4) decreased sequentially from UVB to UVA to VIS, with UVB being more efficient under suboxic conditions than under oxic conditions. On a depth-integrated basis, VIS prevailed over UVB in controlling CH4 photoproduction under air saturation while the opposite held true under O-2-deficiency. An addition of micromolar levels of dissolved dimethyl sulfide (DMS) substantially increased CH4 photoproduction, particularly under O-2-deficiency; DMS at nanomolar ambient concentrations in surface oceans is, however, unlikely a significant CH4 precursor. Results from this study suggest that CDOM-based CH4 photoproduction only marginally contributes to the CH4 supersaturation in modern surface oceans and to both the modern and Archean atmospheric CH4 budgets, but that the photochemical term can be comparable to microbial CH4 oxidation in modern oxic oceans. Our results also suggest that anoxic microniches in particulate organic matter and phytoplankton cells containing elevated concentrations of precursors of the methyl radical such as DMS may provide potential hotspots for CH4 photoproduction.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	22					6823	6836		10.5194/bg-12-6823-2015						WOS:000365442600018

Effects of nitrate and phosphate supply on chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic: a mesocosm study	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In open-ocean regions, as is the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), pelagic production is the main source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and is affected by dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) concentrations. Changes in pelagic production under nutrient amendments were shown to also modify DOM quantity and quality. However, little information is available about the effects of nutrient variability on chromophoric (CDOM) and fluorescent (FDOM) DOM dynamics. Here we present results from two mesocosm experiments ("Varied P" and "Varied N") conducted with a natural plankton community from the ETNA, where the effects of DIP and DIN supply onDOM optical properties were studied. CDOM accumulated proportionally to phytoplankton biomass during the experiments. Spectral slope (S) decreased over time indicating accumulation of high molecular weight DOM. In Varied N, an additional CDOM portion, as a result of bacterial DOM reworking, was determined. It increased the CDOM fraction in DOC proportionally to the supplied DIN. The humic-like FDOM component (Comp.1) was produced by bacteria proportionally to DIN supply. The protein-like FDOM component (Comp.2) was released irrespectively to phytoplankton or bacterial biomass, but depended on DIP and DIN concentrations. Under high DIN supply, Comp.2 was removed by bacterial reworking, leading to an accumulation of humic-like Comp.1. No influence of nutrient availability on amino acid-like FDOM component in peptide form (Comp.3) was observed. Comp.3 potentially acted as an intermediate product during formation or degradation of Comp.2. Our findings suggest that changes in nutrient concentrations may lead to substantial responses in the quantity and quality of optically active DOM and, therefore, might bias results of the applied in situ optical techniques for an estimation of DOC concentrations in open-ocean regions.

Impact of forest harvesting on water quality and fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes in summer	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Forestry activities in the Canadian Boreal region have increased in the last decades, raising concerns about their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. Water quality and fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were measured over a 3-year period in eight eastern Boreal Shield lakes: four lakes were studied before, 1 and 2 years after forest harvesting (perturbed lakes) and compared with four undisturbed reference lakes (unperturbed lakes) sampled at the same time. ANOVAs showed a significant increase in total phosphorus (TP) in perturbed lakes when the three sampling dates were considered and in DOC concentrations when considering 1 year before and 1 year after the perturbation only. At 1 year post-clear cutting DOC concentrations were about 15% greater in the perturbed lakes at similar to 15 mgC L-1 compared to 12.5 mgC L-1 in the unperturbed lakes. In contrast, absorbance and fluorescence measurements showed that all metrics remained within narrow ranges compared to the range observed in natural waters, indicating that forest harvesting did not affect the nature of DOM characterized with spectroscopic techniques. These results confirm an impact of forestry activities 1 year after the perturbation. However, this effect seems to be mitigated 2 years after, indicating that the system shows high resilience and may be able to return to its original condition in terms of water quality parameters assessed in this study.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	23					6999	7011		10.5194/bg-12-6999-2015						WOS:000365901800011

Prescribed Fire Alters Dissolved Organic Matter and Disinfection By-Product Precursors in Forested Watersheds - Part I. A Controlled Laboratory Study	RECENT ADVANCES IN DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS	ACS Symposium Series				Symposium on Occurrence, Formation, Health Effects and Control of Disinfection By-Products in Drinking Water / 248th ACS National Meeting	AUG 10-14, 2014	San Francisco, CA	Amer Chem Soc, Div Environm Chem, Water Res Fdn				Detritus material in forested watersheds is the major terrestrial source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors in source waters. Forest fire reduces the thickness of detritus layer and changes foliar litters into pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) on the forest floor, resulting in different quantity and quality of DOM exported from forested watersheds. Many studies have examined DBP precursors exported from forested watersheds; however, DOM leaching from PyOM, or dissolved black carbon (BC), could have different reactivity in DBP formation compared to the DOM leaching from unburned detritus layer. Using controlled laboratory burning in this study, characteristics of foliar litters before and after burn were compared. Quality and quantity of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from raw and burned foliar litters commonly found in the southeastern United States, including baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), boxelder (Acer negundo), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) was compared, and evaluated for their disinfection by-product yield and specific DBP formation using a uniform formation condition test. Laboratory analysis using pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry showed that foliar litters after burn contain significantly less lignins, nitrogenous compounds, and polysaccharides because of loss of organic matter. However, both the formula numbers and relative abundance of PAHs increased, which can be a potential health concern. Water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and total nitrogen (WETN) decreased after burn and in particular raw material had less humic acid and fulvic acid-like compounds. PyOM aromaticity may be either enhanced or lowered by prescribed fire and highly depending upon the plant species. The specific formation of chloroform (a prevalent DBP species) decreased by I2%-60% for all plant species after burn. However, dissolved BC was more reactive in the formation of nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs), and the specific haloacetonitriles formation increased after burn for all species.

There is a health concern on DOM because it reacts with disinfectants to form a variety of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) during drinking water treatments. Prescribed fire is a common forest management practice in Southeastern US to reduce the risks of wildfire and beetle infestation. However, this forest management practice alters the composition and quantity of detritus materials on forest floor, changing the DOM and DBP precursors exports from those forested watersheds. In this book chapter, we discussed a prescribed fire study conducted in three 20m x 20m experimental plots in Hobcaw Barony, Georgetown, South Carolina. Litter and duff mixtures of field samples before and after prescribed fire were collected for water extraction experiments in the laboratory. In addition, water extracts were further exposed to sunlight for 15 days in order to understand the biogeochemical processes on the degradability of DOM and DBP precursors. The concentrations of water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and water extractable total nitrogen (WETN) from unburned detritus (60.3 g-WEOC/m(2) and 1.9 g-WETN/m(2)) were significantly greater than those from burned detritus (11.4 g-WEOC/m(2) and 0.5 g-WETN/m(2)). Importantly, the yield of DBP was significantly reduced from 3651 mg-THM/m(2) to 484 mg-THM/m(2) after fire. There was no change in specific DBP formation in both burn and unburned samples after sunlight exposure although significant decreases in ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence intensity were observed. This field study showed that prescribed fire could significantly decrease the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) per unit area in forest floor and potentially decrease the DBP formation in water supply.																	0097-6156		978-0-8412-3076-7				2015	1190						293	306								WOS:000365248800016

Photoreduction of Hg(II) and photodemethylation of methylmercury: the key role of thiol sites on dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												This study examined the kinetics of photoreduction of Hg(II) and photodemethylation of methylmercury (MeHg+) attached to, or in the presence of, dissolved organic matter (DOM). Both Hg(II) and MeHg+ are principally bound to reduced sulfur groups associated with DOM in many freshwater systems. We propose that a direct photolysis mechanism is plausible for reduction of Hg(II) bound to reduced sulfur groups on DOM while an indirect mechanism is supported for photodemethylation of MeHg+ bound to DOM. UV spectra of Hg(II) and MeHg+ bound to thiol containing molecules demonstrate that the Hg(II)-S bond is capable of absorbing UV-light in the solar spectrum to a much greater extent than MeHg+-S bonds. Experiments with chemically distinct DOM isolates suggest that concentration of DOM matters little in the photochemistry if there are enough reduced S sites present to strongly bind MeHg+ and Hg(II); DOM concentration does not play a prominent role in photodemethylation other than to screen light, which was demonstrated in a field experiment in the highly colored St. Louis River where photodemethylation was not observed at depths >= 10 cm. Experiments with thiol ligands yielded slower photodegradation rates for MeHg+ than in experiments with DOM and thiols; rates in the presence of DOM alone were the fastest supporting an intra-DOM mechanism. Hg(II) photoreduction rates, however, were similar in experiments with only DOM, thiols plus DOM, or only thiols suggesting a direct photolysis mechanism. Quenching experiments also support the existence of an intra-DOM photodemethylation mechanism for MeHg+. Utilizing the difference in photodemethylation rates measured for MeHg+ attached to DOM or thiol ligands, the binding constant for MeHg+ attached to thiol groups on DOM was estimated to be 1016.7.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2015	17	11					1892	1903		10.1039/c5em00305a						WOS:000364146800003	26420634

Images covered a period of 7 months, spanning from the ice melting (March) to the late summer (September) of 7 consecutive years (2005-2011). The aim of the study was to analyse the spatial and temporal variations of CDOM, by focusing on the main regulating factors (riverine discharge, sea-lagoon water exchange, water temperature, chlorophyll a, wind) in a large estuary. The working hypothesis is that CDOM distribution may reveal distinct, site specific seasonal patterns. Our results demonstrated that CDOM concentrations at the whole lagoon level were elevated (1.5-4 m(-1)) and slightly but significantly higher in spring (1.50 m(-1) on average) compared to the summer (1.45 m(-1) on average). This is due to very different flow of CDOM-rich freshwater from the main lagoon tributary in spring compared to summer. They also highlight macroscopic differences among areas within the lagoon, depending on season, suggesting a complex regulation of CDOM in this system. Significant factors explaining observed differences are the dilution of lagoon water with CDOM-poor brackish water, regeneration of large amounts of dissolved organic matter from sediments and combinations of uptake/release from phytoplankton. CDOM and its variations are understudied due to inherent methodological and analytical difficulties. However, this pool has a demonstrated relevant role in the biogeochemistry of aquatic environments. We speculate that the dissolved organic pool in the Curonian Lagoon has a mainly allochthonous origin in the high discharge period and an autochthonous origin in the summer, algal bloom period. Both positive and negative relationships between CDOM and phytoplankton suggest that pelagic microalgae may act as a source or as a sink of this pool, in particular when inorganic nutrients are limiting.

Sea-water CDOM had featureless absorption increasing exponentially with shorter wavelengths. Sea ice showed distinct absorption peaks in the ultraviolet, especially in younger ice. Older first-year sea ice had relatively flat absorption spectra in the ultraviolet range. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified five fluorescent CDOM components, two humic-like and three protein-like. Sea water was largely governed by humic-like fluorescence. In sea ice, protein-like fluorescence was found in considerable excess relative to sea water. The accumulation of protein-like CDOM fluorescence in sea ice is likely a result of biological activity within the ice. Nevertheless, sea ice does not contribute excess CDOM during melt, but the material released will be of different composition than that present in the underlying waters. Thus, at least transiently, the CDOM introduced during sea-ice melt might provide a more labile source of fresher protein-like DOM to surface waters in the southern Sea of Okhotsk.																	0260-3055	1727-5644					2015	56	69	1				1	8		10.3189/2015AoG69A002						WOS:000363082900002

Phytoextraction, as a promising friendly technique, has a main drawback: low mobility and bioavailability of Cd. In this study, the influences of dissolved organic matter derived from chicken manure (DOMc), humus soil (DOMs), and rice hull (DOMr) on Cd speciation in soil solution, and the uptake of Cd by a hyper-accumulating ecotype (HE) and a non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) of Crassulaceae were investigated. After the addition of exogenous DOM and subsequent plant growth, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration increase resulted in a higher proportion of Cd-DOM complexation. Moreover, DOM derived from the chicken manure had the highest degree of Cd complex formation in rhizosphere soil, followed by DOMs and DOMr. Furthermore, because of the increasing fraction of Cd-DOM, the solvation of Cd in the soil matrix was remarkably favored. However, growth of HE decreased the dissolved Cd in rhizosphere soil solution compared to bulk soil, and may be attributed to the phytoaccumulation of Cd by HE plants. In addition, the amount of Cd phytoextracted by plants significantly increased with DOM concentration. The Cd concentrations in the HE shoots were in the range of 754.3 similar to 4234.2 mg.kg(-1) (DOMc), 714.9 similar to 4015.8 mg.kg(-1) (DOMs), and 656.7 similar to 900.4 mg.kg(-1) (DOMr), and were 15.4 similar to 47.0, 17.4 similar to 23.9, and 16.9 similar to 22.6 times higher than the NHE samples, respectively.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2015	24	5					2035	2044		10.15244/pjoes/41500						WOS:000363005000018		
J	Li, HY; Minor, EC				Li, Hongyu; Minor, Elizabeth C.			Dissolved organic matter in Lake Superior: insights into the effects of extraction methods on chemical composition	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic systems plays many biogeochemical roles, acting as a sunscreen, a food source, a trace metal chelator, and a photosensitizer. The efficiency of DOM in these roles is, in part, a function of its composition, which is difficult to determine due to its heterogeneity and the difficulty in isolating representative portions for subsequent molecular level analyses. In this study, the performance of two major types of solid phase extraction (SPE) resins (C18 vs. polymeric SDVB) in disk format (C18 disk vs. SDB-XC disk) was studied using DOM from Lake Superior, the earth's largest lake by area. The performance of the two SPE disks and their influences on the molecular chemical composition of the extracted retentates were studied with UV-vis spectrometry and negative-ion electrospray Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS). We found that SDB-XC disks outperformed C18 disks in the isolation of DOM in terms of both higher recovery and less fractionation relative to the initial DOM composition. Extracts of the same samples obtained with the different resins shared 70% of molecular formulae. Compounds exclusive to the SDB-XC extractions exhibited similar compound distributions to those of the shared formulae but were enriched in N, P, and S and more aromatic. The C18 exclusive compounds had somewhat higher H/C ratios and contained a large proportion of compounds with oxygen and nitrogen (CHON). Cluster analysis and principle component analysis confirmed that sample location was the main driver of the composition of extracted samples but showed some fractionation of the samples based upon the type of resin.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2015	17	10					1829	1840		10.1039/c5em00199d						WOS:000362429000012	26350791

The results showed that the RS and ADS matrices achieved the desired biodrying performance after 18 days. Biodrying caused a decrease in the dissolved organic carbon content and an increase in the molecular weight, aromaticity, and fluorescent intensity of DOM in the sludge matrices. Compared with the RS matrix, the organic matter of the ADS was more biostable, resulting in a lower biodrying performance. The asynchronous map of 2D FTIR COS analysis showed the changes in the heteropolysaccharide first, followed by the protein-like groups in the matrices during the biodrying process, which was contrary to the previous results from anaerobic digestion. They supply the first evidence for the complementarities of anaerobic and aerobic processes in sludge organic compound degradation. 2D FTIR COS analysis is a feasible technique to explore the degradation characteristics of individual organic matters during the sludge treatment.				li, xiaowei/G-6418-2011													2046-2069						2015	5	100					82087	82096		10.1039/c5ra13069g						WOS:000362437900037

This study provides more information for ecological environment government and restoration of Lake Baiyangdian. Four components were identified in the upper samples (0-5cm), including UV fulvic-like (peak A), protein-like (peak T-2 and peak T-1) and visual fulvic-like (peak C). The same components were found in the lower samples (5-10 cm) in a different configuration: Two UV fulvic-like (peak A(1) and peak A(2)), protein-like (peak T) and visual fulvic-like (peak C). The variation was caused by the different horizonal and vertical distribution the samples. Protein-like substances dominated in all samples, especially in the upper samples, while UV fulvic-like and protein-like substances dominated in the lower samples together. UV-Vis spectra results suggest that the percentage of aromatic was higher in cleaner water regions and lower in water regions that receive more pollutants, and that the degree of humification increased from the sediment surface to the lower samples. Correlation analyses represented the relationships among the different parameters and integrated them. The results indicated that wastewater discharge and aquaculture are the main reasons for DOM variation in Lake Baiyangdian.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	3					839	848								WOS:000361782000018

A comparison between the chemical characteristics of DOM extracted from these three regions was performed using UV-visible spectrometry (UV-vis), excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The UV-vis and EEM spectra revealed that the DOM in stormwater runoff samples mainly contained UV humic-like (peak A) compositions with higher molecular weights. H-1 NMR analysis indicated that the DOM of the three regions contained a similar distribution of functional groups, which mainly consisted of aliphatic chains and aromatic components with carbonyl, hydroxyl or alkyl terminal groups. And the UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS demonstrated the identification and characterization of possible compounds existing in the DOM. Further studies should focus on the interactive relationship between DOM and the co-existing contaminants (heavy metals and some typical organic pollutants) in stormwater runoff.																	2046-2069						2015	5	90					73490	73500		10.1039/c5ra14993b						WOS:000360860500021

The complexes of montmorillonite (MT) and kaolinite (KL) with DOM extracted from landfill leachate were prepared under controlled conditions, termed CMT and CKL, respectively. The bare clays and their complexes were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Batch experiments were designed to investigate the sorption behavior of pyrene onto the clays in the presence of DOM. The maximum sorption capacities of pyrene on MT, CMT, KL, and CKL were 22.18, 38.96, 42.00, and 44.99, respectively, at the initial concentration of 1000 + 150 mu g.L-1. The sorption isotherms of pyrene by the bare clays followed the Henry model well, whereas the Freundlich sorption isotherm provided a better fit to the equilibrium data of the sorption by the complexes. The role of montmorilionite and kaolinite complexes with DOM in the retention of pyrene in soils was different. This may be due to the different crystal structures between montmorillonite and kaolinite.

Sources of dissolved organic matter during storm and inter-storm conditions in a lowland headwater catchment: constraints from high-frequency molecular data	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The transfer of dissolved organic matter (DOM) at soil-river interfaces controls the biogeochemistry of micropollutants and the equilibrium between continental and oceanic C reservoirs. Understanding the mechanisms controlling this transfer is fundamental to ecology and geochemistry. DOM delivery to streams during storms is assumed to come from the flushing of preexisting soil DOM reservoirs mobilized by the modification of water flow paths. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the evolution of the composition of stream DOM during inter-storm conditions and five storm events monitored with high-frequency sampling. The composition of DOM was analyzed using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) coupled to a gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer. In inter-storm conditions, stream DOM is derived from the flushing of soil DOM, while during storm events, the modification of the distribution of chemical biomarkers allows the identification of three additional mechanisms. The first one corresponds to the destabilization of microbial biofilms due to the increase in water velocity, resulting in the fleeting export of a microbial pool. The second mechanism corresponds to the erosion of soils and river banks, leading to a partition of organic matter between particulate and dissolved phases. The third mechanism is linked to the increase in water velocity in soils that could induce the erosion of macropore walls, leading to an in-soil partition between soil microparticles and dissolved phase. The contribution of this in-soil erosive process would be linked to the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient following the rise of the water table and could persist after the recession, which could explain why the return to inter-storm composition of DOM does not follow the same temporal scheme as the discharge. These results are the most important factors in understanding the transfer of nutrients and micropollutants at the soil-river interfaces during the hot moments that are storm events.

Liz			Characterisation of dissolved organic matter in the Lower Kinabatangan River, Sabah, Malaysia	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Spatial patterns and trends in the concentration and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are characterised across a tropical agricultural catchment using ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Related determination of the environmental isotopes O-18 and H-2 clarify the dynamics of catchment water movement. Water samples were collected from the Kinabatangan River, Borneo, and selected tributaries in August and September 2008 in four regions with oil palm plantations (KB1, KB2, KB3 and KB4). The isotopic compositions of surface waters suggest that canals were characterised by a strong evaporative effect than tributaries and streams with more natural, forested vegetation. DOM was characterised by variations in UV absorbance and spectral slope. Individual fluorescence excitation-emission matrices were decomposed by Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) and three components extracted (C1, C2 and C3). Components C2 and C3 both appear to be derived from microbial sources and/or photo-degradation. The PARAFAC components indicate a clear trend of increasing DOM degradation as waters pass through the catchment. It is hypothesised that upstream DOM is rapidly photo and microbially degraded to less fluorescent DOM, while DOM concentration and character of DOM downstream is controlled by the hydrology, specifically by variations in the rate of water movement.

The contribution of mycosporine-like amino acids, chromophoric dissolved organic matter and particles to the UV protection of sea-ice organisms in the Baltic Sea	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on the synthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) in sea-ice communities and on the other UV-absorption properties of sea ice were studied in a three-week long in situ experiment in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea in March 2011. The untreated snow-covered ice and two snow-free ice treatments, one exposed to wavelengths > 400 nm (PAR) and the other to full solar spectrum (PAR + UVR), were analysed for MAAs and absorption coefficients of dissolved (a(CDOM)) and particulate (a(p)) fractions, the latter being further divided into non-algal (a(nap)) and algal (a(ph)) components. Our results showed that the diatom and dinoflagellate dominated sea-ice algal community responded to UVR down to 25-30 cm depth by increasing their MAA : chlorophyll-a ratio and by extending the composition of MAA pool from shinorine and palythine to porphyra-334 and an unknown compound with absorption peaks at ca. 335 and 360 nm. MAAs were the dominant absorbing components in algae in the top 10 cm of ice, and their contribution to total absorption became even more pronounced under UVR exposure. In addition to MAAs, the high absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and by deposited atmospheric particles provided UV-protection for sea-ice organisms in the exposed ice. Efficient UV-protection will especially be of importance under the predicted future climate conditions with more frequent snow-free conditions.

J	Su, YL; Chen, FZ; Liu, ZW				Su, Yaling; Chen, Feizhou; Liu, Zhengwen			Comparison of optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in alpine lakes above or below the tree line: insights into sources of CDOM	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Here we investigated absorption and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in 15 alpine lakes located below or above the tree line to determine its source and composition. The results indicate that the concentrations of CDOM in below-tree-line lakes are significantly higher than in above-tree-line lakes, as evidenced from the absorption coefficients of a250 and a365. The intensities of the protein-like and humic-like fluorescence in below-tree-line lakes are higher than in above-tree-line lakes as well. Three fluorescent components were identified using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modelling. Component 1 is probably associated with biological degradation of terrestrial humic component. The terrestrial humic-like component 2 is only found in below-tree-line lakes. The protein-like or phenolic component 3 is dominant in above-tree-line lakes, which is probably more derived from autochthonous origin. In this study, (1) higher a250/a365 and S275-295 values indicate smaller molecular weights of CDOM in above-tree-line lakes than in below-tree-line lakes, and smaller molecular weights at the surface than at 2.0 m depth; (2) SUVA254 and FI255 results provide evidence of lower percent aromaticity of CDOM in above-tree-line lakes; and (3) FI310 and FI370 suggest a strong allochthonous origin at the surface in below-tree-line lakes, and more contribution from autochthonous biological and aquatic bacterial origin in above-tree-line lakes.																	1474-905X	1474-9092					2015	14	5					1047	1062		10.1039/c4pp00478g						WOS:000354208500020	25694220

DOC concentrations in a hydrophobic fraction (O-DOC), which is extracted by solid phase extraction, accounted for 34 and 38% of bulk organic carbon in the surface and deep layer. FDOMM in a hydrophobic fraction (O-FDOMM) acceunted for 78 and 37% of FDOMM in the surface and 1000-m depth seawater, respectively. Molecular weight distribution of O-FDOMM and 0-DOC showed that ratio of the fluorescence intensity to the DOC concentration of each MW fraction increased with depth. This suggests that the contribution of O-FDOMM to O-DOC in the deeper seawater is higher than that in the surface layer. When deep-seawater samples were irradiated by natural sunlight for 5 days, the fluorescence intensity of O-FDOMM decreased to almost half and its molecular weight shifted to lower one, whereas the O-DOC concentration did not decrease. It implies that a part of O-FDOMM remains as photobleached FDOMM (no-fluorescence DOM) after photobleaching.																	0016-7002	1880-5973					2015	49	2					175	184		10.2343/geochemj.2.0343						WOS:000353871300004

An approach to derive CDOM using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was developed that may be more accessible to water quality managers by selecting an off-the-shelf software and algorithm with standard atmospheric correction. This study focused on demonstrating the transferability of a remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) band ratio algorithm, R-rs(667)/R-rs(488), previously developed to derive CDOM absorption (a(g(lambda))) at multiple MODIS wavebands in open ocean and coastal waters to the United States northern Gulf of Mexico estuaries. In situ calibration regressions at 412, 443, 469, and 488 nm had coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.76, 0.71, 0.69, and 0.57, respectively. Waveband calibrations at 531, 547, and 555 nm were below R-2 = 0.50, and therefore were not considered further. MODIS R-rs, from the standard atmospheric correction, followed nearly identical spectral shapes to the in situ HyperSAS R-rs, but were on average 0.002 + 0.0004 sr(-1) less. A satellite to in situ validation match-up window of <= 1 hour was selected with an R-2 = 0.82 and root mean square error (RMSE = 1.79) at 412 nm. An in situ water quality mooring demonstrated that the overall response and range of MODIS a(g(412)) were similar, with relative mean error from -32% to 42%. The advantage to managers was synoptic coverage across multiple estuaries and the ability to provide estimates of derived water quality parameters between the water quality assessment programme sample collection periods, which could offer more holistic assessment.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2015	36	8					2219	2237		10.1080/01431161.2015.1035408						WOS:000353577600013		
J	Swiderska-Broz, M; Wolska, M				Swiderska-Broz, Maria; Wolska, Malgorzata			Effects of Granulated Active Carbon Bed Regeneration on Dissolved Organic Matter Removal from Surface Water	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												This paper presents the effects of thermal regeneration of granulated active carbon (GAC) inhabited by microorganisms on the efficiency of dissolved organic matter removal from surface water. The thermal regeneration of the bed ensured a change in the shares of the particular organic matter fractions. The regeneration of GAC resulted in an increase in refractive organic matter removal and in a considerable reduction in biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) removal. However, the process of bringing the deposit back to biological activity was found to be long (about four months) and did not ensure the pre-regeneration efficiency of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon removal.

J	Balch, J; Gueguen, C				Balch, J.; Gueguen, C.			Determination of diffusion coefficients of dissolved organic matter in the Churchill River estuary system, Hudson Bay (Canada)	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Diffusion coefficients (D) and the molecular weight distribution (MW) of 18 dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples collected in the Churchill River estuary system (Manitoba, Canada) were determined using a diffusive cell apparatus. NaN3 addition has been shown to preserve the DOMMWdistribution within 5 weeks of collection whereas the diffusive properties (i. e. D) were strongly influenced by storage conditions, suggesting D must be determined on freshly collected material. Aquatic DOM from the river and estuarine sites was capable of diffusing across a polyacrylamide diffusive gel membrane with mean D values ranging from 2.74 x 10(-6) to 6.98 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) and from 2.42 x 10(-6) to 10.7 x 10(-6) cm(2)s(-1) respectively, congruent with previous studies using humic substances and natural DOM. The molecular weight of the river and estuary DOM samples (similar to 400-830 Da) measured using asymmetrical flow-field flow fractionation (AF4) strongly influenced D, with larger MW DOM having lower D values. Conductivity had a significant negative correlation with D in estuarine samples collected at high and low tides (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.46 respectively). These results suggest that MW and conductivity can significantly influence D of DOM in river and marine-dominated sites respectively.																	1448-2517	1449-8979					2015	12	2					253	260		10.1071/EN14182						WOS:000351999300017		
J	Xie, ZG; Guan, W				Xie, Zhigang; Guan, Wei			Research on Fluorescence Spectroscopy Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Matter of Landfill Leachate in the Rear Part of Three Gorges Reservoir	JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY												Three-dimensional fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy analysis of the leachate dissolved organic matter (DOM) of the Three Gorges was reported in spring, summer, and autumn seasons, respectively. Studies show that, that organic matter of landfill leachate in Yongchuan, Dazu and Jiangjin is the class of fulvic-like acid and protein-like fluorescence. The study also found that the longer the time of the pile of garbage, the lower the content of class of protein-like concentration, and the higher the concentration of fulvic-like acid, indicating that the protein waste material in the humification process is easy degradation. However, the same source of DOM is similar in the functional group composition and molecular structure. Characteristic frequency area analysis showed that humic acids (HA), and fulvic acids (FA) contain more than hydrophilic organic matter (HyI) aromatic ring structure, and FA aromatic ring structure is the most. Because of Chung-amide NH deformation vibration, there are strong absorption peaks in the 1562 similar to 1572 cm(-1) for various components; HyI contains many organic nitrogen compounds and fatty acids.																	2314-4920	2314-4939					2015							1	9	785406	10.1155/2015/785406						WOS:000352440100001		
J	Warner, DL; Oviedo-Vargas, D; Royer, TV				Warner, Daniel L.; Oviedo-Vargas, Diana; Royer, Todd V.			Evaluation of passive samplers for the collection of dissolved organic matter in streams	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Traditional sampling methods for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in streams limit opportunities for long-term studies due to time and cost constraints. Passive DOM samplers were constructed following a design proposed previously which utilizes diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose as a sampling medium, and they were deployed throughout a temperate stream network in Indiana. Two deployments of the passive samplers were conducted, during which grab samples were frequently collected for comparison. Differences in DOM quality between sites and sampling methods were assessed using several common optical analyses. The analyses revealed significant differences in optical properties between sampling methods, with the passive samplers preferentially collecting terrestrial, humic-like DOM. We assert that the differences in DOM composition from each sampling method were caused by preferential binding of complex htunic compounds to the DEAE cellulose in the passive samplers. Nonetheless, the passive samplers may provide a cost-effective, integrated sample of DOM in situations where the bulk DOM pool is composed mainly of terrestrial, humic-like compounds.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2015	187	1							4208	10.1007/s10661-014-4208-5						WOS:000351537100001	25504195
