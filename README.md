# DOC/aCDOM project

## Motivations

Numerous studies are presenting graphics or data about the famous DOC/acdom relationships. However, there are at least two potential problems:

1. Given that results are often study-specific, we are clearly missing the big picture since the results are rarely discussed from a broader perspective.

2. People are using different wavelengths (300, 355, 254, …) to present acdom data, hence preventing literature comparisons.

The idea of this project is to use published data and to explore the relationships between DOC and acdom across a large gradient of ecosystems (from lakes to open ocean) in order to highlight potential drivers influencing such relationships. Additionally, we could use this opportunity to:

Provide a “standard” value for the wavelength used to report acdom.

Find patterns or drivers in CDOM/DOC relationship.

Provide/advertise an open CDOM repository (database) where researchers could deposit their published data. Given that cdom is nowadays routinely measured in most ecological studies, this could provide a central point for further research on CDOM.
