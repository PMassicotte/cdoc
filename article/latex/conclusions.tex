\section*{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

This study shows that colloidal particles (0.2-0.7 $\mu$m) can influence considerably the spectral signature of CDOM in aquatic ecosystems. DOM is a central theme in ecology and more efforts are currently used to understand its roles on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems at global scales. Although there is a growing need to combine optical datasets to formulate and test new hypotheses about DOM biogeochemical cycling, combining CDOM absorption measurements from disparate sources might not be a straightforward process because colloidal material may significantly increase scattering and subsequently the spectral signature of the CDOM pool.
