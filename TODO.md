# White DOC

## Spencer 2012a

> DOM produced via autochthonous processes has previously been shown to be decoupled from DOC accumulation, and photodegradative processes are known to remove CDOM preferentially over DOC (Moran et al., 2000; Opsahl and Zepp,2001; Rochelle-Newall and Fisher, 2002).

> The strong correlations observed between DOC and a254, a350 and a440 for U.S. rivers except the Colorado, Colombia, Rio Grande and St. Lawrence are indicative of the dominance of predominantly allochthonous DOM in these watersheds (Table 3, Figure 5). The relationship between DOC and CDOM absorption for all U.S. rivers also generally exhibits a negative intercept and is always potentially negative within standard error (Table 3) clearly showing that not all DOC is chromophoric.

- Have a look to the intercept of the DOC/CDOM relation and see if it is also negative (see their Table 3).

# Molecular weight

Use the linear regression in Stedmon 2015 (book chapter) to estimate the global molecular weight of the DOM pool in different ecosystem.

> When comparing across a wide range of contrasting aquatic systems, there is a negative correlation between S and weighted average molecular weight of DOM (Figure 10.4), which suggests that S can be used as a simple proxy for average molecular weight (Floge and Wells, 2007; Green and Blough, 1994; Gu√©guen and Cuss, 2011).
